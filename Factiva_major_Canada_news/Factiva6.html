<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">* Fairfax takes stake in Stelco</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Brian Belski is still bullish on the Toronto stock market. It's the people buying the stocks who may not be.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Belski, chief investment strategist at <span class="companylink">BMO</span> Nesbitt Burns, believes 2018 was a year of what might have been, that Canadian stocks should have done better, but that next year will still see gains on the S&P/TSX Composite Index as fundamentals win out.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Instead of focusing on fundamental realities, such as improving earnings, contracting valuations and expanding dividends, investors focused on what they did not have,” Mr. Belski and his team said in their 2019 outlook.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Namely, a rebound in oil prices, emerging market stabilization, a business-friendly policy shift in Ottawa, and an overall renewed foreign interest in Canadian equities,” they added.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“As such, the resounding attitude and question that has dominated the majority of our Canadian-centric client meetings in 2018 has been, ‘Why would anyone even consider investing in Canada?’”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Here's why they should, according to Mr. Belski, principal author of the report, and the rest of the team, senior investment strategist Nicholas Roccanova, investment strategist Ryan Bohren and associate Andrew Birstingl.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"According to our models, Canadian fundamentals are the strongest they have been in several years. For instance, earnings are consistently exceeding expectations and hitting new all-time highs, profitability is near peak levels, and estimates have been getting revised higher month after month."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Not only that, but ...</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"However, the Canadian 'Eeyore' trade remains in full effect as the TSX hangs in limbo with fears surrounding slowing emerging markets, widening Canadian oil price spreads, and trade issues all weighing on TSX performance. As such, we believe the steep discount of Canadian equities provides investors with an attractive entry point given our broadly bullish outlook."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Belski’s original call was for the TSX to end 2018 at 17,600, though he revised that to push the target out further.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">BMO</span> team's base case now sees the key index at 18,000 by the end of next year as "valuations normalize from current lows back to historical averages," corporate earnings rise, Canadian oil prices come back to life and the U.S. economy remains strong.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Their bull scenario would see the index surge to 20,500 amid stronger-than-expected global economic growth, far perkier corporate earnings, a breakout in crude prices and a softer-than-forecast impact from tariffs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Then there’s the bear, or basket case, scenario, if you will, which sees 14,000 as U.S. growth flatlines, emerging markets weaken, oil prices falter, metal prices sink and “risk premiums remain elevated on continued global growth risk.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That 18,000, by the way, would still see the TSX trailing the projected gains of the S&P 500, whose base case would see that benchmark end 2019 at 3,150. But it would still mark a fresh high.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Furthermore, our base case could actually end up being too low if/when the triggers that everyone seems to be waiting for are actually pulled," the <span class="companylink">BMO</span> outlook said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Indeed as long-term investors, we would not wait around and instead focus on a diversified list of companies that will benefit from continued regional strength (as America goes, so goes Canada), as well as preparing for a potential surprise domestic recovery in Canada.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">BMO</span> economists noted in a separate report that the TSX has "persistently lagged" U.S. stocks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If you look at the last five years, Toronto stocks have chalked up an annualized gain shy of 3 per cent, compared with almost 10 per cent for the S&P 500, said chief economist Douglas Porter, senior economist Robert Kavcic and Benjamin Reitzes, Canadian rates and macro strategist.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of course, the pinch on oil prices isn't helping the cause, they said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“While the Canadian market suffers from a lack of exposure to what has been working best this cycle (namely technology and consumer discretionary), weakness in oil and the differential have both played a role as well. Keep in mind that energy is still 18 per cent of the TSX versus 5 per cent in the S&P 500.”</p>

<span class="companylink">Nissan</span> to oust Ghosn</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Carlos Ghosn’s days at <span class="companylink">Nissan Motor Co</span>. are numbered after his arrest and what the Japanese auto maker said were the findings of an internal probe into alleged misconduct by its chairman.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another official is also involved, the company said today.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Its investigation showed that Mr. Ghosn, one of the best-known names in the industry and also the CEO of Renault, and the other official “have been reporting compensation amounts in the <span class="companylink">Tokyo Stock Exchange</span> securities report that were less than the actual amount, in order to reduce the disclosed amount of Carlos Ghosn’s compensation,” <span class="companylink">Nissan</span> said in a statement.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Also, in regards to Ghosn, numerous other significant acts of misconduct have been uncovered, such as personal use of company assets.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Chief executive officer Hiroto Saikawa will ask the board to “promptly remove” Mr. Ghosn from his positions, <span class="companylink">Nissan</span> added.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“As if the European auto sector didn’t have enough problems, the surprise arrest of Renault CEO and Nissan chairman Carlos Ghosn has rattled shares in the French auto giant sending them to their lowest levels since 2014,” said CMC Markets chief analyst Michael Hewson.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Coming as it does on the back of a shift in consumer car-buying habits, as well as the prospect of significant changes in the regulatory framework, the last thing one of the world’s biggest auto makers needs is the disruption caused by an investigation into the behaviour of a man who has towered over the global auto sector,” he added.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What to watch for this week</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Let's call it Red Wednesday. Which will be followed two days later by Black Friday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The first, because Ottawa's fiscal update is certain to continue spilling red ink. The second, because the annual post-Thanksgiving retail scramble in the U.S. tends to result in shoppers fighting over bargains, oft resulting in fisticuffs and black eyes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On the first, economists expect to see Finance Minister Bill Morneau deliver a fall economic statement that’s long on deficits – long, as in a long time – and short on stimulus – short, as in falling short of U.S. tax reform.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Despite a buoyant economy, any step the government takes away from the current fiscal path is likely to be in the direction of larger deficits," said Royal Bank of Canada chief economist Craig Wright.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Ottawa long ago abandoned any pretense of balancing the budget in favour of targeting the debt-to-GDP ratio, which is a very weak fiscal anchor and encourages fiscal policy that exaggerates the economic cycle,” he added.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"This approach has enabled rapid growth in program spending, which averaged 6.5 per cent annually over the last three years from an average of 1.5 per cent in the preceding three years.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This follows Ontario’s fiscal update last week, which pledged to tackle the deficit but with no timeline attached.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists like to see governments preparing for a rainy day by reining in their budget shortfalls in good times.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Observers also expect Mr. Morneau to move on the tax side, as many economists have cited the competitive issues Canada faces in the wake of the Trump administration’s measures.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Although it’s only a fiscal update, not a budget, many are hoping Finance Minister Morneau will unveil at least a partial response to the competitive challenges posed by last year’s U.S. tax reforms," said CIBC World Markets chief economist Avery Shenfeld.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"In particular, markets are watching for a made-in-Canada version of the accelerated depreciation allowances provided to American corporates undertaking capital investments in that country," he added in a lookahead.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Recent comments, he said, "suggest that the government won’t fully match the 100-per-cent bonus depreciation in the U.S."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the U.S., it’s a crucial Black Friday, warned CMC’s Mr. Hewson, in London.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Major American retailers "have struggled to keep up with changing consumer shopping habits," Mr. Hewson said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“From the collapse of <span class="companylink">Toys 'R' Us</span> to the bankruptcy of <span class="companylink">Sears</span> last month, Black Friday is likely to make or break the years for further U.S. retailers. Already this year, store closures have been a feature of well-known brands like <span class="companylink">JC Penney</span>, <span class="companylink">Macy’s</span>, <span class="companylink">Walgreens</span>, Gap and <span class="companylink">Sears</span>.”</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MONDAY</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It promises to be a slow kickoff to a week that will slow down further for markets on Thanksgiving in the U.S.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Key, though, will be where oil prices head after the recent tumble and the wide differential between Canadian and global benchmarks.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Besides reports on October building permits and housing starts in the U.S., there are some notable corporate results, including <span class="companylink">Best Buy Co</span>. and <span class="companylink">George Weston Ltd</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It will be interesting, too, as <span class="companylink">Lowe's Cos</span>. can be expected to elaborate on its recent store closures, many of them in Canada, while we also get the latest from <span class="companylink">Target Corp</span>., which, of course, famously has no stores in Canada.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Carolyn Wilkins, the Bank of Canada's senior deputy governor, speaks at <span class="companylink">McGill University</span>, and her comments "will be watched for hints as to whether the recent drop in oil prices has changed the BoC’s thinking regarding interest rate hikes," said CIBC's Mr. Shenfeld.</p>

</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WEDNESDAY</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are some second-tier U.S. and Canadian economic reports, results from <span class="companylink">Deere & Co</span>. and <span class="companylink">Metro Inc</span>., and, of course, Mr. Morneau's update after markets close.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">THURSDAY</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. markets are closed, so it will obviously be a slower day.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Thus, a good day if British politicians want to own the headlines with, say, a non-confidence vote against Prime Minister Theresa May over her Brexit deal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That doesn’t mean there will be such a showdown, or that it could be Thursday, just that it would be a good day for it if anyone so chose.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Such a move would mean further angst among investors and more trouble for the pound.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A vote appears likely at some point, said CMC's Mr. Hewson. But "is the appetite there to unseat the prime minister, and who would take her place?" he added, noting any successor would face "the same unpalatable choices" over Brexit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“For the last few days we’ve had MPs take to the airwaves criticizing what they don’t like about the deal, however, we’ve heard precious little about what they would vote for, and this is part of the problem, and time is running out,” Mr. Hewson said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Partisan politics is all well and good but on something as weighty as Brexit the country deserves better."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Besides watching for fights at U.S. shopping malls, investors will be eyeing <span class="companylink">Statistics Canada</span>’s reports on October inflation and September retail sales.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists generally expect the report to show consumer prices rose 0.1 per cent from September, with annual inflation holding at 2.2 per cent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The retail report is expected to show little change in the value of sales from a month earlier, but possibly a dip.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CALGARY, Alberta, Nov. 19, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- <span class="companylink">Bengal Energy Ltd</span>. (TSX: BNG) (“Bengal” or the “Company”) announces that it has entered into an amendment (the “Amendment”) to its secured credit facility (the “Credit Facility”) with the Australian based Westpac Institutional Bank (“<span class="companylink">Westpac</span>”), which includes a 14 month deferral of all principal payments on the Credit Facility. Pursuant to the Amendment, the Credit Facility has a new maturity date of February 15, 2020 (the “New Maturity Date”) and provides the continuance of the borrowing base of US$12.5 million, of which the full amount is currently drawn.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Company will now be required to make a single principal repayment of US$12.5MM on the New Maturity Date, with no principal payments being required until such date. There were no changes to the covenants and cash sharing requirements under the Credit Facility.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Company is now planning to undertake the following development activities in calendar 2019, to be funded from the Company’s cash balance and cash flows:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">* A six well drilling program on the Barta Permit, ATP 752, including one exploration well; and</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">* A water injection pilot project deployed within the Cuisinier oil field on the Barta Permit. Bengal will continue to hedge approximately 50% of its crude oil production as required under the Credit Facility.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“This extension demonstrates the strong support from our lenders at <span class="companylink">Westpac</span> and delivers additional value to our shareholders,” said Chayan Chakrabarty, Bengal’s President and CEO. “The financial flexibility afforded by the extension provides additional liquidity to move forward with our aggressive development drilling program in 2019 targeted at growing our production, cash flow and reserves base, which in turn positions us well for continuing further development of the Cuisinier oil field.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Copies of the Credit Facility, including the Amendment, are available under the Company’s profile on www.sedar.com[http://www.sedar.com].</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CALENDAR 2019 DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">* Hydraulic Stimulation Program – In December 2018, the Company and its joint venture partners will hydraulically stimulate the Cuisinier-19 well and are expected to connect it for production by the end of 2018. This well encountered a 12.5 m thick, oil-bearing section of Murta sandstone and is in a portion of the oil field anticipated to have virgin reservoir pressure. Additional locations potentially suitable for stimulation continue to be identified by Bengal for upcoming programs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">* 2019 Drilling Program – Bengal and its joint venture partners on the ATP 752 Barta Block (Bengal’s working interest is 30.357%.) will participate in a six-well drilling program commencing in Q2 2019. Five of the six wells in this drilling program will be located in the Cuisinier oil field aimed at high graded targets for productivity, reserves growth and pool expansion. The sixth well will be an exploration well on the Barta permit, proximal to the Cuisinier pool. Two of the five wells will be directly offsetting the planned water injection pilot, bringing the total number of wells expected to be impacted by injection to five, thus complementing the goals of the water injection pilot to enhance reservoir performance in that area of the pool. Another two wells are located in the northwest portion of the pool where thick Murta reservoir has been established in existing wells (Cuisinier-1 & -4). These wells are targeting increased production while extending this mapped trend, potentially increasing reserves while providing a site for potential water injection expansion in future phases. The fifth well is located west of the Cuisinier-19 well, in an area where seismic attribute mapping highlights the potential for significant reservoir sand development. A successful outcome at this location could provide a new development platform for subsequent years’ drilling. The location of the exploration well is yet to be confirmed among the joint venture partners. There are a number of dual target features inside the Cuisinier PL 303 and immediately adjacent to Cuisinier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">* Water Injection Pilot – A water injection pilot project is expected to commence at Cuisinier in Q2 2019. This program is designed to begin increasing pressure in the Cuisinier pool and thereby increase the expected oil recovery and enhance productivity and reserves. The location of the water injection pilot was based on the well to well correlation of both reservoir sand and reservoir pressure, suggesting a high degree of continuity. Bengal expects the response to injection at Cuisinier-24 to be recognized early through close monitoring of all the wells offsetting injection. “The 2019 development program represents $5.0 million of net capital expenditures and is expected to bring with it an exciting step change in production and cash flow for the company,” said Chayan Chakrabarty, Bengal’s President and CEO. “The program is a well balanced portfolio expected to significantly expand the Cuisinier platform supporting the Company’s growth beyond 2019.”</p>

</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Evi Drilling Exceeds Expectations</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As part of its light-oil Granite Wash drilling program, PPR recently drilled four exploration wells in its core Evi area. Two of the wells were successful, with an initial combined swab/flow test rate of about 300 bopd which exceeded management’s expectations. One of the wells is still being evaluated and one well was not successful. Average drill costs for the four Granite Wash wells came in under budget. The two successful Granite Wash wells are currently being tied-in, and are expected to be brought on production in early December.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To reduce rig moving costs, the Company will now begin drilling two lower-risk Slave Point light-oil development wells in Evi. The Slave Point wells are expected to be brought on production in the first quarter of 2019. With the capital costs spent on the Granite Wash drilling program and resulting successful test results, PPR reconfirms its 2018 capital budget of approximately $29 million and 2018 average production of 5,200 to 5,600 boe/d.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It isn’t just Alberta’s problem now.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The plummeting price of Canadian heavy crude oil has been a source of of rising anxiety in Calgary and misery for investors in the energy sector. But it is more than that. As the downturn deepens, it’s becoming a cause of worry for the entire domestic economy, and for government finances that haven’t fully recovered yet from the oil crash of 2014 to 2016.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The numbers are extraordinary. This week, the country’s heavy-oil benchmark, Western Canadian Select (WCS), fell to US$13.46 per barrel, lower than at any point during the oil recession of several years ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jim Gray, a veteran of Canada’s energy sector and chairman of the energy group at Brookfield Asset Management Inc., offers another eye-popping figure to describe the potential damage: By some calculations, total government revenue from royalties and taxable income related to heavy oil could fall by $10-billion. That works out to about $700 per Canadian household. But that’s only one fairly narrow measure of the costs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Canada’s economy is suffering in other ways, too, from a surplus of energy and a shortage of pipelines in which to ship it. Natural gas prices are weak, and conventional, non-heavy Canadian crude also sells at a price lower than West Texas Intermediate (WTI), the North American benchmark. On the other side of the country, East Coast refineries, unable to get Alberta oil, are relying upon imports of more expensive Brent crude from the North Sea. (Brent trades for about US$67 a barrel.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Add it all up, and toss in the spinoff effects of slower activity in other sectors of the economy, and the economic damage of oil’s drop runs well into the tens of billions of dollars. At 85, Mr. Gray has lived through decades of ups and downs in Canada’s energy sector, but he believes that the current downturn could prove particularly harmful if it persists.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“This is an urgent issue. I’ve never been more concerned,” said Mr. Gray, who co-founded <span class="companylink">Canadian Hunter Exploration Ltd</span>. in 1973 (it was acquired in 2001 by <span class="companylink">Burlington Resources Inc</span>., which is now owned by <span class="companylink">ConocoPhillips</span>).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He’s not alone. Alex Pourbaix, chief executive officer of Cenovus Energy Inc., warned this week that Alberta faces a “wholesale economic catastrophe.” And DBRS, the credit rating agency, declared that "Canada’s oil sector has become untethered from global oil market dynamics.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Part of the problem lies with the bearish moves in WTI, a U.S.-based benchmark that many observers cite when describing global oil prices. WTI traded at about US$57 a barrel on Friday, down 25 per cent since early October, amid a brewing trade war between China and the United States and fears of slowing global economic activity at a time when global energy production is robust.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the real frustration in Canada stems from the sharp decline in the price of WCS oil. Even after the heavy oil benchmark rebounded on Friday, to US$17.43 per barrel, it’s still down 70 per cent since the middle of May, and sells at a bizarre US$40-a-barrel discount to WTI.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Canadian heavy oil has always traded at a discount to WTI to account for the fact that it is both more expensive to transport to Gulf Coast refineries and to refine it into usable petroleum products. But the historical average over the past 10 years is between US$17 and US$18 a barrel. The massive spread that exists now, observers say, reflects Canada’s inability to get new pipelines approved, which is causing a buildup in oil inventories as new projects come on stream. According to <span class="companylink">RBC Dominion Securities</span>, producers are struggling to ship some 250,000 barrels of oil per day.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Gray isn’t the only observer trotting out gruesome numbers to describe the potential damage should these conditions linger. The <span class="companylink">Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers</span> estimated that the wider spread between WCS and WTI cost Canadian heavy oil producers about $50-million per day in lost revenue in October alone. Over a year, that would add up to $18-billion in lost revenue.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Looking toward the year ahead, <span class="companylink">Peters & Co. Ltd</span>., a Calgary-based investment company, estimated this week that a WCS discount of US$40 a barrel would cost Alberta $5-billion in lost royalties in 2019, or 10 per cent of the province’s budget – and that doesn’t include the financial impact of slower economic activity, such as lower income tax revenues.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists are starting to consider the broader potential damage that could affect all Canadians, though oil-producing regions will feel more pain than, say, regions that are net consumers of crude.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Do the latest energy market developments have Canada’s economy over a barrel?” Avery Shenfeld, chief economist at CIBC World Markets, said in a recent note. “For now, what’s clear is that the oil sector – responsible for Canada’s largest export product as well as up to a third of business capital spending in good times – will be reverting to a drag on growth forecasts in upcoming quarters.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The last time the price of oil fell this sharply, between 2014 and 2016, Alberta slipped into a recession that knocked 7.2 per cent from the province’s gross domestic product (GDP). The pain didn’t end at the provincial boundary, though.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Large Canadian banks set aside more than $420-million in 2015 to handle bad loans to struggling energy companies; the S&P/TSX Composite Index slumped 24 per cent, affecting anyone with investments tied to the Canadian stock market; the Canadian dollar plummeted 25 cents against the U.S. dollar in the space of two years, bottoming out at 68.6 U.S. cents in early 2016.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Canadian economic growth virtually stalled and sent the unemployment rate from 6.6 per cent in January, 2015, to 7.2 per cent within a year. The <span class="companylink">Bank of Canada</span> responded by cutting its key interest rate twice to keep the national economy from getting stuck.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists believe that a repeat of these dire conditions isn’t necessarily in the works. Canada’s oil patch is more efficient today than it was in 2015.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Given the operating break-even costs we’ve seen, we estimate that WTI would need to drop below US$50 per barrel on a sustained basis before Canadian output was significantly curtailed,” Stephen Brown, senior Canadian economist at Capital Economics, said in a note.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As well, railways are building their capacity to move the oil that can’t be handled by pipelines, easing some of the export bottlenecks. Last time, Canada’s energy sector was coming off a development boom, making the downturn particularly painful; today’s downturn follows a period of far more muted capital spending.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nonetheless, observers believe that the deteriorating energy market has emerged as the biggest headwind facing the Canadian economy, eclipsing the importance of recent bickering over trade tariffs and renegotiating the North American free-trade agreement.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Douglas Porter, chief economist at BMO Nesbitt Burns, said that the depressed price of Canadian oil could shave between 0.3 and 0.5 percentage points from Canadian GDP over the next year if current conditions persist – which isn’t great when the forecast for GDP growth in 2019 is just 2 per cent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The longer it goes it on, the deeper oil drops, the more intense the damage,” Mr. Porter said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The current price of Canadian oil is about half the price used by the <span class="companylink">Bank of Canada</span> to support its economic assumptions in its most recent monetary policy report, released in October. In other words, the central bank’s relatively upbeat assumptions used to support gradual interest rate hikes already appear to be way out of date.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What’s more, the current price of WCS is well below the price at which oil traded in 2015, when the <span class="companylink">Bank of Canada</span> cut its key interest rate in an attempt to shore up the country’s economic activity. In January, 2015, when the central bank cut its rate by a quarter of a percentage point, for example, WCS traded at about US$37 a barrel.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists expect that Bank of Canada governor Stephen Poloz, who has been relatively quiet about oil prices, will have to address the issue as the central bank contemplates hiking its key interest rate over the next couple of months. The bank has raised rates five times since July 2017 as it attempts to normalize monetary policy after nearly a decade of ultra-low rates, but may have to rethink its policy, at least in the short term.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“At the very least, I think the <span class="companylink">Bank of Canada</span> has to become more cautious. They have to respect the fact that we could be in a different environment for a longer period of time,” Mr. Porter said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Within the oil patch, observers are certainly bracing themselves for challenging times ahead.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“There is plenty of blame to go around here. But the point is that there is an enormous economic cost to all of this,” Mr. Gray said. “And it isn’t just Alberta that’s suffering, but the federal government and the other provinces, right down to the Maritimes.”</p>

</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As Canadian oil prices continue to deteriorate relative to world oil prices, Canada’s oil industry faces one of the most significant crises in decades.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Western Canadian Select (WCS), which is the benchmark price for diluted bitumen produced from the oil sands, traded for about US$13 a barrel on Nov. 15, some US$43 a barrel below West Texas Intermediate crude (WTI). In a balanced market, WCS would have sold for about US$42 a barrel.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prices for light sweet crude oil from conventional reservoirs and synthetic crude oil (SCO) from the oil sands also continued to fall, hitting prices below US$30 a barrel, a discount of US$30 a barrel relative to WTI when in a balance market the discount should be less than US$5.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Estimates put the lost revenues from these made-in-Canada price discounts in the range of $100-million a day. Think about that for a minute. That is $3-billion a month in lost revenue to Canada’s economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We are selling our oil, primarily to refiners in the United States, at a fraction of what it would be worth if we had adequate pipeline capacity to reach these markets. Many Canadian oil producers are not covering their production costs at these prices and as losses mount, they will respond by cutting their capital spending programs, their work forces and their production.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Governments that typically benefit from the corporate income taxes and royalties associated with oil production are facing much lower revenues at a time when they are already under pressure to cut spending to deal with large deficits.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A number of factors have led to the current distressed situation. Several large oil sands projects have been completed after years of construction, adding more than 500,000 barrels a day of production as they reached full capacity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This as several large U.S. refineries that normally process bitumen from the oil sands have been offline as they do maintenance, reducing demand by up to one million barrels a day. Court rulings delaying the construction of both the Trans Mountain Expansion and the Keystone XL pipeline have added to the negative sentiment. And storage in Alberta has filled up with few places left to physically put the oil.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Better pipeline access through the timely completion of the Trans Mountain Expansion and the Keystone XL pipeline are key to solving the problem. Governments need to improve the process for approvals to remove the uncertainty and delays that have been experienced.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But this will not help in the short term, as each of these pipelines is likely three years or more from completion. Increasing rail loading capacity is part of the solution, and it is expected that rail exports will grow from the recent level of 230,000 barrels a day to 400,000 barrels a day by next summer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The imminent start-up of bitumen processing at the Sturgeon Refinery in Edmonton will help to absorb 50,000 barrels a day, and the return to full operation of the U.S. refineries once their maintenance is completed will restore an important part of the market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But with storage so full and prices so low, it is unclear how long these changes will take to balance the market. Producers have begun to cut back their production, with announced reductions from seven producers of between 123,000 and 144,000 barrels a day according to a recent report from IHS Markit Insight.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Two paths forward are being proposed: have the Alberta government intervene in the market to reduce production by all producers in order to balance the market as quickly as possible; or let the market sort out the issue through further individual producer cutbacks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Both paths have significant risks, and the Alberta government is analyzing them and looking for other options. Whatever the response, great care must be taken to avoid doing more harm than good.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When companies ask governments to intervene in a market place, it is a good indication that there are very serious issues that need to be dealt with.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The cancellations and delays of the major export pipelines that have happened over the past few years are now delivering the body blow that many in the oil industry have been warning about, and the longer-term implications for our country from this crisis are also likely to be significant for investment and for jobs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Oil production in the United States grew by two million barrels a day in the past year, to reach more than 11 million barrels a day. Canada is losing vast amounts of revenue and shutting in its oil production while the rest of the world profits.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We need leadership to address the dysfunction of our situation so Canada can again be an attractive place to invest for one of our most important industries.</p>

(“Trinidad”) (TSX:TDG). At Precision’s election, the expiration of the waiting period now satisfies the required Competition Act condition under the arrangement agreement between Precision and Trinidad.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Precision’s President and CEO Kevin Neveu stated: “Successful termination of the waiting periods for both Canadian and U.S. competition acts marks a significant milestone in the regulatory review process for the Precision-Trinidad combination.

The Company has signed seven additional term contracts since that time with several other contracts pending and expected to be signed in the coming weeks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Canada, Precision’s activity has remained largely stable since our Q3/18 conference call with 54 rigs currently active. Quarter-to-date activity has tracked in line with Q4/17 despite recent market uncertainty.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Precision’s international operations remain stable with eight rigs currently active and an additional Kuwait new build rig deployment on track for mid-2019.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Highlights</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">* Tested a combined 3,840 Bopd of light (35-38 API) oil from individual tests in the Upper and Lower Bahariya formations in the South Ghazalat 6X exploration well</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">* Flowed 2,437 Bopd of light oil, 21 Bpd of water and 1.4 MMCFD of natural gas on a 40/64” choke from a 42 foot perforated interval in the Lower Bahariya</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">* Flowed 1,403 Bopd of light oil, 210 Bpd of water and 1.0 MMCFD of natural gas on a 64/64” choke from a 23 foot perforated interval in the Upper Bahariya OPERATIONS UPDATE</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">ARAB REPUBLIC OF EGYPT</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">South Ghazalat, Arab Republic of Egypt (100% working interest, operated)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Operations and Exploration</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As announced on November 8th, 2018, the Company drilled the SGZ 6X exploration well to a total depth of 5,195 feet and cased the well as a potential Bahariya light oil discovery. Subsequently, the Company tested three intervals in the Bahariya formation and tested a combined 3,840 barrels per day of light oil from the upper and lower Bahariya.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The lower Bahariya formation flowed naturally at an average rate of 2,437 barrels per day of light (38 API) oil, 21 barrels per day of water and 1.4 million cubic feet of natural gas per day on a 40/64 inch choke from a 42 foot perforated interval. A total of 918 barrels of oil and 7 barrels of water were produced during the 10 hour test.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The middle Bahariya produced a small amount of formation water using nitrogen to lift fluid to surface from an 8 foot perforated interval.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The upper Bahariya formation flowed at an average rate of 1,403 barrels per day of light (35 API) oil, 210 barrels per day of water and 1.0 million cubic feet of natural gas per day on a 64/64 inch choke from a 23 foot perforated interval. A total of 456 barrels of oil and 65 barrels of water were produced during the 8 hour test.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Based on the positive test rates from SGZ 6X, the Company will begin preparing a development plan for the discovery. In addition, the Company is integrating the SGZ 6X well results into the existing database and mapping to evaluate additional exploration/appraisal drilling in the area and to accelerate potential early development options.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With the completion of SGZ 6X well, the Company has met the financial commitments for the current exploration phase of the concession. The South Ghazalat concession was extended to May 6, 2019 with the option to enter into the final 18 month exploration phase. Although encouraging, test rates are not necessarily indicative of long-term performance or ultimate recovery.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Randy Neely, President of TransGlobe remarked “We are delighted that our perseverance in the Western Desert has been rewarded with a light oil discovery and very encouraging test rates. Once we have completed our planning we will be able to incorporate the development of this discovery into our 2019 plan, and provide updated capital and production guidance.”</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Oil and Gas Advisories</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Mr. Brett Norris, M.Sc., P <span class="companylink">Geo</span>, - Vice President Exploration for <span class="companylink">TransGlobe Energy Corporation</span>, and a qualified person as defined in the Guidance Note for Mining, Oil and Gas Companies, June 2009, of the <span class="companylink">London Stock Exchange</span>, has reviewed and approved the technical information contained in this announcement. Mr. Norris obtained a Master’s of Science Degree in Geology from the <span class="companylink">University of Western Ontario</span>. He is a Registered Professional Geoscientist in the province of Alberta and has over 30 years’ experience in oil and gas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">BOEs may be misleading, particularly if used in isolation. A BOE conversion ratio of six thousand cubic feet of natural gas to one barrel of oil equivalent (6 mcf: 1 bbl) is based on an energy equivalency conversion method primarily applicable at the burner tip and does not represent a value equivalency at the wellhead. Given that the value ratio based on the current price of crude oil as compared to natural gas is significantly different from the energy equivalency of 6:1, utilizing a conversion on a 6:1 basis may be misleading as an indication of value.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">References in this press release to production test rates, are useful in confirming the presence of hydrocarbons, however such rates are not determinative of the rates at which such wells will commence production and decline thereafter and are not indicative of long term performance or of ultimate recovery. While encouraging, readers are cautioned not to place reliance on such rates in calculating the aggregate production for TransGlobe. A pressure transient analysis or well-test interpretation has not been carried out in respect of all wells. Accordingly, the Company cautions that the production test results should be considered to be preliminary.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Any nation that engages in diplomacy does so with more than a touch of hypocrisy, and that includes Canada. Take the current state of Canadian-Saudi relations as one example.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Back in early August, Global Affairs Canada tweeted a statement urging Saudi Arabia to release Samar Badawi, a human-rights activist imprisoned in Saudi Arabia (also sister to Raif Badawi, whose wife and three children are Canadian citizens) and the Saudis threw a diplomatic fit.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They declared the Canadian position "a grave and unacceptable violation of the Kingdom's laws and procedures," threw out the Canadian ambassador and suspended all new trade between Canada and Saudi Arabia. They cut direct air service between the two countries and ordered all Saudi students in Canada to come home (they have partially rescinded this last action).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The arrest of Badawi was just the latest of a long line of humanrights abuses from a country that seems to specialize in such abuses. As of this writing there are 12 Shiite dissidents in Saudi Arabia who are in grave danger of execution because they participated in Shiite protests in the Kingdom in 2016.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Add to this Saudi Arabia's current war on the Houthi rebel movement in Yemen. The Houthis are Shiites and, according to the Saudis, acting as proxies of Iran, Saudi Arabia's chief rival in the region. The Saudi bombing campaign in Yemen has killed countless civilians and is being waged with religious ferocity. Sure, the Houthis are attacking the Saudis with all means available, but the damage is far from proportional.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On top of all this is the murder of American resident and journalist Jamal Khashoggi in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul, clearly a political hit ordered by the highest levels of the government in Riyadh.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Canada is tied up in all this in two ways. First we import about 75,000 to 80,000 barrels of Saudi oil every day, about 10 per cent of our needs. And second, we are apparently locked into an agreement made by the Harper Conservatives and agreed to by the Trudeau Liberals to sell 900 Canadian-built armoured vehicles to Saudi Arabia.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To say that Canada is unhappy with Saudi Arabia would be an understatement. And yet Canada continues to pursue trade agreements, and specifically a wideranging free trade agreement, with China, which makes Saudi Arabia look like a protector of human rights by comparison.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">China's record on human rights has long been absolutely deplorable, both in individual cases of imprisonment of dissidents and in the current campaign to completely suppress the Muslim Uighur minority of Xinjiang Autonomous Region in northwest China. The <span class="companylink">U.S. Congress</span> is now pressing President Trump to react strongly to this campaign and is even threatening sanctions because of it, while Canada presses for better relations with China and more robust trade.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So what is going on here? Our government is pursuing what it sees as a Canadian national interest in broadening out Canadian trade with nations other than the United States while ensuring that the trickle of oil we import from Saudi Arabia continues to flow because environmental activists have shut down any possibility that we could replace Saudi oil with oil from Alberta via the now defunct Energy East pipeline.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hypocrisy can be defined in many ways, but if Canada truly cared about human rights abroad, we would publicly remonstrate against China as we did with Saudi Arabia. But we don't, because China is the world's second largest economy and, in the minds of some dreamers in Ottawa and elsewhere, a possible replacement, at least in part, for the trade we do with the United States, especially in the age of Donald Trump.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is wishful thinking, of course.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Canadian and American economies have been merging since the 1840s and will continue to do so far into the future. Not because of any <span class="companylink">NAFTA</span>, or USMCA, as Donald Trump has dubbed <span class="companylink">NAFTA</span> 2.0, but because of proximity and the complementarity of what we and they do. Modern technologies and advancements in bulk transportation will only cement the two economies even more. So although we may improve our economic position via a broad trade deal with China, we will remain closely tied to the United States as long as both countries exist.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Our relationships with Saudi Arabia and China are only the most glaring examples of Canadian hypocrisy in international relations. There are others. But since Canadian governments have long pretended that Canada stands on a unique moral high ground in international relations, Canadians themselves have long believed that myth.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Just over a month ago, Canadians were given the right to purchase dried and fresh cannabis and unconcentrated forms of cannabis oil.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is likely to be another year before concentrates will be legalized.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"What's going to happen — and this is just my prediction — is that people are going to do a butane hash extraction at home and they're going to blow themselves up," said Sgt. Guy Pilon, clandestine lab co-ordinator with the Edmonton Police Service.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We've had a number of those in the recent past. People blow themselves up trying to make this weed oil."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pilon said before cannabis was legalized, Edmonton police dealt with six butane hash oil labs. He expects many Canadians might want to experiment and attempt to make their own with the pot that they can now purchase at a store.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's butane honey oil, so it's not hash. It's a weed oil. It's a golden- coloured syrup and from that they can take it and create shatter which is a really potent concentrate."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sometimes described as the "crack of marijuana," shatter is a hash oil concentrate made by using butane to extract resin with high concentrations of THC from a marijuana plant. The name refers to the end product which looks like a sheet of toffee.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A small amount of the drug is dabbed on a heated surface and inhaled or smoked in a pipe.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Because butane is used, a simple spark can create an explosion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"With the regulation of cannabis and the decriminalization of it, one aspect that we need to focus on is public education," said Calgary police Insp. Kevin Forsen with the community support section.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"People can go onto the internet and read how to do it. Nobody's going to post how dangerous it is or very few people are going to do it."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Forsen points out that people messing around with butane at home put not only themselves at risk but others living nearby.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Those are extremely dangerous processes and there is that risk," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"When you look at shatter, the amount of THC that's in it can run up to between 90 and 95 per cent, so it's very highly concentrated and that might be something the illicit market would want to capitalize on right now."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Alberta's justice minister hadn't heard about police concerns, but said they appear legitimate and she is willing to discuss the possibility of more education.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Kathleen Ganley said the government has a plan in place but knew there would be bumps along the road once cannabis became legal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There was always an expectation that was going to have to fluctuate somewhat to deal with unforeseen circumstances," she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"This is the first time since Prohibition on alcohol was lifted that we've dealt with something that's a legalization of this scale, so I expect that we will have to respond to those issues."</p>

After a resounding 'No' to the Olympics, Calgarians wonder where the city goes from here[https://www.thestar.com/calgary/2018/11/14/after-a-resounding-no-to-the-olympics-calgarians-wonder-where-the-city-goes-from-here.html]
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And, so, when the votes came in, the opinions of those city leaders proved not to match those of Calgarians.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Residents voted no.[https://www.thestar.com/calgary/2018/11/13/calgarians-reject-2026-olympic-bid-in-citywide-plebiscite.html] It was likely the right decision — everyone knows that the Olympics, often promoted as a city- and nation-building exercise, are little more than an overpriced circus that almost always leaves its host cities burdened with debt for generations and infrastructure that not only goes unused but falls into disrepair as well.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet another example, in a litany of examples, of Canadian voters going against the wishes of elites.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Doug Ford's election was much in the same vein. Though pundits and Ontario's elites were aghast at the thought of <span class="companylink">Ford</span> winning government, he did win — and handily.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">Ford</span>'s approach, and his down-to-earth manner of speaking were seen by some as not fitting of a premier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But he was relentlessly focused not on grandiose policies but on the issues that matter to voters. Some may roll their eyes at buck-a-beer pricing, or at cutting the gas tax, but they're issues that are tangible to voters.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Similar campaigns have found success across the country — Quebec, New Brunswick, and most likely Alberta before too long, are opting for the things that affect them, not big-thinking policies that feel remote and pinch their wallets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That is going to continue to define Canadian politics for the next while.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Our leaders — civic, business and political — continue to be obsessed with big-picture ideas, and nation-building policies. Climate change battles. Transforming our electoral systems. Being an international leader on refugees.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">All are ideas that have been pushed in recent years by those leaders. All are ideas that are celebrated as important exercises in building Canada, both here at home and as an international brand.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many of these ideas appeal to me. Like many, I have committed much of my life to making Canada a better place; to projects that help foster social cohesion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the evidence suggests big-picture thinking, which the elites continue to put on offer, is not what Canadians want to buy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Our society has turned inwards. Self-care is no longer just a buzzword — it's a way of living. Our social circles are smaller. Our thoughts unchallenged by ideological opponents. Our lives organized to avoid unwanted interaction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This isolation means that many Canadians are feeling more self-interested than ever.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Let me give you an example. Polling overwhelmingly shows that Canadians believe in climate change, and that something must be done.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But polling also shows that the “something” had better not affect them. If it costs them money that they would otherwise use to pay their bills or lengthens their commute and keeps them away from their families, for instance, that support quickly evaporates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For today's political leaders it does seem to be a new world; a world where it has been repeatedly shown that the focus needs to be on the little guy and not on big ideas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For better or for worse, it is an adjustment that any successful political leader will need to come to terms with.</p>

The most straightforward solution is new pipelines, but the death of Northern Gateway and Energy East, and the legal setbacks for Trans Mountain and Keystone XL, have bred impatience.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Several oil companies have come up with an alternative, asking the Alberta government to restrict production in an effort to drive up prices[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/business/article-call-for-crude-production-quotas-splits-oil-patch/] . The proposal has caused a sharp divide within the industry and underscored the frustration that the province has so far been unable to turn its oil and gas sector around.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The proposal is being floated by <span class="companylink">Cenovus Energy Inc</span>., <span class="companylink">Canadian Natural Resources Ltd</span>. and <span class="companylink">MEG Energy Corp</span>., with Cenovus chief executive Alex Pourbaix arguing the intervention is needed because a massive market failure is hurting not only oil companies but government revenues and the broader economy. However, companies such as <span class="companylink">Suncor Energy Inc</span>. and <span class="companylink">Husky Energy Inc</span>. – whose refining operations benefit from low prices – oppose intervention, saying it would risk triggering retaliation from the United States.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Western Canadian Select fell below US$14 a barrel this past week, well below the US$56 price for New York-traded West Texas Intermediate. The Alberta government has said a US$40 differential costs the province $40-million in lost revenue every day.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Alberta Premier Rachel Notley hasn’t weighed in on the idea, saying only that the province is studying its options and expects to announce measures to protect the industry in the coming weeks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Persistently lower oil prices, and the damage they have done to the economy, have cast a shadow over every facet of the province and were almost certainly a factor in the demise of Calgary’s 2026 bid on Tuesday. Calgarians voted 56 per cent against hosting the $5-billion Winter Games amid fears of cost overruns that would only further damage the city and the province.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Calgary Mayor Naheed Nenshi, who was a vocal supporter of the bid, says the city still needs projects connected to the bid[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/canada/alberta/article-olympic-bids-demise-creates-roadblock-for-calgarys-infrastructure/] such as a new field house and affordable housing, which means finding a way to replace $2-billion in funding from the provincial and federal governments.

The mayors have agreed they will look at Surrey’s latest proposal, though that step falls short of an endorsement of the plan.</p>

The essence of the system is to limit production amounts in a pro-rata form, resulting in less production – a large reduction of economic waste – but leading, obviously, to higher prices.”</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We are saddened to announce that our dear mother, Beverley, died peacefully at home in Toronto on November 13, 2018.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Born in Ottawa, Beverley was the youngest daughter of Leon and Beckie Petegorsky; sister to the late Jeanette Pelcovits, Ethel Geffen, and Dr. David W. Petegorsky. In 1951, Beverley married Marvin Chodikoff of Troy, NY. They had 14 wonderful years together until Marvin's early death due to cancer in 1965.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With three young sons at that time, Beverley entered the workforce, completing the Canadian Securities Course and joining an Ottawa investment firm. She was also active in overseeing the management of her late father's real estate holdings, and remained an Ottawa resident until her move to Toronto in 2007.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Beverley was a lover of the arts. Her passions were music, theatre, classic films, and mystery novels. She also enjoyed playing bridge with her friends. Beverley will always be remembered for her kindness and compassion toward others. She valued family and the relationship she had with her sons as well as with her late sisters, brother, parents, and close relatives. She was a loyal friend to many.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Beverley is survived by her sons, Mark, Richard, and David (Tanya); and grandson, Daniel. In keeping with Beverley's wishes, there was no funeral service: interred next to Marvin, at the Ottawa Jewish Memorial Gardens Cemetery on November 15.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The family wishes to thank the physicians, nurses, support workers, and the staff and management at the Hazelton Place Retirement Residence for the excellent care and attention she received.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For 65 years, Hub was married to the love of his life, Pam (nee Cowie), and was an inspiring dad to sons Char, Chris, Randy and Tim; a caring father-in-law to Jenny, Carola, Claudia and Leslie; and charismatic grandfather to his 12 grandchildren and favorite uncle to nieces, Grania and Erica.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Thanks to his booming baritone voice, commanding presence and indomitable spirit, Hub influenced everyone around him, living life with passion, conviction and a fierce independence, combining his thirst for adventure with curiosity about the unknown.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He was an honored Korean War veteran, successful businessman, keen photographer, lover of books, an orator, author, historian, mountain hiking enthusiast and avid collector of art and antiques. As a spiritual seeker he helped introduce Transcendental Meditation to Canada in the early 1960's with his sister, Eileen, and motivated many others to explore their deeper purpose through his lectures and writings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At age 22, Hub enlisted with the 2nd Battalion of Princess Patricia's Canadian Light Infantry, fighting with courage and distinction in the pivotal battle of Kapyong.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the early 1970's Hub opened and managed the company's office in London, England and the Middle East. Returning to Calgary he later formed his own oil and gas exploration firm.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In retirement, Hub served on numerous boards including the <span class="companylink">Glenbow Museum</span> and continued to enjoy hiking, photography and holidays on the west coast with Pam. He became a frequent interviewee on national radio and television, speaking about military history and championing the cause of veterans and the PPCLI.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">JUNE ORD (Margaret Rosemary) (nee Scott)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On November 12, 2018, peacefully in Elora with family. Beloved wife of the late Judge John Ord. Loved by sons, Robin and wife, Denise, Clive and wife, Annie, and Roger and wife, Kris; grandma to Scott, Mike, Ryan, Ali and Hayden; and great-grandma to Isabella and Aria.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">June was raised on a farm in Shropshire. Her mother Maude, from a musical Welsh family of Roberts, married Wynne Scott on his return from WW1. June grew up working and playing on the farm, often with cousin Mike Scott, then attended Moreton Hall school until mid-WWII, when she became a volunteer at Rednal aerodrome.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There she met her husband John, a young Spitfire pilot.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Showing strength of character, June eloped! She travelled alone to New York and on to 1946 Toronto, where relatives insisted they wed in record time. John was so smitten he never looked back, riding June's wings to a BA, to Osgoode, to a QC and to a Judgeship.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">From entertaining in 1960s Georgetown to joining with friends Maria, Brookie and Marjory Nazer in their quest for artistic expression during the 1970s and 1980s, June split her time between “home improvements" and a ramshackle but much-loved cottage on Lake Rosseau.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">June and John eventually abandoned entertaining in favour of close friends and family visits, moving to Bracebridge and finally to Elora, celebrating their loving union well past their diamond jubilee. After John's 2012 death June soldiered on, visiting cousin Mike on the Isle of Man and kin in New Zealand well into her 90s.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We will miss her steadfast support and enduring love. Her spirit never faltered. At the end, on being asked if she was ok, replied: “Not terribly". Thanks Mum.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">PAUL PATTERSON</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">November 29, 1931 November 11, 2018 Paul Roden Atherley Patterson had an outstanding career in the graphic arts business in Toronto.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">His creative genius carried over to his sense of style, and how he was always perfectly turned out.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Paul was born in Port Credit, just to the west of Toronto and grew up on Glen Road in Rosedale.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He started work as an apprentice in the graphic arts business and became a master, designing everything from ads to annual reports. Paul was generous and great company, with a tremendous sense of humour and love of life. He loved animals, his beloved cat Glenda and his horse Mad Margaret.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Paul is survived by his brother, Neil (and wife Ippy); his wife, Mollie; and his children, Kathy, Carol and Susan; as well as his longtime friend and colleague, Pamela Lypka.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">DR. HARRY ROSEN</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After a long, wonderfully well-lived life, Harry passed away peacefully at aged 89 on November 15, 2018.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Cherished husband of Delores (nee Corenblum) for 62 years, their loving union set the standard high for what a marriage can be. Adored father of Joy (Larry Freedman), Paula (Stephen Toope) and Eric (Rachel Nelson); grandfather of Erin, Michaela and Evan Freedman, Hannah (Peter Ellix), Alex and Rachel Toope, Max, Noah and Zoe Rosen. Great grandfather of Clara Ellix. Brother of Sarah Kagan and the late Irving Rosen.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">His St. Urbain Street childhood was modest in means but rich in love.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An outstanding student, he was admitted to the McGill Faculty of Dentistry before even completing his B.Sc. Thus began a relationship with the institution that would flourish through his lifetime, eventually becoming Emeritus Professor, all the while building a formidable private practice.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He was a pioneer in prosthodontics, published many ground-breaking journal articles, lectured regularly in Canada and abroad, and initiated the first Canadian graduate program in his specialty. He was a Fellow of the American College of Dentists, which bestowed upon him its greatest honour, the William John Gies Award.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Harry was a true Renaissance man.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An avid skier, dancer, windsurfer and equestrian, he was happiest when others would join him on the slopes, the dance floor, or in the lake, ring or woods.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">His greatest diversion was his work with stones, a material even more enduring than teeth. A practical exercise to clear rocks from the lake at his beloved country house in the Laurentians turned into a passion for building towering stone sculptures. Harry donated his collection of “earth art" pieces, unified by their inspirational and uplifting universal messages, to institutions whose mandates aligned with his passions. Now, 18 major works in Montreal and Toronto create a legacy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Few of his professional or personal accomplishments would have been possible without the foundation and support of Delores. Complementing each other perfectly, they were the greatest of dance partners, literally and figuratively, enjoying a rich social life, the arts and exploring the world.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Harry was immensely proud of his children, the lives they have built, and his grandchildren.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">His even temperament, warm smile and gentle charisma put anyone in his midst at ease.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Harry never lost his desire to keep learning and bettering himself.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Anyone who spent time with him would quickly realize they were in the presence of a happy, fullyrealized man, comfortable in his skin, and at peace with the world around him.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Productive to the end, even as his health was failing and he knew the clock was relentlessly ticking down, Harry knew only one direction: forward.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He will always be missed and never forgotten.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Roy was born in Dublin, Ireland, in 1924 after which he lived in Wales, Scotland and the U.S. before settling in Edmonton, Alberta. Following his father's footsteps, he embarked on what was one of the most gratifying aspects of his life, his long career in Internal Medicine. He received a Fulbright Fellowship and spent cherished time at <span class="companylink">Boston University</span> before starting his own practice in Edmonton in 1955. Roy appreciated the congenial and supportive atmosphere of the Edmonton General Hospital where he advocated for medical education and was at the forefront of cardiac care during a time of rapid innovation in the field.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">LINDA CLARKSON STEVENS</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">1951 - 2018 Lin Stevens, as described by friends, was bright, vivacious, articulate, committed to the causes she embraced, and beautiful. She died too young, at 67, of a sudden, unexpected heart attack at her home in Cambridge, Ont. on November 6, 2018. An ardent feminist and dedicated advocate for the environment, she loved books, newspapers, <span class="companylink">CBC Radio</span>, music, travel, cooking, gardening and dogs of all sizes and breeds. She spent many happy years in the Beach in Toronto, a wonderful mother raising her young children, entertaining friends, kayaking on the lake and strolling on the boardwalk.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A marketing graduate of what is now <span class="companylink">Ryerson University</span>, Lin was part of the wave of ambitious young professional women that emerged in Toronto in the 1970s. An active member of 21 McGill, the downtown club for professional women, she worked for City Woman magazine as long as it lasted and later at Michael de Pencier's Key Publishers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 15 years in Cambridge, she threw herself into environmental challenges - to protect the Gilholm Marsh from developers and to stop the relentless encroachment of gravel pits on residential areas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A woman of strong opinion, she despised politicians who are too blind, or too compromised, to recognize that global warming is destroying the planet we will leave our children and grandchildren.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lin leaves a devastated family: her parents, Nancy and Doug Clarkson of Brampton; her husband and partner of 34 years, journalist Geoffrey Stevens; her daughter Casey and son Jamie at home in Cambridge; and her stepchildren in Toronto, Alexandra Stevens (Michael Garrels) and Sean Stevens (Sarah). She is also survived by her sisters Jane Gilmour (William) of Brampton and Valerie Robinson (William) of Jacksonville, Fla, and her brother Robert Clarkson (Angela DiCintio) of Oakville.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A celebration of Lin's life will be held in Cambridge in the near future. Please email: rememberinglinstevens@ gmail.com. As much as she loved flowers, she would have appreciated donations to the <span class="companylink">David Suzuki Foundation</span> or the Heart and Stroke Foundation (Cambridge Chapter), for which she was a canvasser.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Michael George Welsman died unexpectedly on Tuesday, November 13, 2018, at home.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mike was born in Toronto in 1961, a son of the late George and Margo Welsman. He leaves his wife, Helen Flisar; and her children, Andria, Erika and Michela; his brothers, John (Cherie) and Paul (Sandra); his sister, Carol (Pat); as well as his nephews, James and Andrew, and his nieces, Amy (Alex) and Sophie (Mack).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They will all miss him beyond words and remember him always for his steadfast loyalty to family and friends, his music, his humour and his soulfulness.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mike was a gifted mimic, who applied no limits to his array of subjects. He would target family, friends, politicians, members of his community, dogs and, recently, the relentless sounds of hospital equipment. He was so good that, if you closed your eyes, you could visualize right there in the room a particular person, the Prime Minister, David Suzuki, the handyman, Lucy the Yorkshire Terrier. He loved to make people laugh.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mike loved to paint, and he also applied no limits to his canvases.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He painted driftwood, rocks, paddles and pictures, usually drawing inspiration from his favourite landscape, Muskoka.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Most of all, Mike loved to play music. With his musical friends, his band of brothers, and his sister, he gave joy to so many.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Music was his fuel. He had a remarkable ear and could perform almost any song, sometimes in the perfectly cadenced voice of the original artist.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mike's devotion to family was expressed in many ways, but perhaps most touchingly in the care he gave to his mother, Margo, and his regular visits, sometimes with his guitar in hand, to the Dunfield retirement residence where she lived. He was a devout man and full of kindness.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mike had many, many lifelong friendships, forged around campfires and out fishing. He loved the natural world and was passionate about its preservation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He made new friends everywhere, from residents of the Dunfield to staff at North York General and the Princess Margaret Hospital.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Three months ago, Michael and his beloved Helen were married, affirming their love and devotion of 13 years together. There was music and laughter - the things they treasured most. The family is comforted by the memories of him on that joyful day.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mike would want us to thank Dr.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Silverman and all the wonderful nurses and staff at both North York General Hospital and Princess Margaret Hospital.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A visitation was held at Thompson Funeral Home, 530 Industrial Parkway South, Aurora, on Friday, November 16th between 6 and 9 p.m. A Mass of Christian Burial will be held Saturday, November 17, at 10 a.m., at St. Michael's Cathedral Basilica, 65 Bond St., Toronto.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">INSIDE THE MARKET</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That hissing sound you hear is the air going out of the global growth story.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This week, Germany announced its economy unexpectedly contracted in the third quarter. Japan also reported its economy shrank during the July-to-September period.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, Britain stumbled even deeper into its self-imposed Brexit nightmare, Italy continued its budgetary stare-down with the <span class="companylink">European Union</span> and China reported disappointing growth in retail sales as its trade spat with the United States showed no signs of easing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On a brighter note, the United States and Canada continue to expand at a healthy clip. However, both countries face their own issues. The U.S. economy is widely expected to gear down next year as the stimulus from Washington's tax cuts begins to fade. Canada must deal with a cooling housing market and recessionlevel prices for Alberta oil.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For investors, this is – cue the understatement alert – a daunting time. The core of the problem is that global growth is slowing and that the biggest challenges ahead are more political than financial. There is no reliable way to predict what will happen next.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Money managers typically rely on mean reversion – the notion that no matter how crazy markets may appear right now, they inevitably come back into line with fundamentals. However, there is no similar assurance when it comes to U.S.-China trade, the politics of oil pipelines or the euro zone's future. This is, after all, an age dominated by Donald Trump, autocratic Chinese and Saudi leaders, shambolic Brexiters and fragile Italian political coalitions. The course of events from here will hinge on egos and national sensitivities and could easily lurch even further into chaos.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Stock markets around the world reflect the growing tension.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While Canadian investors obsess over the pain close to home, the misery in recent months has been a truly international affair. In fact, stacked up against the carnage in Chinese stocks (down 20.7 per cent since the start of the year in Canadian dollar terms) or the injuries sustained by big European shares (down 9.7 per cent), the damage to Toronto's S&P/TSX Composite (down 6.5 per cent) has been relatively minor.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite their recent angst, U.S.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">stocks have actually performed well, with a 7.2-per-cent gain since January. Still, if there is one overarching message to the year so far, it's that reality isn't living up to what investors had expected only a few months ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Charlie Bilello, director of research at Pension Partners, a New York money manager, published a table this week that showed how much stocks in each of the <span class="companylink">Group of 20</span> countries have fallen from their highest points in the past 52 weeks. The declines range from 7.4 per cent for the United States to 47.7 per cent for Turkey.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">(All returns calculated in U.S. dollars.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some other respected voices are also sounding dour. Simona Gambarini of <span class="companylink">Capital Economics</span> says the S&P 500 Index of big U.S.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">stocks will fall by 14 per cent in 2019 “and we don't think that equities in the euro zone will generally do much better." Didier SaintGeorges, a managing director at European money manager Carmignac Gestion, told a Reuters investment conference this week that investors should stock up on U.S. dollars and defensive stocks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet, for all the prevailing gloom, there are reasons for hope.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The single biggest reason for optimism is that stocks outside of the United States do not appear obviously overvalued. In Europe and Asia, shares are typically trading for 14 times or less estimates of next year's earnings. In Canada, they're only slightly more expensive. This is in line, or even a bit below, historical norms.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If earnings don't falter, stocks are a good deal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another positive sign is that central banks are likely to be cautious in raising rates. Policy-makers don't want to topple their economies into recession, and given the political uncertainties, they have strong motivation to take rate hikes slowly.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">Capital Economics</span> predicts the <span class="companylink">U.S. Federal Reserve</span>, the world's most important central bank, will stop hiking rates in mid-2019 in response to slowing growth. Similarly, the <span class="companylink">Bank of Canada</span> is likely to temper its rate-rise resolve given the difficulties faced by the Alberta oil patch. Continued low rates would help stocks since they would keep a lid on companies' borrowing costs and ensure that stock dividends still look attractive to investors when stacked up against bond yields.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On top of that, the recent spate of downbeat economic news could go into reverse. In Japan, for instance, the third-quarter downturn was in large part the result of floods in the western part of the country and an earthquake in Hokkaido. Barring a fresh outbreak of natural disasters, growth should flicker back to life in the fourth quarter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Similarly, Germany's surprise economic contraction in the latest quarter – its first shrinkage since 2015 – owed a lot to German automakers' difficulty in proving they can meet new emission standards that came into effect on Sept. 1. The enormous backlog of unsold vehicles that resulted from the regulatory shift should ease in coming months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What should Canadian investors do? You can start by making sure you're comfortable with the level of risk in your portfolio. If a 15-per-cent decline in the stock market over the next year would seriously damage your life, consider pruning some of your more daring bets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Vigilance is also in order. Keep an eye on the Italian 10-year bond yield, a good measure of the political stresses in the euro zone. And watch the CSI 300 index, which tracks Chinese stocks and offers a sense of how the China-U.S. trade conflict is proceeding. Both indicators are signalling high levels of concern, but have stabilized in recent weeks. That, at least, offers hope that next year will offer better returns than this one so far.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A long a rugged shoreline in Northern British Columbia, Canada's global energy ambitions are taking a longawaited step forward.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the head of the Douglas Channel, an inlet lined with rolling coastal mountains, workers are busy developing the expansive $18-billion LNG Canada export terminal, which will launch tankers full of liquefied natural gas to energy-hungry markets abroad. The ships will navigate pristine inland waterways before reaching the open Pacific Ocean and setting sail for Asia.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On a recent fall day at nearby Kitamaat Village, the main community and seat of government of the Haisla Nation, killer whales glide through the channel. For the revered sea mammals, the waterway is a hunting ground rich in marine life. For the Haisla, it's a source of everything from halibut and cod to prawn and crab.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's the same area where, only a few years ago, the Haisla helped put a stop to another massive energy project, <span class="companylink">Enbridge Inc</span>.'s Northern Gateway pipeline. <span class="companylink">Enbridge</span> was planning to send bitumen from Alberta's oil sands across British Columbia to a terminal near Kitimat before shipping it overseas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Northern Gateway was widely despised by local residents and many others in the province and was officially killed by the federal government in 2016.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In fact, one by one, projects designed to bring Canada's energy riches to global markets have failed or become entangled in a mess of politics and popular opposition. After Northern Gateway, <span class="companylink">TransCanada Corp</span>. gave up on its Energy East oil pipeline, and the company's Keystone XL project is mired in its 11th year of political and regulatory muck. The Trans Mountain pipeline expansion ran into so much resistance from environmentalists, First Nations and B.C. politicians that the federal government, desperate to keep the project alive, spent $4.5-billion this year to take over both the existing Trans Mountain pipeline and the expansion – a twinning of the original – from <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan Canada Ltd</span>., which had grown weary after years of opposition and delays.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the LNG Canada project is a different story. Instead of facing grinding opposition, the project has been embraced by politicians, regulators and, crucially, the Haisla and other First Nations in the Kitimat area and along the pipeline route.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lawns around Kitimat and Kitamaat Village are dotted with “We Want LNG Canada" signs and people in the area eagerly speak of the promised economic benefits of the project.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even among other liquefied natural-gas projects, which are generally seen as safer and less environmentally risky than oil pipelines, LNG Canada is a standout. In mid-2013, there were more than 20 LNG proposals in the province. Today, only LNG Canada, an international consortium led by global energy giant <span class="companylink">Royal Dutch Shell PLC</span>, and three other projects remain active. Pacific NorthWest LNG, led by Malaysia's state-owned Petronas, gave up on its own project amid various environmental and business issues and acquired a stake in LNG Canada this year; other participants in the venture include <span class="companylink">PetroChina</span>, Japan's <span class="companylink">Mitsubishi Corp</span>. and South Korea's <span class="companylink">Kogas</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The megaproject, which includes the Kitimat terminal, an accompanying pipeline, related infrastructure and producers drilling in northeastern British Columbia, is projected to cost as much as $40-billion for the first phase, which <span class="companylink">Shell</span> and the four co-owners approved last month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">How did LNG Canada do it? How did the project achieve a breakthrough after years of failed or stalled energy proposals?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Winning the support of the Haisla and others took years of careful planning and relationship-building by a corporate entity that had the benefit of being able to study the previous, flawed attempts of others.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">LNG Canada officials were aware of the tense relations that developed between Enbridge and local residents over the Northern Gateway project. In a 2012 letter to the <span class="companylink">National Energy Board</span>, Joanne Monaghan, then the mayor of Kitimat, said the Haisla found Enbridge's consultations with First Nations to be “brash and insincere." Kitimat residents would later vote 58.4 per cent against the project in a non-binding plebiscite.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the fall of 2012, then-Haisla Nation chief councillor Ellis Ross outlined his blueprint for a make-or-break set of negotiations with backers of LNG Canada. The Haisla were skeptical that the conglomerate would negotiate in good faith. Inside the community's office in Kitamaat Village, Mr. Ross presented his vision for being taken seriously at the table. “I wanted legally binding commercial agreements and strong commitments with definitive numbers," he recalled.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the fall of 2013, LNG Canada head Andy Calitz, who had become the project's top executive only a few months earlier, approached Mr. Ross at a business conference in Vancouver. Mr. Calitz, a <span class="companylink">Shell</span> veteran known for his ability to close deals, shook hands with the Haisla leader and made a pledge.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Andy Calitz made an impression and told me, ‘I understand and I'm here just to tell you that we're going to do things differently and put things together. That's my promise to you: to do things better.' He committed to sitting down with us," Mr. Ross said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Calitz said he encourages his staff, notably Indigenous relations manager Mike Eddy and his team, to listen carefully and discuss the potential economic benefits of the project.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We are sensitive to justice and equity in First Nations matters," Mr. Calitz said as he looked out over the forested area where the export terminal will be assembled over the next six years with massive modules imported from China.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He and director of external affairs Susannah Pierce have been working on the project for more than five years. “We don't want First Nations to be surprised," said Ms. Pierce, seated at a picnic table on the site. “It's about trust and it's not a cookie-cutter approach. It's a collaborative, listening-type of engagement."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Everyone concedes the talks got off to a rocky start.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“But to their credit, they fixed it. It was different than dealing with Enbridge," said Mr. Ross, who stepped down as chief councillor two years ago and was elected to the B.C. Legislature in last year's provincial election.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">LNG Canada has been working closely not only with the Haisla but with six other Indigenous communities along the shipping route: the Kitselas, Gitxaala, Kitsumkalum, Gitga'at, Lax Kw'alaams and Metlakatla.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Joe Bevan, the elected chief councillor of Kitselas First Nation, said the company earned his community's trust by showing respect for his group's rights and title after a series of meetings in 2014.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“At first they said, ‘What are we buying here?' But we said, "No, you can't buy our rights. They're constitutionally protected.' We told them that what they're buying is an Indigenous social licence," Mr. Bevan said. “After a few sessions together, they eventually understood and we worked together."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Clifford White, the elected chief councillor and a hereditary leader of the Gitxaala Nation, said he appreciated that Mr. Calitz and Ms. Pierce presented a unified message of respecting Indigenous rights and title and didn't try to play games. “Andy and Susannah were pretty much joined at the hip," Mr. White said. “They worked well together and they listened to our concerns about the tanker traffic, because as you go down the channel, it crosses into our territory."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A key part of the discussions was ensuring minimal impact on fish and habitat along the Douglas Channel. Officials agreed to operate ships at reduced speeds and have them escorted by specially built tugboats. Indigenous groups negotiated a site for the disposal of material from dredging the waters near the wharf. And project officials agreed to elevate a pipeline in Kitimat to avoid disrupting the movements of grizzly bears and moose.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of course, talks also focused on money and economic benefits. LNG Canada estimates it will be providing $100-million in contracting opportunities to Indigenous businesses during the construction of the terminal. It also forecasts billions of dollars in economic benefits for 25 Indigenous groups in the form of training, employment and payments to bands during the project's 40-year life. (The B.C. government estimates that LNG Canada has spent $60-million on agreements with Indigenous groups, but company officials declined to discuss any direct payments to First Nations.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The project's accompanying pipeline operation also won support by offering benefits to those communities. <span class="companylink">TransCanada</span> has been tapped to build the $6.2billion, 670-kilometre Coastal GasLink pipeline, which will transport natural gas from the North Montney region in northeastern British Columbia to the terminal site in Kitimat. The pipeline has been approved by all 20 bands along the route and <span class="companylink">TransCanada</span> has conditionally awarded $620-million in contracts to Indigenous businesses in the region.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Karen Ogen-Toews, the former elected chief councillor of the Wet'suwet'en, founded the First Nations LNG Alliance three years ago to give Indigenous leaders greater clout in discussions with industry executives. “LNG Canada has been very inclusive, even with First Nations that</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">don't have direct agreements with them," she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For almost two decades, both the B.C. NDP and Liberals have dreamt about exploiting the vast natural-gas fields in northeastern British Columbia. Former Liberal premier Christy Clark, who touted the prospect of LNG riches during her 2013 provincial election campaign, knows her prediction of three LNG terminals operating by 2020 won't come true, but she remains optimistic that other projects will be built in the long term. “LNG Canada's approval is confidence building for foreign investment in Canada," she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The new, NDP government, while vociferously opposed to the Trans Mountain expansion project, has also put its weight behind the natural-gas pipeline.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Shortly after forming a political alliance with the Green Party last year, the NDP cancelled an international LNG conference that had been slated for Vancouver, marking a low point for the province's LNG aspirations. Analysts were forecasting a global glut of LNG that would weigh on prices for years and obviate the need for new export terminals.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Behind the scenes, however, the NDP worked diligently to make LNG attractive to First Nations, following up on the legwork of the previous, Liberal government.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By September, 2017, the province had agreed to signing bonuses totalling $4.5million to Indigenous communities that backed the Coastal GasLink pipeline.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“First Nations that sign pipeline benefits agreements receive one-time signing payments," said an NDP government document marked “confidential issues note," released in response to a freedom of information request. “Entering into these agreements with First Nations is part of our commitment to ensure First Nations are partners and benefit from LNG development."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The NDP and the First Nations LNG Alliance organized meetings between government officials and Indigenous leaders across the province over a five-week period in the fall of 2017, gathering in Prince George, Smithers, Fort St. John, Vancouver and Terrace, the confidential note said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Premier John Horgan reached out to LNG Canada, asking what he could do.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Then, in its budget in February, 2018, the government included new incentives to spur LNG development, including salestax relief for construction and the elimination of a specific income tax on the industry.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ottawa played a key role, too. The federal government cleared the path for LNG Canada by agreeing that the massive terminal modules could not be made in Canada, so it effectively lifted the tariffs on the fabricated steel components from China.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Kitimat last month, more than a thousand residents gathered to celebrate the LNG Canada project go-ahead with a party capped by fireworks. Mr. Horgan said the venture is in the national interest, partly as a way of explaining why his government supports this project but not the Trans Mountain pipeline, which would originate in the neighbouring province. “I understand the disappointment and frustration of Albertans, but I think they have to look at this as a benefit to all Canadians," he said in an interview.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Natural gas – which is supercooled to minus-162 C to reduce its volume by turning it into a liquid, making it possible to transport by tanker ships – is considered less environmentally risky to export than oil. First Nations leaders say they fear the B.C. coast would be ruined by a bitumen spill, whereas a leak of LNG, which would likely evaporate, is viewed as an acceptable risk.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Gas vents, diluted bitumen doesn't. It's pretty simple. They're two different substances," Mr. Horgan said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Kitamaat Village, Kitimat and communities along the pipeline route, the massive LNG development will be transformative.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Crystal Smith, who has been the Haisla's chief councillor for the past two years, said LNG Canada will be significant for the community's economic well-being while also helping to address its social ills, such as alcoholism and mental-health issues.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I'm trying to provide economic opportunities, but also healing from all the trauma that our community has gone through," Ms. Smith said. “It just means so much," she said, as she surveyed the waters off the eastern shore of Douglas Channel, a short walk from her home. “We feel validation."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The region welcomed the opening of an aluminum smelter in 1954 but watched other industries abandon Kitimat, a community founded by Alcan Aluminum Ltd.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">in the early 1950s. A 24-year-old methanol plant shut down in 2006, then a 40-yearold pulp and paper mill closed in 2010.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now, Kitimat Mayor Phil Germuth is bracing for a boom in the months and years ahead. More than 4,500 workers will be required at LNG Canada's construction peak in 2022-23, ballooning the population of 8,000. Work camps will have to be built to house the bulk of the out-of-town employees.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are plans to finally construct headquarters for the District of Kitimat, whose offices are located on the third floor of the community's aging mall. “We will have a great tax base after LNG Canada gets built, and it would be nice to have a nice city hall that we can be proud of," Mr. Germuth said. A new fire station, upgrades to the water-treatment plant and even a new museum and art gallery are also on the wish list.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dianna Merkley has another reason to toast the LNG project: One of her sons works in Fort St. John in northeastern B.C.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">and flies in and out of a work camp there; another son moved away because he couldn't find work as an electrician. Now, the prospect of thousands of jobs will make it possible for people who grew up in Kitimat to stay or return to their hometown.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“There will be opportunities for my sons to work in town," said Ms. Merkley, an educational assistant who has lived in Kitimat for 37 years. “And it will be exciting when more families come in because we'll have more kids in our schools."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Haisla leaders say the economic spinoffs will go a long way toward reducing poverty and unemployment in Kitamaat Village. The Haisla have formed partnerships with construction company Ledcor Group, Triton Environmental Consultants Ltd. and forestry management firm Brinkman Forest Ltd. to win subcontracting work with LNG Canada.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prime Minister Justin Trudeau told a gathering of oil executives in Texas last year that, “No country would find 173 billion barrels of oil in the ground and just leave them there."</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The logic was sound when oil sands crude was selling for US$50 or US$60 a barrel. It's a lot less obvious after the price touched a record-low of less than US$14 a barrel this week.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Canadian crude has become the most discounted oil on the planet. The price collapse is a decidedly bad omen for Canada's oil patch, and the broader economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At today's prices, no one wants to extract the heavy oil buried deep in the ground. Some desperate producers would rather curtail output than sell oil at these bargain prices. A clutch of major Canadian oil sands producers – including Cenovus and <span class="companylink">Canadian Natural Resources</span> – are begging Alberta to order an industry-wide production cut to boost prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The chronic price gap between Western heavy crude and the North American benchmark, West Texas Intermediate, has grown to $40 a barrel in recent months, up from a typical spread of $15, costing the economy tens of billions of dollars.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Perhaps we could all just chill if the current depressed price was only a temporary blip, caused by transportation bottlenecks. Proposed pipeline projects, such as the Trans Mountain expansion and Keystone XL, would eventually ease the short-term price pressure.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But limited rail and pipeline capacity is not the only dark cloud on the horizon. The broader challenge is that Canada finds itself in the unenviable position of being the high-cost producer in a world awash in oil.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many large foreign players apparently saw the future, and have already fled, unloading billions of dollars in Canadian oil sands assets. <span class="companylink">Royal Dutch Shell</span>, Marathon, Statoil and <span class="companylink">ConocoPhillips</span> were all big sellers in 2017, leaving mainly Canadian-based producers in the oil sands.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Back in the early 2000s, the global oil industry saw the vast reserves buried in Alberta and Saskatchewan sand as essential to their future. The logic was that with dwindling reserves, even costly and technically challenging oil would eventually be needed. All the major global players wanted in.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Two factors have turned that reasoning on its head – the U.S.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">shale oil revolution and greenhouse gas emissions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hydraulic fracturing technology has made Canadian crude less essential than ever – a risk producers should think about as they consider shutting off the tap.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fracking has given the world an abundant new source of oil and gas that is relatively cheap to extract, and easy to turn on and off as prices fluctuate. Oil sands projects, on the other hand, can take nearly a decade from conception to production. The heavy crude they make is also more expensive to refine. And the oil sands, located far from consumers, is condemned to the role of price-taker in this uncertain energy market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The other obvious challenge is climate change. Oil sands crude is both high cost and energy intensive. Looming carbon taxes and emission restrictions are strikes against the industry.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Corporate social responsibility is not killing the oil sands, as some critics have suggested. Investors everywhere are re-evaluating – and repricing – climate risk. And when they do the math, the assumption that oil sands production will continue rising no longer seems inevitable.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So, yes, more pipelines would help. It's not like key players, including political leaders and chief executives, aren't doing everything they can to get them built.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The federal government, on behalf of Canadian tax payers, is investing nearly $12-billion to purchase and expand the Trans Mountain pipeline to get Alberta crude to foreign markets. Likewise, <span class="companylink">TransCanada Corp</span>. insists it isn't giving up on the Keystone XL pipeline, even after a federal judge quashed a U.S. presidential permit earlier this month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The price malaise hanging over Canadian heavy crude won't miraculously clear if one or both of these pipelines is approved.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nor will a forced production cut save the industry.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Canada produced a record 4.2 million barrels a day of oil in 2017, and is on a course to grow that to 6.2 million barrels a day by 2035.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Today's rock-bottom prices are a warning that the industry may never get there, and that the oil sand's best days are already in the rear-view mirror.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Liberal government's coming fall update will present an upbeat forecast for the Canadian economy, but that rosy assessment will not translate into a much smaller deficit.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ottawa's fiscal forecast will be broadly in line with the 2018 budget projection that the federal deficit – which was $19billion last year – will gradually decline in size, a senior government official told The Globe and Mail on Friday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The size of the federal debt will also be presented as shrinking over time as a share of GDP, according to the official, who was granted anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly on the matter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Wednesday's update is also expected to include measures to support Canada's news-media sector and targeted tax breaks for business to encourage investment, both of which have been previously signalled by the government.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Finance Minister Bill Morneau met on Friday with privatesector economists in Toronto.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“What I heard from the private-sector economists is both a sense that the economy is doing very well right now, but a concern that we think about how we respond to global challenges around trade, U.S. challenges around taxes and think about the big challenge we have right now in Alberta with the oil-price differential," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Canada's heavy-oil benchmark traded at record lows this week and at deeply discounted rates compared with the North American benchmark. Mr. Morneau did not indicate whether Ottawa is planning any action in response, but suggested that the sector's problems are an exception to an otherwise positive story regarding the Canadian economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The fiscal update will provide a sense of the Liberal government's direction in an election year. Mr. Morneau said the 2019 budget will include a focus on skills training for young Canadians.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Conservative Party will use an opposition day on Monday in the House of Commons to trigger a day-long debate on a motion calling on the government to set a clear date for when the deficit will be erased.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Conservative finance critic Pierre Poilievre said the Liberals promised in the 2015 campaign to balance the books by 2019 and it is time for the government to lay out its plans. He said the government's decision to run larger-than-promised deficits hinders its ability to respond to competitive pressures.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I think the government has put itself in an impossible situation," he said. “If it doesn't reduce taxes, we risk losing jobs to the Americans, and if it does reduce taxes, then we risk ballooning our already large deficit."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When Mr. Morneau tabled his February, 2018, budget, it was at a time of tremendous uncertainty over the future of Canada's relationship with the United States, its largest trading partner. The threat of an all-out trade war has since eased, although irritants remain in the form of U.S. tariffs on steel and aluminum.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The February budget promised a review of the impact of U.S. tax cuts approved earlier this year by U.S. President Donald Trump and the Republican-led Congress. Those tax cuts effectively erased Canada's competitive advantage in terms of corporate tax rates and included various short-term tax incentives to encourage business investment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The government official said the fall update will not lower Canada's corporate tax rates, but will include measures to encourage business investment. Mr. Morneau has been signalling for some time that he is open to expanding existing programs that allow businesses to write off business-investment expenses more quickly.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While Canadian business groups are urging Mr. Morneau to lower business taxes to boost Canadian competitiveness with the United States, questions are being raised south of the border over the sustainability of those tax cuts in light of a sharp increase in the size of the U.S. deficit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Former Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen made headlines recently when she told a public conference that the U.S. debt load was not sustainable in the face of demographic trends as more baby boomers retire.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“If I had a magic wand, I would raise taxes and cut retirement spending," Ms. Yellen said at a conference in Washington late last month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Canadian private-sector economists have already submitted their estimates to the Finance Department for economic growth, which are used to produce Ottawa's fiscal projections. Mr. Morneau's February, 2018, budget was based on expectations that the Canadian economy would grow by 2.2 per cent in 2018 and 1.6 per cent in 2019. Since then, the privatesector average forecast for GDP growth - as compiled by Consensus Economics - has dipped slightly for 2018 to 2.1 per cent while the outlook for 2019 has improved to 2.0 per cent.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SAGD revived the sputtering industry, and is now expected to drive growth in the oilsands.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Without it there wouldn't have been an oilsands industry in Alberta," said Dan Breznitz, professor and Munk Chair of I nnovation Studies at the <span class="companylink">University of Toronto</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">AOSTRA was seen as a template for how government-funded innovation ought to work: a temporary program crafted to meet private sector needs, and singularly focused on achieving one goal. But fast forward nearly 50 years, and it seems Canadian policymakers have taken few lessons from the program.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite spending piles of money on research and development in recent years, Canada's innovation space remains a messy tangle of government grant programs, tax credits and the newlyminted "supercluster" initiative, often with sprawling and ill-defined goals. Business investment in R&D, meanwhile, has stagnated. Many Canadian business leaders are calling for a reset.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Business sector spending on research and development has been in decline since 2001, falling from 1.2 per cent of GDP down to 0.9 per cent in 2015, well below a 16-country average of 1.7 per cent, according to the <span class="companylink">Conference Board of Canada</span>. That decline has come despite a steady rise in R&D spending in the public sector, particularly by higher education institutions, which has outpaced other developed nations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We spread around incentives like peanut butter - evenly - and that has a very negative set out of outcomes associated with it," said Anthony Lacavera, founder of Globalive Holdings, a Toronto-based investment firm, and of <span class="companylink">WIND Mobile</span>. WIND began as a startup that Lacavera later sold for $1.6 billion to <span class="companylink">Shaw Communications</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In his book How We Can Win: And What Happens to Us and Our Country If We Don't, a study of Canadian innovation policy, Lacavera points to pitfalls that have hindered innovative Canadian companies from growing into multinational "anchor" firms.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Business is about winners, and we need in Canada to start recognizing that we need to pick winners, and we need to help our companies become global success stories," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lacavera is advocating a return to an older form of innovation policy that focuses more on companies or specific areas rather than laboratories, and making bigger bets on fewer innovative firms. In short, that would mean taking a far less egalitarian, or perhaps "Canadian," approach.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Structurally, we are trying to excel in too many digital and knowledge economy areas," Lacavera said. "It's the Canadian style - spread it around, give everyone a shot. And then no one wins."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Experts have long called for an overhaul that could simplify Canadian innovation policy, starting with a streamlining of the various programs aimed at supporting promising firms. Ottawa went at least part way toward that in its 2018 budget, after promising to whittle down the total number of federal grant programs from 92 to around 35.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lacavera points to the Scientific Research and Experimental Development (SR&ED) tax credit as an area ripe for improvement. The tax credit dishes out more than $3 billion every year to reimburse research and development spending for thousands of companies, either at 15 per cent or 35 per cent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the program has been criticized for being geared too specifically toward smaller firms, effectively incentivizing laggard companies to remain small, even as they enjoy subsidies year after year. The issue has become so prevalent the program has been called the "Walking SRED" in some circles, a nod to the zombie TV series Walking Dead.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"You have companies that really should have already failed, or should have already been consolidated, or are really never going to get to scale, just sort of walking around," Lacavera said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Innovation programs can also add an administrative burden for entrepreneurs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Michael Katchen, cofounder and CEO of Wealthsimple Financial Inc., raised about $1 million through government programs in the early days of his company, from both the Industrial Research Assistance Program (IRAP), a long-standing federal program aimed at small and medium-sized companies, and The Federal Economic Development Agency for Southern Ontario, which offers early-stage loans to firms.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Katchen said the process was administratively intensive, forcing the small firm to hire a consultant just to assist with the mounds of paperwork. What's more, the application process for Fed-Dev effectively repeated the due diligence already carried out by Impression Ventures, a venture capital firm that invested $1.9 million in Wealthsimple in September 2014.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The most bizarre part of it was I had just raised $1.9 million from really sophisticated investors, and I had to start from scratch on an even more arduous process, this time from a much less-sophisticated government agency," Katchen said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, business owners are also quick to defend Ottawa's innovation efforts under Navdeep Bains, the minister of Innovation, Science and Economic Development.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"In general the current government has been very supportive," Katchen said, but added that in meetings with Bains he has suggested Canada needs to be more ambitious in attracting talent and innovative companies. "We can't match dollar-for-dollar investments that other bigger countries are making, so we need to pick our spots and really double down."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prime Minister Justin Trudeau made innovation a central part of his mandate in 2016, underpinned by a new initiative to create several innovation superclusters.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Those policy efforts were then bulked up again in the 2017 budget when Ottawa raised spending on university research and development.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even so, critics argue the $950-million superclusters program is a drop in the bucket when considering it is spread across five different groups, encapsulating everything from protein-rich potatoes to marine sensors that track animal activity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's what you would call an accounting error if you look at the overall budget," Munk's Breznitz said. Breznitz suggests Canada should instead unleash its capital from various government programs and funnel it directly into a few select sectors where Canada has demonstrated potential: artificial intelligence, stem cell research, autonomous car manufacturing or financial services, to name a few. Most important, he says, funding should go directly to technologies that can be sold on the market, rather than on tests in the laboratory.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Where the federal government should be focusing is on what needs to be done to move more Canadian companies towards R&D - full stop," Breznitz said. "Instead, any time there's a hot new trend, something new and shiny, we spend a lot of money on it. And we spend almost no time looking at how to turn this into an industry."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Such solutions come with their own set of challenges, however. By loosening government controls over how capital is spent, and by funnelling capital more directly into companies and technologies, Ottawa runs the risk of throwing billions of dollars at abject failures.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Indeed, Jack Mintz, fellow at the University of Calgary's School of Public Policy, is wary of government-directed innovation that can be subject to the vagaries of politics.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Governments are not great at picking winners, but losers are great at picking governments," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Take, for example, Ottawa's recent decision to use its Strategic Innovation Fund (SIF) to pay out $250 million in reimbursements for steel and aluminum producers hurt by U.S. President Donald Trump's trade tariffs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But observers argue that direct programs are nonetheless preferable to the more passive, and widespread, tax credit system. A 2011 report by Tom Jenkins, now the chair of the National Research Council, recommended Ottawa scrap much of its tax credits for corporations in favour of higher direct spending on innovation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's an approach that even skeptics are warming up to.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I've been leaning more towards grants these days," said Mintz. "The one criticism of a grant rather than a tax credit is it can be used politically. But I think if it's administered well, it can certainly be subjected to far less political intervention."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The way forward for Canada then, is perhaps a policy much bolder than its current form. The right government program helped usher in the second wave of oilsands development. Similar breakthroughs are crucial, especially if Canada wants to be front and centre of the next industrial shift.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"In Canada we do two things that employ every single person: we pull resources out of the ground and we finance that activity," Wealthsimple's Katchen said. "That's our economy in a nutshell. Twenty years from now that will not be true - or if it's true, we're in trouble."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Canada has a long list of government grant programs and tax credits available to innovative - or even not-so-innovative - businesses. That list could soon get a lot shorter after Ottawa announced in its 2018 budget it would streamline the number of existing federal grant programs from 92 down to around 35. Private firms have long complained that applying for funds is a difficult process, largely due to a confusing thicket of offerings. Here is a brief rundown of some of the most prominent programs: <span class="companylink">Scientific Research</span> and Experimental Development (SR&ED) A tax credit program that effectively reimburses Canadian businesses for investments in research and development. It is administered by the <span class="companylink">Canada Revenue Agency</span>. Companies can claim input tax credits (ITCs) at either 15 per cent or 35 per cent, depending on the company and size of investment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Industrial Research Assistance Program (IRAP): A program aimed at scaling up innovations in small and mediumsized companies. IRAP is one of the oldest programs in Canada, founded shortly after the Second World War. Contributions come in the form of anything from consultations to financing for innovation. It is administered by the <span class="companylink">National Research Council of Canada</span>, and is widely considered one of the most effective programs of its kind.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Canada Small Business Financing Program (CSBFP) A program that offers loans to businesses with gross revenues of $10 million or less. Loans can be a maximum of $1 million. Southern Ontario Fund for Investment in Innovation (SOFII) A federal initiative that offers loans to companies in southwestern Ontario. Loans range from $150,000 to $500,000, and are geared toward helping small and medium-sized companies scale up technologies. It is supported through the Federal Economic Development Agency for Southern Ontario (FedDev Ontario). Strategic Innovation Fund (SIF) A fund focused on "encouraging R&D," attracting investments, facilitating growth and advancing industrial research.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The fund will spend $1.26 billion over five years (ending in 2023) in both repayable and non-repayable contributions to companies and post-secondary institutions. Sustainable Development Technology Canada (SDTC) An agency focused on developing clean technologies. SDTC oversees two separate funds. One is the SD Tech Fund, totalling $550 million, which provides money to pre-commercial clean technology projects aimed at greening air, water and soil.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Non-IFRS Measures: Non-IFRS measures do not have any standardized meanings prescribed by IFRS and may not be comparable with the calculation of similar measures used by other entities. Non-IFRS measures should not be considered alternatives to, or more meaningful than, measures determined in accordance with IFRS as indicators of the Company’s performance.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This press release contains the terms “adjusted income before taxes”, “adjusted net income (loss)” and “adjusted net income (loss) per share” which management considers to be key measures of performance before the effect of certain expenses that, although classified as operating activities in accordance with IFRS, are not expected to recur with the same magnitude or frequency and/or for which there are no similar expenses in the comparative periods. For a reconciliation of “adjusted income before taxes”, “adjusted net income (loss)” and “adjusted net income (loss) per share” to the most directly comparable measures calculated in accordance with IFRS, see the Company's MD&A.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This press release contains the terms “funds flow from (used by) operations” and "funds flow per share – operations" which should not be considered alternatives to, or more meaningful than, cash flow from (used by) operations and cash flow per share – operations as determined in accordance with IFRS as an indicator of the Company’s performance. Management uses funds flow from (used by) operations to analyze operating performance and considers funds flow from (used by) operations to be a key measure as it demonstrates the Company’s ability to generate cash necessary to fund future capital investment. Funds flow per share – operations is calculated using the basic and diluted weighted average number of shares for the period consistent with the calculations of earnings per share. For a reconciliation of funds flow from (used by) operations to cash flow from (used by) operations, which is the most directly comparable measure calculated in accordance with IFRS, see the Company's MD&A.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This press release also contains other industry benchmarks and terms, including “operating netbacks” (calculated on a per unit basis as oil, natural gas and NGL revenues less royalties, transportation and operating costs), which is a non-IFRS measure. See "TDF Operating Netback" for the calculation of operating netback. Management believes this measure is a useful supplemental measure of the Company’s profitability relative to commodity prices. Readers are cautioned, however, that operating netbacks should not be construed as an alternative to other terms such as net income as determined in accordance with IFRS as measures of performance. Crown Point’s method of calculating this measure may differ from other companies, and accordingly, may not be comparable to similar measures used by other companies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Abbreviations and BOE Presentation: "3-D" means three dimensional. "API" means American Petroleum Institute gravity, being an indication of the specific gravity of crude oil measured on the API gravity scale. "bbl" means barrel. "bbls" means barrels. "BOE" means barrels of oil equivalent. "km" means kilometres; "km2" means square kilometres; “LACT” means lease automatic custody transfer; "m3" means cubic metres. “mcf” means thousand cubic feet. "NGL" means natural gas liquids. "Q3" means the three months ended September 30. "Q4" means the three months ended December 31. "<span class="companylink">YPF</span>" means Yacimientos Petrolíferos Fiscales S.A.All BOE conversions in this press release are derived by converting natural gas to oil in the ratio of six mcf of gas to one bbl of oil. BOE may be misleading, particularly if used in isolation. A BOE conversion ratio of six mcf of gas to one bbl of oil (6 mcf: 1 bbl) is based on an energy equivalency conversion method primarily applicable at the burner tip and does not represent a value equivalency at the wellhead. Given that the value ratio based on the current price of crude oil as compared to natural gas in Argentina is significantly different from the energy equivalency conversion ratio of 6:1, utilizing a conversion on a 6:1 basis is misleading as an indication of value.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">OTTAWA — The federal government is expected to lay out fresh plans next week to support Canada's struggling news industry.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The measures, expected in Finance Minister Bill Morneau's fall economic statement Wednesday, will be designed to help journalism remain viable after years of shrinking advertising revenues.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The decline has already shuttered newsrooms, led to job cuts in many others, and eroded coverage of key democratic institutions across Canada — everything from municipal councils to provincial legislatures to Parliament.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In last winter's federal budget, Ottawa committed $50 million over five years for local journalism in "underserved communities."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The government also pledged in the budget to search for additional ways of supporting Canadian journalism.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Internal federal documents obtained by The Canadian Press under access-to-information legislation say the government assembled a working group of officials from the finance and heritage departments following the February budget.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Their goal, the memo said, was "to identify options to address the issues affecting journalism in Canada ahead of the fall economic statement."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The fall statement will be one of the last opportunities in the current fiscal year to announce the new measures.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"A range of options to ensure the continued viability of the journalism industry in Canada are being considered," reads the briefing note prepared for deputy finance minister Paul Rochon ahead of his meeting last July with the president and the publisher of Montreal's La Presse newspaper.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the budget, Ottawa promised to take a closer look at potential models to enable private donations and philanthropic support for "trusted, professional, non-profit journalism and local news."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The government said eventual steps could include new ways for Canadian newspapers to innovate and receive charitable status for "not-for-profit" journalism.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The briefing document for Rochon noted how La Presse announced its plan to adopt a not-for-profit structure last May — a couple of months after the budget — to position the newspaper to take advantage of the federal commitments on journalism.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A separate July briefing note laid out options for "government action" but those sections of the document were redacted.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There are calls for the government to intervene to save the legacy newspapers under the premise that this is the key way of ensuring the continued production of civic-function journalism," reads the memo.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The document summarized recent industry trends — including how overall operating revenues tumbled to $3.2 billion in 2016 from their peak of $5.5 billion in 2008. The decrease included a steep drop of 34 per cent between 2012 and 2016.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It said the decline has been caused mainly by falling advertising revenues and, when it comes to online ads, noted how Canadian news outlets have struggled to compete with giants like <span class="companylink">Facebook</span> and <span class="companylink">Google</span>, which scoop up about 80 per cent of the digital business.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The number of daily newspapers in Canada was down to just 88 by May 2018, the document said. A decade earlier, there had been 139.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The news industry's challenges have also led to job losses. The memo said news organizations slashed salary spending by 37 per cent between 2006 and 2016, a period that saw the number of workers in the industry fall to 24,000 from 36,000. Between 2007 and 2017, employment in journalist positions declined 5.7 per cent — to 11,688 from 12,396.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There are indications that journalists are less able to cover stories about Canada's democratic institutions. Dedicated coverage of public interest news (e.g. legislatures, town halls, courts) has declined," the note said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the lead up to the federal budget, the government was bombarded with ideas on how to help the news industry.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A report last year from the Public Policy Forum called for a sales tax on foreign companies selling digital subscriptions in Canada, a fund to help finance reliable news and information with $100 million in federal seed money, a new "local" mandate for news agency The Canadian Press and changes to the CBC's online advertising.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More generally, the fiscal update will focus on making the Canadian economy more competitive, Morneau indicated Friday in Toronto after meeting with private-sector economists.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"What you're going to see us talking about next week is how we can ensure we can continue to be successful in the face of challenges that we're seeing. We're seeing the economy right now doing well, but we recognize that we need to think about how we're competitive tomorrow and the day after, so that we can create the kind of jobs we want for young people like the ones that are in this room," he said at a Kiwanis Boys and Girls Club event.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"What I heard from the private-sector economists is both a sense that our economy is doing very well right now, but a concern that we think about how we respond to global challenges around trade, U.S. challenges around taxes, and think about the big challenge we have right now in Alberta with the oil-price differential."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Crude oil from Alberta hit a record-low price of $14 a barrel this week. Light demand for oil is pushing prices down everywhere, but the benchmark price for American oil is about $50 a barrel higher. Canadian producers are suffering because there's more oil sitting around here than they can physically move to buyers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Morneau also has been under pressure from business groups to cut Canadian corporate taxes to better compete with the United States, where President Donald Trump has done the same.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the finance minister is widely expected to steer in a different direction next week, instead introducing measures to make write-downs on capital investments more generous.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When asked about the impact of low oil prices on the federal books, he pointed to the strong national economy but expressed some concern for Alberta.</p>

More money for a revenue starved government?Judging from the treatment the energy industry is receiving in Canada it is no wonder many of the Global energy companies and investors are fleeing Canada to more welcoming jurisdictions.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In response to gordon2j7:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The downturn in oil industry was created by the fact that for most production in Alberta, it costs more to produce oil than the market is willing to pay for it. The current low crude prices are due to the fact that the global demand for crude is currently lower than the global supply. Both have absolutely nothing to do with anything any government in Canada has done. This article seems to suggest that additional pipelines and export infrastructure might correct this. In fact, pipelines would actually increase the supply further above demand, only adding to the trend for prices to decline. - Sunshine Coaster[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/business/article-call-for-crude-production-quotas-splits-oil-patch/?commentId=ea237946-323c-4818-be44-1e9f00887456]

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Canada is losing $100 million a day because we have one customer and limited access to tidewater. That’s why the the differential is $40/barrel, it is directly related to market access. The oil price isn’t the issue - the spread is, we are giving US businesses billions in subsidies every year instead of keeping the revenue in Canada. - ChuckT[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/business/article-call-for-crude-production-quotas-splits-oil-patch/?commentId=fa36167d-d5e2-4db0-b108-d9af237bbbad]

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Raymond James analyst Daryl Swetlishoff upgraded his rating for <span class="companylink">Canfor Corp</span>. ( CFP-T[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/investing/markets/stocks/CFP-T/] ) following its “transformative accretive” $580-million acquisition of a 70-per-cent stake in Swedish sawmill company Vida Group.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“While this deal clearly surprised the market, we see it as very much in line with Canfor’s well-defined growth strategy centered around high-quality timber facilitating the manufacture of prime solid wood products,” said Mr. Swetlishoff. “Geographic diversification is the key to this deal. Reducing exposure to the timber-short, high-cost B.C. interior region while gaining more stable product pricing is a big win, in our opinion. While investors may be disappointed Canfor is not instead buying back more shares at current depressed levels, this action would cement the regional status quo. Over time, we expect the potential for more stable earnings to be rewarded with higher trading multiples. We expect that sawmill curtailment announcements have put a floor under lumber pricing and recommend investors take advantage of the outsized negative market reaction to add to positions.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Moving Canfor to "strong buy" from "outperform," the analyst said diversification was the "key motivator" for the deal and sees more stable earnings ahead for the Vancouver-based company.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Prior to this announcement, Canfor had 67 per cent of lumber assets in the B.C. interior region,” he said. "Due to Mountain Pine Beetle and wildfire-related log shortages; BC-delivered log cost inflation has resulted in the region becoming the high-cost NA producing region – a key reason for our prior less favourable Outperform rating. Proforma this deal, Canfor will have material operations in B.C., the U.S. South, and now Europe extending global reach with freight logical access to all major world markets. While Canfor announced a tuck-in U.S. South acquisition last Friday, we highlight that similar scale M&A opportunities are rare in that region.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“A key gripe from generalist investors dabbling in the forest sector has been the extreme commodity and hence earnings volatility. We expect this is a key contributor to the very low current trading multiples. With a high proportion of prime grades and proprietary products, we expect Canfor Euro ops to add a measure of stability to reported earnings, which over time has the potential to lead to better valuations.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Swetlishoff raised his target for Canfor shares to $35 from $32. The average target on the Street is $28.54, according to Thomson Reuters Eikon data.</p>

<span class="companylink">Tervita Corp</span>. ( TEV-T[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/investing/markets/stocks/TEV-T/] ) entered the public market “with a bang,” said Industrial Alliance Securities analyst Elias Foscolos.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Calgary-based company, which was formed from the recent merger of <span class="companylink">Newalta Corp</span>. and <span class="companylink">Tervita Corp</span>. and began trading on the TSX in mid-July, reported better-than-anticipated third-quarter financial results after the close on Wednesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Adjusted EBITDA of $71-million easily topped the $58-million expectation on the Street, due largely to a strong performance from its Energy Services segment. Net revenue of $203-million also beat Mr. Foscolos's estimate ($197-million).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With the results, the analyst raised his 2019 adjusted earnings per share forecast to 82 cents from 61 cents.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With a "buy" rating (unchanged), his target for Tervita shares increased to $13.50 from $11. The average on the Street is $12.57.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">=====</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Following weaker-than-expected third-quarter financial results, <span class="companylink">Desjardins Securities</span> analyst Keith Howlett thinks the fourth quarter takes on added importance for <span class="companylink">Leon’s Furniture Ltd</span>. ( LNF-T[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/investing/markets/stocks/LNF-T/] ).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Leading big-ticket retailers experienced weak demand in 3Q18, which appears at odds with the strength of employment, wages and economic growth,” said Mr. Howlett, questioning whether a dip in demand was temporary or a “sign of a big-ticket slowdown.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Wednesday, the retailer reported comparable corporate store sales dropped by 1.6 per cent in the quarter, the first decline in three years. Adjusted earnings per share of 42 cents fell below the 45-cent expectation of both Mr. Howlett and the Street.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Management noted that Ontario was relatively weak, although small markets performed better than urban areas," the analyst said. "Sleep Country management had also called out Ontario as a relatively weak market. Given elections and trade talks during 3Q, we are not ready to call a change of trend."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In reaction to the results, Mr. Howlett lowered his 2018 and 2019 EPS estimates to $1.29 and $1.40, respectively, from $1.37 and $1.46.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With a "buy" rating (unchanged), he dropped his target for Leon's shares to $20 from $21. The average is now $19.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Elsewhere, CIBC World Markets analyst Matt Bank lowered his target to $18 from $21, maintaining a “neutral” rating.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Leon’s is operating in an increasingly difficult consumer and competitive environment. While a strong balance sheet and costefficiency potential offer upside and optionality, we trim our forecasts and target multiple,” said Mr. Bank.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Based on regulatory changes that have pushed its municipal aggregation portfolio into the red, RBC Dominion Securities analyst Nelson Ng lowered his target price for <span class="companylink">Crius Energy Trust</span> ( KWH.UN-T[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/investing/markets/stocks/KWH-UN-T/] ), despite seeing it “well on its way” to achieving an adjusted EBITDA run-rate of $100-million in 2019.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Crius has grown its municipal aggregation portfolio to 300,000 RCEs [residential customer equivalent] (22 per cent of total RCEs) over the last several years,” he said. "However, over the summer, Massachusetts increased the Renewable Portfolio Standards (RPS) requirements, and New Jersey increased transmission costs in relation to the Regional Transmission Expansion Plan (RTEP), which increased Crius’s cost to serve customers. Crius was not able to pass through most of the costs to customers, resulting in an unprofitable (negative margin) municipal aggregation portfolio. Management plans to run off (through 2020) or divest the portfolio.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Over the next several quarters, we expect new retail customer additions to generate $20–25 per megawatt-hour of gross margins and commercial customers $5–10/MWh, while the run-off of unprofitable municipal aggregation customers will further improve gross margins. Although the 300,000 RCEs of municipal aggregation customers that management wants to run off or divest may exceed new customer additions, we expect the profitability of the customer book (embedded gross margin is a good proxy) to improve."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Ng expects the Toronto-based company, which reported third-quarter results on Wednesday, to be "lean and clean" in 2019, seeing the benefits of cost-saving initiatives and the wind-down of its solar business as well a lack of restructuring changes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">However, he lowered his adjusted EBITDA forecast through fiscal 2020 to account for both the quarterly results and the expectation of further net customer attrition.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Keeping an "outperform" rating, Mr. Ng lowered his target by a loonie to $9 "to reflect a moderate reduction in our forecast due to headwinds from the municipal aggregation portfolio." The average on the Street is $8.55.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, <span class="companylink">Desjardins Securities</span>' Bill Cabel also dropped his target to $9 from $10, keeping a "buy" rating.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Cabel said: "While efforts to strategically realign the business have unfolded in line and on time with expectations, and are on the cusp of completion, another mis-step (this time in the muni agg business) has derailed recently gained momentum. The stock is clearly out of favour, but the deeply discounted valuation (3.5 times EV/EBITDA), safe dividend (2019 payout ratio of 57 per cent) and very attractive yield (15 per cent) should be very rewarding to those investors willing to believe in a clean 2019."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Canaccord Genuity analyst Brendon Abrams does not expect the Alberta rental apartment business to bounce back following years of deceleration brought on by the struggles of the energy industry, leading him to lower his financial expectations for <span class="companylink">Boardwalk Real Estate Investment Trust</span> ( BEI.UN-T[https://beta.theglobeandmail.com/investing/markets/stocks/BEI-UN-T] ).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We are now approximately four years past the beginning of the oil downturn that precipitated a major economic recession in Alberta,” he said. "And while most investors perhaps were not anticipating a full recovery to the ‘good old days’ of 2014, we do not believe either that many have fully baked-in the prospect that the current rental apartment environment in Alberta could be the ‘new normal.’ Following Boardwalk’s underwhelming Q3/18 results, most notably a lack of meaningful sequential revenue growth, despite significant capital invested into the portfolio over the past two years, we are leaning very heavily towards the latter than the former.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“In addition, we believe investors (and analysts) are, once again, ‘recalibrating’ expectations after having waited several quarters (or in some instances years) for a strong and sustained recovery. While we acknowledge the market has bottomed, what we have seen instead is a very slow and gradual recovery with no obvious catalyst to drive rents meaningfully higher. We continue to watch very closely leading indicators which would have us change our view including multi-family units under construction, net migration patterns, and employment trends. However, none of these suggest to us a material rebound in the near term. An expectation that current woes facing Alberta’s primary economic driver, the energy sector, will be resolved in the near term requires in our opinion a very optimistic viewpoint.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Abrams lowered his 2018 and 2019 funds from operations projections to $2.25 and $2.54, respectively, from $2.29 and $2.55.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With a “hold” rating, he dropped his target for Boardwalk units to $45 from $48. The average target is currently $50.38.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Elsewhere, CIBC World Markets analyst Dean Wilkinson maintained a "neutral" rating and $49 target.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Wilkinson said: "Boardwalk reported its fourth sequential quarter of positive SP [same property] revenue growth. While the recent trend appears to be somewhat decelerating on a slight occupancy decline, we would expect that as rental incentives burn off through 2019, the overall trend should remain biased to the upside. We surmise the initial negative price reaction to what was otherwise an in-line and arguably rather uneventful quarter may be routed more in the sentiment inherent in the REITs geography than in its operations per se.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“To the extent Boardwalk is potentially viewed as a derivative energy play (as has been historically the case), then the recent weakness in oil, and specifically WCS, may be having a negative (albeit delayed) impact on the units; i.e. it’s catching up (or down as it may be) to other energy-centric companies.”</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Citing “weak” third-quarter results and forbearance on a senior secured facility credit agreement, Raymond James analyst Steven Li downgraded <span class="companylink">UrtheCast Corp</span>.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Wednesday, the Vancouver-based earth observation company reported revenue for the quarter of $3.4-million, well below the $7.3-million consensus expectation. EBITDA of a loss of $6.8-million also missed projections (a $2.7-million loss).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Oct. 26, <span class="companylink">UrtheCast</span> announced an event of default has occurred under its senior facility credit agreement as a result of the recent resignation of Fabrizio Pirondini as an executive.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"UR has entered into a forbearance agreement with the lenders under which they have agreed to refrain from taking any actions until Nov. 23, 2018," said Mr. Li. "No amount is outstanding under the credit agreement with the practical consequence of the event of default is that the lenders are not obligated to fund UrtheDaily under the Credit Agreement. UR is actively negotiating with the current senior lenders as well as exploring alternate financing solutions. While UrtheDaily backlog currently amounts to $34-million in potential annual recurring revenues, the financing snafu could delay UrtheDaily constellation build (or worst, may not happen at all)."</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Canada's oil sector is divided over whether to force a temporary cut to production, with some major producers pushing the controversial idea in a bid to ease a supply glut and halt a steep plunge in prices, according to seven people familiar with the matter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Executives from <span class="companylink">Canadian Natural Resources Ltd</span>. and <span class="companylink">Nexen Energy ULC</span> are among those who made the pitch to Alberta's premier last month, the people said, speaking on condition of anonymity as the meeting was private. <span class="companylink">Cenovus Energy Inc</span>. is also publicly advocating for a forced cut.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The producers called on Rachel Notley to invoke a provincial government power to force "curtailment," the people said, at a time when Canadian heavy crude is selling for a near-record discount from U.S. benchmark prices, costing Alberta billions. Some called for a temporary 10 per cent cut, or about 380,000 barrels per day, until the market stabilizes, the people said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the push is opposed by <span class="companylink">Suncor Energy Inc</span>.; <span class="companylink">ExxonMobil Corp</span>.'s Canadian unit, <span class="companylink">Imperial Oil Ltd</span>.; and <span class="companylink">Husky Energy Inc</span>., the people say. Each has integrated operations, from production to refineries, that cushion the blow and therefore want to let the market sort out the oversupply issue.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Notley's government has publicly lowered expectations for intervention. She emerged from the meeting calling for the purchase of more oil-hauling rail cars, but didn't advocate curtailment. The unusual standoff reflects the dire straits most producers are in.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"At the price that Albertans are getting for their oil, no one is making any money whatsoever in the upstream industry. At the same time, number of producers who are integrated with refineries are making windfall profits," Cenovus chief executive officer Alex Pourbaix told BNN Bloomberg television on Wednesday, declining to name names.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Canadian producers are not only being hit by the global plunge in oil prices, but face severe transport bottlenecks that have caused the northern nation's customary discount to balloon to near record highs. A barrel of Canadian heavy crude was worth $15.75 (U.S.) on Wednesday afternoon.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pipelines are full and new ones are almost impossible to build thanks to regulatory and political challenges. Storage facilities and rail cars are also at capacity. If sustained, the steep discount will cost government coffers billions while kneecapping the oil sector. <span class="companylink">Peters & Co</span>. estimated last week Alberta could lose at least $5 billion in royalties.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"What we're trying to do is see the government take very moderate action in terms of production levels in order to avoid an economic catastrophe," Pourbaix said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Oct. 22, key industry figures gathered in an old downtown Calgary school now used as an office for the premier. The closed-door meeting was chaired by Notley herself and featured top executives from both upstream and integrated oil producers trying to persuade her of their respective positions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The gathering was so unusual that Suncor's representative, chief operating officer Mark Little, began by warning the meeting itself might violate Canadian competition law, if it amounted to price-fixing, three of the people said. Notley said government action was the focus and discussions continued, those people said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Upstream producers didn't suggest firm timelines, but some envision a 10 per cent cut to production for anywhere from three to six months, the people said. The government power they're asking Notley to exercise was last used under premier Peter Lougheed a generation ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They argue the temporary cut would allow a backlog to be processed and potentially trigger a recovery in prices. Their integrated opponents urged Notley to let the market function and also warned that intervening could jeopardize the new North American trade deal with the U.S. and Mexico, given President Donald Trump's criticism of the <span class="companylink">Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A Husky spokesperson referred to comments made by its chief executive on a recent conference call. "We think the right answer to these sort of problems are market-based solutions," Rob Peabody said Oct. 25.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">Imperial Oil</span> declined to comment on the specifics of the meeting but also cited recent comments by CEO Richard Kruger, who said Nov. 2 "our view is you live with the consequences of your decisions in your investments."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On the intervention side, Cenovus went public with its support for a price cap on Monday and others are now following suit. "As Canadians we are not getting fair value for our resource, and action by the government to temporarily reduce production across the oilsands industry is warranted," Quinn Wilson, North American chief executive officer of CNOOC International Ltd., said on behalf of <span class="companylink">Nexen</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Athabasca Oil Corp.'s chief executive was also at the meeting. "This is an unprecedented situation with significant market constraints, and there are companies that are profiting from the market conditions," Rob Broen said in a phone interview late Tuesday. "The government needs to take some action."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pipeline giants <span class="companylink">TransCanada Corp</span>. and <span class="companylink">Enbridge Inc</span>. also sat in on the meeting, the people said, but stayed largely neutral to avoid aggravating one group of clients over another. Both companies declined to comment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The scene, though, was bizarre to some in the room. Calgary is the heart of Canada's conservative movement, and Alberta considers itself a champion of free-market economics. The province elected the left-leaning New Democratic Party in something of a fluke of circumstance in 2015, and the notion that oil executives would be pressing a leftist premier to cap their production would have been unheard of only a few years ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For now, Notley's government is downplaying the controversy. She does have the power to cut production, but "that bare-bones legal authority" hails from a different era, according Mike McKinnon, a spokesperson for her energy minister.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Resignations, calls for her ouster and even talk of another referendum. British Prime Minister Theresa May is facing attacks from politicians on all sides as she tries to push forward with her draft Brexit agreement struck with the <span class="companylink">European Union</span>. Here’s a primer[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/world/article-brexit-deal-may-explainer/] on the unfolding crisis:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tory party turmoil: Four of May’s cabinet ministers have resigned, including Brexit secretary Dominic Raab who said the agreement would keep Britain too closely tied to the <span class="companylink">EU</span>. Roughly 50 MPs in May’s Conservative Party said they won’t vote for the deal. There’s talk of a confidence vote on May’s leadership, with 48 Tory MPs needed to call for one. For her part, May said: “Leadership is about taking the right decisions, not the easy ones. … Am I going to see this through? Yes.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The other parties: Labour Leader Jeremy Corbyn rejected the deal as “half baked,” saying “the government is falling apart before our eyes.” Liberal Democrat Leader Vince Cable said that another referendum should be held if the vote fails in the House of Commons.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What comes next: <span class="companylink">British Parliament</span> is set to vote on the agreement in early December. May will need to garner enough support from MPs in opposition parties, despite all party leaders coming out against the deal. If she can’t and it’s voted down, the government has 21 days to come up with a new plan and if that fails, what comes next is unclear. Britain could still leave the <span class="companylink">EU</span> in March without a deal, or there could be an election or second referendum.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Background on the proposed deal: This is purely a withdrawal agreement; the terms would give Britain and the <span class="companylink">EU</span> until December of 2020 to negotiate a trade deal. During that time Britain would essentially remain an <span class="companylink">EU</span> member. If a deal can’t be reached by the end of 2020, Britain could decide to invoke a backstop to remain in the <span class="companylink">EU</span> customs union while adding protection for Northern Ireland to ensure its border with Ireland remains virtually barrier-free.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Canadian side: John Ibbitson writes[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/politics/article-a-post-brexit-rebound-relationship-with-canada-would-be-rich-in-irony/] : “Assuming the chaotic mess at Westminster somehow resolves itself, and Brexit actually occurs next March 29, the first free-trade agreement the British sign outside the <span class="companylink">EU</span> could be with Canada, reversing the relationship between the mother country and her former dominion.” (for subscribers)</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Crude prices punished – and Alberta’s oil industry is divided on what to do</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Canada’s heavy-oil benchmark fell to US$13.46 a barrel yesterday, its lowest closing price on record. While prices stabilized on Friday[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/business/article-oil-firms-on-supply-cut-talk-still-set-for-sixth-weekly-loss/] morning, the recent drop has prompted[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/business/article-call-for-crude-production-quotas-splits-oil-patch/] some energy firms to urge Alberta Premier Rachel Notley to intervene and force production cuts (for subscribers). Artificially reducing supply would raise crude prices, Cenovus, MEG and others say. But Suncor and Husky – whose refining operations benefit from low prices – oppose government action and say such a move would trigger U.S. retaliation. A major factor for the price crash is a shortage of pipeline capacity as production increases. Without the means to ship, producers are finding themselves with a backlog of inventory and are selling at steep discounts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Police say a prestigious Toronto private school didn’t report an alleged sexual assault</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The police force said it learned[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/canada/toronto/article-st-michaels-failed-to-notify-toronto-police-about-alleged-sexual/] about the alleged incident at St. Michael’s College School after receiving information from the media. Officers are now investigating the incident, which is said to involve a football team where a group of boys held down another student and allegedly sexually assaulted him with an object. The incident was captured on video and circulated among students; police have said the footage meets the definition of child pornography and that anyone who has it must delete it. St. Michael’s has cancelled the rest of its junior football team’s season.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The school told parents in a letter on Wednesday that it had involved authorities after learning about “two very serious incidents.” But police said the school only informed them of one case, believed to involve the basketball team bullying a student and soaking him with water.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Canada appears poised to issue sanctions against Saudi officials</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Foreign Affairs Minister Chrystia Freeland said her government[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/world/article-saudi-prosecutors-seek-death-penalty-for-five-suspects-in-khashoggi/] “welcomes” new U.S. sanctions against 17 Saudis linked to Jamal Khashoggi’s killing and indicated Canada is “actively considering” following suit with its own measures. That came as Saudi Arabia’s public prosecutor said he would seek the death penalty for five people said to be involved in the murder and dismemberment of the dissident journalist. Washington’s sanctions are likely to include a ban on travel to the U.S. and a freeze on financial assets there. Canadian penalties would probably be similar.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Here’s the view from Campbell Clark[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/politics/article-crown-prince-must-be-held-accountable-for-khashoggis-killing/] : “Targeting those 17 Saudis for sanctions still amounts to accepting the idea that these were rogue agents. Until Western governments start to zoom in on the man with iron-clad power over Saudi Arabia and its security services – Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, widely known as MBS – we’re still being asked to believe fiction.”</p>

Oil rose on hopes supply cuts will be agreed at <span class="companylink">OPEC</span>’s meeting on Dec. 6, but failed to recoup recent losses.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">McGill shouldn’t need a vote to do the right thing – and change its team name</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“In 2017, the McGill Provost’s Task Force on Indigenous Studies and Indigenous Education recommended ‘moving forward under a McGill team name that breaks with the associations that ‘Redmen’ evokes in contemporary society.’ In the name of reconciliation, and basic respect toward Canada’s Indigenous peoples, that seems like the right thing to do. Surely, there are any number of alternative team names available to McGill, which was founded in 1821 and has almost 200 years of history to draw on. What about the McGill Reds? Or Celtics, given founder James McGill’s Scottish origins? Or Martlets, as the women’s teams are already called, in a reference to the birds on the McGill coat of arms? Reconciliation isn’t all about big gestures. Simple ones matter just as much.” – Konrad Yakabuski[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/opinion/article-mcgill-shouldnt-need-a-vote-to-do-the-right-thing-and-change-its/] (for subscribers)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Doctors must speak out on gun violence – because it is our lane</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The gun debate is the centre of my professional highway. I was on call on July 22, 2018 – the night that two people were killed and 13 others injured in a mass shooting on Danforth Avenue in Toronto. I am a trauma surgeon, having worked for nearly two decades at one of the country’s busiest trauma centres. I know of what I speak. From my lane, my team and I have resuscitated, operated on, cared for, consoled and attended funerals of far too many victims of horrific gun violence. Our lane is the lane from which we will do the research that helps us to understand how to prevent gun deaths in Canada. From our lane we will ask questions about what the proliferation of guns in Canada means for the health of our families, towns and cities. From our lane we will treat the victims of gun violence and quite literally sew back together the shattered organs, vessels and lives torn apart by bullets fired by guns.” –  Najma Ahmed [https://www.theglobeandmail.com/opinion/article-doctors-must-speak-out-on-gun-violence-because-it-is-our-lane/] , Toronto-based trauma surgeon</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ahead of a federal election, what road will Conservatives take on immigration?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“With the emergence of Maxime Bernier’s party and the success of the CAQ, some variation [of what’s happening in Europe and the U.S.] is here today. The question is whether Canada’s case of xenophobic populism will be a mild one that inoculates us against a more virulent strain, or whether it will take hold and change the norms of our political culture in a deeper way. To some extent, this will be up to Andrew Scheer himself: Will he compete with Bernier for anti-immigration votes and expand the issue’s place in our political discourse? Or will he follow the model of the early Harper years, when the Conservatives used pocketbook issues and selected socially conservative messages to connect with new Canadians? His answer will affect his party’s fortunes – and likely have a powerful effect on Canadian political culture for years to come.” – Michael Adams[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/opinion/article-ahead-of-a-federal-election-what-road-will-conservatives-take-on/] , president of the Environics Institute and author of Could It Happen Here?

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Sound of Music debuts on Broadway</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nov. 16, 1959: Barbie dolls, Ben-Hur and Mercury Seven astronauts – in 1959, these were a few of our favourite things. Another one? The Sound of Music, a bountiful 1938-set drama about fleeing from Nazis and the love of singing that went straight from Broadway’s Lunt-Fontanne Theatre to a show-tune-loving public’s heart. The Sound of Music used the Maria von Trapp memoir The Story of the Trapp Family Singers as its source book. Lyrics came from Oscar Hammerstein II, with music by Richard Rodgers. On stage as the young Austrian governess was Mary Martin, described in a <span class="companylink">New York Times</span> review as possessing a common touch, glowing personality and a “plain voice that makes music sound intimate and familiar.” Familiar indeed: Selections including My Favorite Things and the theme song became standards, while sing-along screenings of the beloved 1965 film adaptation starring Julie Andrews and Christopher Plummer are popular to this day. The Alpine-based musical itself faced no uphill battle at the 1960 Tony Awards, where it captured five prizes. Sadly, The Sound of Music was the last musical written by Rodgers and Hammerstein; the latter died of stomach cancer nine months after the Broadway debut. – Brad Wheeler</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">PERFORMANCE OVERVIEW AND OUTLOOK</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On August 29, 2018, the Company announced that a special committee of the board of directors (the “Committee”) has been established to consider potential strategic alternatives available to Strategic. The Committee is comprised of substantially all of the independent directors of the Company. In conjunction with the special alternatives process, Strategic received an offer to restructure and provide additional capital to the Company as outlined below.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Potential recapitalization transactions</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On November 5, 2018, Strategic announced that the Company’s controlling shareholders (the “GMT Funds”) signed a letter of intent to: (i) provide a loan to the Company of up to $30 million and (ii) to settle their existing convertible debentures of the Company by way of a shares for debt settlement agreement (collectively, “the Recapitalization Transactions”). In addition, certain other holders of convertible debentures have also agreed to settle their existing convertible debentures on the same terms as the GMT Funds. Strategic has entered into shares for debt settlement agreements with holders of 96% of the existing convertible debentures.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The loan by the GMT funds and certain other investors into Strategic is expected to take the form of: (i) a first tranche of $15 million in 1.5 year first lien secured notes bearing interest at 12% per annum and payable quarterly; and (ii) a second $15 million tranche of notes on the same terms as the first tranche (the second tranche being callable by the Company on the occurrence of certain events).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In consideration of the Investment, Strategic will issue to the GMT Funds $5 million of common share purchase warrants ("Bonus Warrants") for each tranche of the Investment, at a strike price equal to the 20 day volume weighted average trading price of the Common Shares as of the closing date of the Recapitalization Transactions for a period of 5 years. Strategic will also pay a financing origination fee to the GMT Funds in the amount of 2% of the total funds made available to Strategic. The parties have also agreed to a $3 million break fee if the Recapitalization Transactions are not completed as a result of Strategic sourcing an alternative financing structure prior to closing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pursuant to the shares for debt settlement agreements, Strategic has agreed to settle approximately $111 million of the $116 million of outstanding debentures (including current interest and notes issued in satisfaction of interest on a payment in kind basis) in exchange for approximately 1,443,452,300 common shares of the Company at a deemed price of $0.0773 per share. Assuming the conversion of all of the Company's outstanding convertible debentures, it is expected that current shareholders would own approximately 3% of the Company and former debenture holders would own approximately 97% of the post closing issued and outstanding common shares of Strategic.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is a condition of the Recapitalization Transactions that the remaining holders of convertible debentures are offered the opportunity to convert their debentures to common shares at the same conversion price and that a minimum of 98% of the principal amounts of the debentures are so converted.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Strategic’s new management team is encouraged by the additional investment provided by GMT funds and believes the Recapitalization Transactions significantly reduce the Company’s leverage and annual interest costs while providing new capital to continue the development of the Muskeg light oil resource.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">QUARTERLY SUMMARY</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">* Capital expenditures of $2.5 million were incurred in the quarter, including a plant turnaround at the 9-17 processing facility, minor pipeline upgrades and compression testing for the debottleneck project.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">* Revenues increased 4% from the third quarter of 2017 to $8.6 million for the period due to an increase in realized oil prices, which were partially offset by lower production. The average WTI oil price for the quarter was US $66.97/bbl. Revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2018 increased by 7% to $29.3 million compared to $27.5 million for the comparative period in 2017 due to an increase in realized oil prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">* Despite higher revenues, funds used in operations increased to $0.8 million for the quarter from $0.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2017. The increase was despite a substantial decrease in operating costs, and was related to cash interest paid on convertible debentures and higher royalty rates in 2018. Interest on the debentures was paid in kind in 2017.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">* Average production decreased 27% from the third quarter of 2017 to 1,739 boe/d for the third quarter of 2018 due to a slower pace of drilling activity, as only 2 Muskeg wells were drilled in 2018 compared to 5 wells drilled in the first half of 2017.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">* On July 30, 2018, the Company sold certain oil and gas assets in northern British Columbia and southern Alberta for a nominal consideration. The carrying value of the disposed assets was minimal, but decommissioning liabilities were reduced by $2.1 million and therefore a $2.0 million gain on sale was recorded in the current quarter.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Basis of PresentationThis discussion and analysis of Strategic’s oil and natural gas production and related performance measures is presented on a working-interest, before royalties basis. For the purpose of calculating unit information, the Company's production and reserves are reported in barrels of oil equivalent (boe) and boe per day (boed). Boe may be misleading, particularly if used in isolation. A boe conversion ratio for natural gas of 6 Mcf: 1 boe has been used, which is based on an energy equivalency conversion method primarily applicable at the burner tip and does not necessarily represent a value equivalency at the wellhead. As the value ratio between natural gas and crude oil based on the current prices of natural gas and crude oil is significantly different from the energy equivalency of 6:1, utilizing a conversion on a 6:1 basis may be misleading as an indication of value.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Non-GAAP MeasurementsThe Company utilizes certain measurements that do not have a standardized meaning or definition as prescribed by IFRS and therefore may not be comparable with the calculation of similar measures by other entities, including net debt, operating netback and funds from operations. Readers are referred to advisories and further discussion on non-GAAP measurements contained in the Company’s MD&A.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A lot of issues in public policy are bafflingly complex. They are not, to use a five-dollar word beloved of academics, monocausal. They’re hard to understand, harder to explain and hardest to fix.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The massive discount between the Western Canadian crude-oil price and the benchmark world price, a gap that is lifting billions of dollars out of the pockets of Albertan and Canadian taxpayers, and out of the Canadian economy, is not one of those issues.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hard to understand? Try easy to picture: Alberta is producing far more oil than the existing pipeline network can carry to markets beyond Alberta. Without enough pipe, it’s impossible to move that oil efficiently and cheaply, or at all.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hard to explain? Not really. A glut of oil, trapped in Alberta due to the lack of pipeline capacity, has led to a precipitous fall in the price of Canadian crude. It’s the market in action, or in this case, a broken market in action. On Thursday, the Western Canadian Select benchmark dipped below US$14, while the North American benchmark, West Texas Intermediate, traded above US$56.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hard to fix? No. It’s simple. To address the lack of pipelines, build more pipelines.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That’s exactly what Canada’s oil patch has been trying to do for the better part of a decade. The need for rising oil production to be met by increasing pipeline construction has been the industry’s constant refrain. This is not a case of the industry failing to plan; the industry has, for years, had plans for the needed pipelines, right down to the blueprints.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the oil industry has been left idling, looking to Ottawa and waiting for a regulatory green light that won’t abruptly flash amber or turn red.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some holdups are beyond Ottawa’s control, such as when the Barack Obama administration in Washington blocked the Keystone XL pipeline for political reasons. It has since been approved by U.S. President Donald Trump, though it’s once again delayed by reviews in lower U.S. courts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Most of this mess, however, is of Canada’s own creation. This is a self-inflicted wound.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And ultimate responsibility rests with Ottawa. More importantly, regardless of how you score the blame game, Ottawa is the only one that can fix this situation. Ottawa can’t control global oil prices or decisions made by other countries. But the federal government, and only the federal government, can decide the fate of major infrastructure projects crossing provincial boundaries.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Trudeau government did not create this fiasco all by itself. It inherited a stalled regulatory process. But it also contributed to the problem, notably by killing Northern Gateway, a pipeline to the Pacific coast that had received conditional approval from the <span class="companylink">National Energy Board</span>. The plan was for the slack to be taken up by federal go-ahead for expansion of the existing Trans Mountain pipeline.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Trans Mountain spent so much time in limbo that its owner, <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span>, lost interest in waiting and sold it to Ottawa. And then the courts said the previous years of environmental review and Indigenous consultation had been deficient, which has again shifted the project into park. It’s not clear what Ottawa’s timeline is for jumping through the regulatory and legal hoops, and getting construction started.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the meantime, the financial bloodletting goes on. It’s especially painful for the Alberta economy and the province’s treasury, but it’s hurting all Canadians.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The investment firm <span class="companylink">Peters & Co. Ltd</span>. estimates that if the gap between Canadian and American benchmark oil prices remains at US$40 next year, it will cost the Alberta treasury $5-billion in revenue, and the province $50-billion in economic activity. That will slow the entire country’s growth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last month, Alberta Premier Rachel Notley described Canadian oil exported at bargain-basement prices as “money being taken out of the Canadian economy and sucked into American bank accounts.” That’s about the shape of it. Canada is running a permanent Black Friday sale.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Desperate measures are being considered, with several oil companies this week asking Ms. Notley to issue an order temporarily forcing all producers in the province to lower their output, to try to raise prices. It’s an absurd and unsatisfactory solution to an absurd and unsatisfactory situation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The only long-term solution is for more pipeline capacity to come on-stream. And the one big missing piece is the Trans Mountain pipeline expansion. Your move, Ottawa.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Suncor has no exposure to the "differential" between Western Canadian Select bitumen-blend crude and New York-traded West Texas Intermediate and therefore shouldn't have to reduce its production, company spokeswoman Sneh Seetal said Thursday.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We upgrade or refine over 70 per cent of the barrels we produce in Alberta," she said. "Our position is that government intervention in the market would send the wrong signals to the investment community regarding doing business in Alberta and Canada.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"And we really do need to take a long-term view and allow the market to operate as it should."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Suncor believes it should be allowed to benefit from the refineries and upgraders it has built and the pipeline space it has contracted that insulate it from local price discounts, she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Husky also believes in a "market-based solution," spokeswoman Kim Guttormson wrote in an email.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Market intervention comes with an unacceptably high level of economic and trade risk," she said, adding the best option to reduce price discounts is to advance pipeline solutions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The province has called on Ottawa to help increase crude-by-rail shipments and unveiled Wednesday a "lost-revenue counter" to be displayed in Ottawa and track how much money Canadians are missing since the Trans Mountain pipeline expansion approval was overturned by the Federal Court of Appeal in August. It hasn't yet decided whether to restrict production.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The temporary cuts suggested by Cenovus and supported by some other producers of bitumen would work to clear clogged storage and quickly reduce price discounts on Alberta oil, to the benefit of the provincial treasury, Phil Skolnick, an analyst at Eight Capital Research, said in a report Thursday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Shut-in volumes would quickly alleviate the pain by freeing up export pipeline space and clearing out Alberta storage levels," he said, adding the province appears to have the right to make the move.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But he added that he expects discounts to moderate over the next few months as companies voluntarily reduce output, crude-by-rail exports rise, U.S. refineries come back on line after fall maintenance shutdowns and the 80,000-barrel-per-day Sturgeon Refinery begins processing bitumen (likely by early next year) near Edmonton.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Skolnick estimates recent WCS-WTI heavy oil discounts, if held for a year, would equate to an Alberta royalty loss of about $4 billion, an oil industry-related Canadian federal income tax loss of about $13 billion and an annual U.S. federal income tax gain of about $12 billion from higher U.S. refining earnings (all figures in Canadian currency).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to Net Energy, the WCS-WTI differential was at US$42.95 on Thursday morning, a difference that means producers were getting about US$14 for each barrel of bitumen blend.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The discount versus WTI was also elevated for upgraded synthetic crude at US$31.55 per barrel and for Edmonton light oil at US$34.60.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Implied bitumen prices in Canada after subtracting the cost of the light oil diluent needed to allow it to flow in a pipeline are about 83 cents per barrel or about half the cost of a bottle of Diet Coke, RBC energy analyst Greg Pardy said in a note.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"By comparison, Mexican Maya (a comparable crude stream to WCS in terms of gravity and sulphur content) is capturing US$63 on the U.S. Gulf Coast ... This dynamic reflects the fact that Canada's depressed oil prices are heavily related to egress constraints," he wrote.</p>

Further, events or circumstances may cause actual results to differ materially from those predicted as a result of numerous known and unknown risks, uncertainties, and other factors, many of which are beyond the control of the Company, including, without limitation: whether the Company's exploration and development activities respecting its prospects will be successful or that material volumes of petroleum and natural gas reserves will be encountered, or if encountered can be produced on a commercial basis; the ultimate size and scope of any hydrocarbon bearing formations on its lands; that drilling operations on its lands will be successful such that further development activities in these areas are warranted; that Questerre will continue to conduct its operations in a manner consistent with past operations; results from drilling and development activities will be consistent with past operations; the general stability of the economic and political environment in which Questerre operates; drilling results; field production rates and decline rates; the general continuance of current industry conditions; the timing and cost of pipeline, storage and facility construction and expansion and the ability of Questerre to secure adequate product transportation; future commodity prices; currency, exchange and interest rates; regulatory framework regarding royalties, taxes and environmental matters in the jurisdictions in which Questerre operates; and the ability of Questerre to successfully market its oil and natural gas products; changes in commodity prices; changes in the demand for or supply of the Company's products; unanticipated operating results or production declines; changes in tax or environmental laws, changes in development plans of Questerre or by third party operators of Questerre's properties, increased debt levels or debt service requirements; inaccurate estimation of Questerre's oil and gas reserve and resource volumes; limited, unfavourable or a lack of access to capital markets; increased costs; a lack of adequate insurance coverage; the impact of competitors; and certain other risks detailed from time-to-time in Questerre's public disclosure documents. Additional information regarding some of these risks, expectations or assumptions and other factors may be found under in the Company's Annual Information Form for the year ended December 31, 2017 and other documents available on the Company’s profile at www.sedar.com[http://www.sedar.com]. The reader is cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Certain information set out herein with respect to forecasted results is "financial outlook" within the meaning of applicable securities laws. The purpose of this financial outlook is to provide readers with disclosure regarding the Company's reasonable expectations as to the anticipated results of its proposed business activities. Readers are cautioned that this financial outlook may not be appropriate for other purposes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Barrel of oil equivalent ("boe") amounts may be misleading, particularly if used in isolation. A boe conversion ratio has been calculated using a conversion rate of six thousand cubic feet of natural gas to one barrel of oil and the conversion ratio of one barrel to six thousand cubic feet is based on an energy equivalent conversion method application at the burner tip and does not necessarily represent an economic value equivalent at the wellhead. Given that the value ratio based on the current price of crude oil as compared to natural gas is significantly different from the energy equivalent of 6:1, utilizing a conversion on a 6:1 basis may be misleading as an indication of value.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Michael Binnion, President and Chief Executive Officer of Questerre, commented, “We were very pleased with the results from the first farm-in well at Kakwa North. The second well is being tested and a third farm-in well could spud early next year. By this time next year, we may see a similar ramp up in drilling to our adjacent Kakwa acreage.” He further added, “In advance of the 2019 drilling program at Kakwa, we recently completed most of the planned infrastructure expansion, almost doubling the capacity of the central processing and water storage facilities. This resulted in reduced third quarter production. Our current production is over 1,800 boe/d.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Commenting on its Quebec assets he noted, “We still plan to move forward in Quebec despite the previous Government’s decision to include the ban on hydraulic fracturing in the final regulations. Our optimism is based on the strength of our legal position and, more importantly, growing social acceptability.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He added, “At a court hearing early in the fourth quarter, the Superior Court justice agreed with the ‘high importance’ of the issues raised in our legal motion about the ultra vires actions of the past Government. We are now fast-tracked for a judicial review that will decide on permanently setting aside the fracking ban regulations. The hearing is scheduled for next February and we would expect a decision early in the spring. We are open to settling this legal proceeding with the new Government on a pragmatic basis that balances the legal issues and environmental protection.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Highlights</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">* Government of Quebec enacts Petroleum Resources Act and regulations</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">* Kakwa joint venture facilities expansion completed with gross capacity almost doubling to 43MMcf/d</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">* Kakwa North well tests at 2,900 boe/d and operator plans tie-in</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">* Average daily production of 1,414 boe/d for the quarter, impacted by the plant expansion, with adjusted funds flow from operations of $2.62 million Commenting on its oil shale project in Jordan, he added, “We have started the next phase of engineering. In addition to the long-life reserves with no real decline rate relative to shale oil and conventional production in North America, this project also benefits from upgrading and premium pricing to Brent. Following the results from the feasibility study by Hatch, we are looking at optimizing capital costs to improve returns for this multibillion-barrel deposit. We hope to begin negotiations with the Kingdom of Jordan for a concession agreement by year-end.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Volumes averaged 1,414 boe/d for the third quarter and 1,812 boe/d year to date compared to 1,643 boe/d and 1,270 boe/d for the same periods last year with production shut-ins this quarter longer than expected for infrastructure and other field work. Improved oil prices and higher volumes year to date contributed to adjusted funds flow from operations of $13.28 million for the nine months ended September 30, up from $4.23 million last year. Light oil and liquids represent almost 70% of corporate production volumes and the Company realized an average oil and liquids price of $74/bbl year to date.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Company reported a net loss of $2.02 million for the current quarter (2017: $2.64 million) and $1.39 million for the year to date (2017: $6.79 million).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Capital investment for the quarter focused primarily on Kakwa and totaled $6.08 million (2017: $4.91 million) and for the year to date period was $22.19 million (2017: $12.77 million).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The term "adjusted funds flow from operations" is a non-IFRS measure. Please see the reconciliation elsewhere in this press release.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This press release contains the terms “adjusted funds flow from operations” which is a non-GAAP term. Questerre uses this measure to help evaluate its performance.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As an indicator of Questerre’s performance, adjusted funds flow from operations should not be considered as an alternative to, or more meaningful than, cash flows from operating activities as determined in accordance with GAAP. Questerre’s determination of adjusted funds flow from operations may not be comparable to that reported by other companies. Questerre considers adjusted funds flow from operations to be a key measure as it demonstrates the Company’s ability to generate the cash necessary to fund operations and support activities related to its major assets.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CALGARY—Premier Rachel Notley said she's still looking at a “suite of options” to handle the ongoing oil price differential, including curtailing production in the province.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The steep discount on Canadian heavy crude oil compared to its American counterparts continues to hammer the domestic oil and gas industry. This differential has been blamed, in part, on issues transporting oil to market. In the past, Notley has called for revisions to Bill C-69 — which would replace the <span class="companylink">National Energy Board</span> and create a new Impact Assessment Agency — and construction of the Trans Mountain pipeline expansion project.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We know that we need to work very, very quickly to address it,” Notley told reporters in Calgary on Thursday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At an Oct. 22 meeting with energy executives, Bloomberg News reported that Notley heard proposals from several companies, including <span class="companylink">Nexen Energy ULC</span> and <span class="companylink">Canadian Natural Resources Ltd</span>., to force a temporary cut in oil production. The companies argued that this would allow a backlog of unshipped oil to be processed and potentially trigger a recovery in prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Several major oil companies, such as <span class="companylink">Suncor Energy Inc</span>., <span class="companylink">Husky Energy Inc</span>., and <span class="companylink">Imperial Oil Ltd</span>., are against the idea, Bloomberg News reported. The integrated operations of these companies, from production to refineries, cushion them from the differential's effects.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Both sides raise really good points. It's not an easy case,” Notley said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the premier stopped short of endorsing curtailment when asked by reporters on Thursday. She said it was part of a “suite of options” up for consideration, but wouldn't say whether her government is planning to enact it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“As things stand now … there is a lack of consensus in the industry about the best way forward,” Notley told reporters.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Building the Trans Mountain pipeline expansion project has been touted by Notley as the only long-term solution to the transportation problem. August's Federal Court of Appeal ruling has halted the project, although the <span class="companylink">National Energy Board</span> is currently redoing environmental assessments. It is expected to deliver its final report to the federal government in February.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A possible short-term solution floated by Notley to tackle the transportation issues — shipping more oil by rail — is still on the table. Notley said the province is partnering with the federal government on that, but did not give further details.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Regardless of how the government goes about handling the differential, Notley said it needs to be taken care of soon. She wouldn't give a precise timeline on when a solution would be announced, but said it could be within a matter of weeks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We can't have it racing out of the ground at $10 a barrel for a really long period of time because it's Albertans' resources, and we know we need to do better,” she said. “And so we will do whatever we can to do better.”</p>

Suncor has no exposure to the "differential" between Western Canadian Select bitumen-blend crude and New York-traded West Texas Intermediate and therefore shouldn't have to reduce its production, company spokeswoman Sneh Seetal said Thursday.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Operations Review</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Traverse's production averaged 452 BOE per day (54% oil and NGL) during the third quarter of 2018, a decrease of 13% from the second quarter of 2018. Production declined as no new production has been added in 2018 and low natural gas pricing resulted in the shut-in of natural gas wells throughout the quarter. Adjusted funds flow increased 35% from the second quarter of 2018 due mainly to an increase in realized oil and NGL prices. Capital expenditures in the third quarter related mainly to land acquisition and production testing and equipment at Chigwell.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At September 30, 2018 Traverse holds approximately 98,000 net acres in the Duvernay shale basin. Traverse's Duvernay oil well at Chigwell, placed on production in December 2017, has recovered 104,500 barrels of water to October 31, 2018, which is 40% of the fluids utilized during completion of the well. Water cuts remain unchanged and Traverse will continue to produce the well and evaluate results.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Early in the fourth quarter, as part of the strategy to optimize existing assets, Traverse performed several minor well operations to return previously suspended and shut-in wells to production. This included natural gas wells previously shut-in due to low natural gas pricing, which has improved for the winter heating season. The price environment for light oil has deteriorated substantially due to historically high differentials caused by lack of take away capacity and pipeline constraints. In this current oil price environment, industry activity and financing opportunities have been reduced. Traverse will continue to evaluate alternatives for Duvernay development and optimization of its asset base.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Undeveloped land holdings in Alberta at September 30, 2018 were 202,700 gross (202,100 net) acres. At September 30, 2018 the Company had a working capital deficiency of approximately $6.0 million and credit facilities of $9.0 million. The Company's 2018 capital budget has been reduced to $3.0 million while the assessment of assets and evaluation of the Chigwell Duvernay well continues.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Non-IFRS financial measures</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In this release references are made to certain financial measures such as “adjusted funds flow”, “adjusted funds flow per share” and “netback” which do not have standardized meanings prescribed by IFRS and therefore may not be comparable to the calculation of similar measures by other entities. Management uses certain industry benchmarks such as netbacks to analyze financial and operating performance. There are no comparable measures in accordance with IFRS for operating or corporate netback. Management believes that in addition to net income (loss), the non-IFRS measures set forth below are useful supplemental measures as they assist in the determination of the Company's performance, leverage and liquidity. Investors should be cautioned however, that these measures should not be construed as an alternative to both net income (loss) and cash from operating activities, which are determined in accordance with IFRS, as indicators of the Company's performance.</p>

</pre>
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Adjusted funds flow per share is calculated based on the weighted average number of common shares outstanding consistent with the calculation of net income (loss) per share. Operating and corporate netbacks are also presented. Operating netback represents revenue less royalties, operating and transportation costs. Corporate netback represents the operating netback less general and administrative expenses and finance income and expense before accretion. Netback per BOE is the applicable netback divided by barrels of oil production for the applicable period. The calculation of Traverse's operating and corporate netbacks are detailed under the applicable headings within the Company’s management’s discussion and analysis for the period ended September 30, 2018.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">BOE equivalent</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The term “BOE” or barrels of oil equivalent may be misleading, particularly if used in isolation. A BOE conversion ratio of six thousand cubic feet of natural gas to one barrel of oil equivalent (6 Mcf: 1 bbl) is based upon an energy equivalency conversion method primarily applicable at the burner tip and does not represent value equivalency at the wellhead. Additionally, given that the value ratio based on the current price of crude oil, as compared to natural gas, is significantly different from the energy equivalency of 6:1, utilizing a conversion ratio of 6:1 may be misleading as an indication of value.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. stock futures were weaker early Thursday as the pound sank and European markets struggled following the departure of Britain’s chief Brexit negotiator and a number of others less than a day after the draft Brexit agreement was unveiled, casting fresh uncertainty over the process. On Bay Street, TSX futures gave up early gains to dip below break even with crude prices stabilizing somewhat after days of losses.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">World markets had appeared relatively calm overnight with Asia mostly higher on news that China and the United States appeared to be making progress on trade talks. Reuters reports that China has delivered a written response to U.S. demands for wide-ranging trade reforms.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">However, the fast-moving situation in Britain - a total of four government ministers resigned Thursday over the draft Brexit agreement - threw a wrench into the mix, with European shares reversing early gains. The British pound looked headed for its second biggest drop this year amid mounting opposition to the plan. In early trading, the pound fell 1.7 per cent, before trimming some of the losses. Demand for safe-haven German bonds also rose on the latest developments with yields on the ten-year note falling more than three basis points to the lowest levels in more than two weeks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">British Prime Minister Theresa May said her government is continuing to prepare for a no-deal Brexit in the wake of the latest resignations. “We have been preparing for no-deal and we continue to prepare for no-deal because I recognize that we have a further stage of negotiation with the European council and then that deal when finalized ... has to come back to this House,” she told parliament.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“It is turning into one of those mornings,” Chris Beauchamp, chief market strategist at IG, said. "As the steady drip of resignations hits the government, the U.K.’s deal with the <span class="companylink">EU</span> appears to be dead in the water already. Ministers now appear to be resigning at a steady pace, and at this rate the statement to the House today may not even happen."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He said risk appetite has take a hit across the board with the Brexit breakdown coinciding with Italy’s standoff with the <span class="companylink">European Union</span> and investor worries that "the great boom in tech earnings has come to an end.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On the corporate front, investors in North American get more retail earnings with the release of results from <span class="companylink">Walmart</span> and <span class="companylink">JC Penney</span>. <span class="companylink">Walmart</span> posted adjusted earnings per share[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/business/article-walmart-beats-sales-estimates-boosted-by-growth-in-online-business/] in the latest quarter of US$1.08, compared with analysts' forecasts of earnings of US$1.01. Revenue, however, came in at US$124.89-billion, just below forecasts which called for US$125.55. The retailer also raised its full-year earnings and U.S. same-store sales forecasts. <span class="companylink">Walmart</span> shares were up slightly in premarket trading.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Overseas, European markets remained mixed in morning trading amid the slew of Brexit resignations. The pan-European STOXX 600 was down 0.44 per cent at last check, off the morning lows. A weaker pound helped prop up the FTSE, which was trading just above break even. Financial stocks fell on news of U.K. Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab’s resignation. Germany’s DAX eked out gains of 0.14 per cent while France’s CAC 40 slipped 0.23 per cent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Asian markets, meanwhile, ended Thursday mostly higher, helped by easing trade tensions between the United States and China. Japan’s Nikkei ended off 0.2 per cent. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng added 1.75 per cent with shares of Tencent rising more than 5 per cent on stronger-than-forecast earnings. The Shanghai Composite Index finished up 1.36 per cent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Commodities</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Crude prices were mostly stable early Thursday after losing about 7 per cent over the previous three sessions with market oversupply concerns persisting despite growing expectations that <span class="companylink">OPEC</span> could cut output. Brent crude was slightly higher ahead of the North American open, trading in a day range of US$65.77 to US$66.72. West Texas Intermediate was trading just south of break even and had a range for the day so far of US$55.59 to US$56.49.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Reports earlier this week suggested <span class="companylink">OPEC</span> is weighing a production cut of as much as 1.4 million barrels a day next year to head off market oversupply. However, the Paris-based <span class="companylink">International Energy Agency</span> also cautioned that a significant surplus is likely for at least the first half of next year as a result of growth of non-OPEC production and slower demand from major consumers like China and India.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Oil is trading lower again on Thursday after a brief bounce in the middle of the week as we await the latest inventory figures from [the <span class="companylink">U.S. Energy Information Administration</span>].” <span class="companylink">OANDA</span> analyst Craig Erlam said. “API [the <span class="companylink">American Petroleum Institute</span>] reported another huge build on Wednesday which just further feeds the bearish sentiment right now and confirmation of this today could be the trigger for more downside, despite <span class="companylink">OPEC</span>’s best efforts to provide verbal support.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Erlam said that 'actions speak louder than words" and <span class="companylink">OPEC</span> and related producers will have to offer a significant output cut at next month’s meeting if they want to halt the current decline in prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In other commodities, gold prices were mostly steady as the U.S. dollar rose amid the current Brexit turmoil. Spot gold was unchanged at US$1,211.21 per ounce in morning trading after rising 1 per cent on Wednesday. U.S. gold futures were also slightly higher.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Silver prices rose 0.1 per cent at US$14.15 an ounce in morning trading in Europe.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Currencies and bonds</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Canadian dollar was slightly higher early Thursday as its U.S. counterpart gained against world currencies and the British pound sold off amid Brexit turmoil. The range on the loonie so far is a relatively narrow 75.48 US cents to 75.69 US cents. The Canadian dollar has found some support in the steadying of crude prices after sharp declines earlier this week. Sue Trinh, RBC’s head of Asia FX strategy, also notes that demands by U.S. democrats for changes to the USMCA trade agreement have also weighed on the loonie. She says the day’s main economic release - October existing home sales - is second-tier and likely won’t have much market impact.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In world currencies, uncertainty around Brexit resulted in the U.S. dollar index, which weighs the greenback against a group of world currencies, rise by about half a per cent to 97.268. The safe-haven yen also found some support from the latest headlines, rising 0.2 per cent against the U.S. dollar and 0.3 per cent against the euro.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The news wasn’t so good for the British pound, which fell as much as 1.7 per cent against the U.S. dollar to below US$1.27 following the spate of Brexit-related resignations. The pound fell about 1.5 per cent against the euro. As the morning wore on, the pound pared some of the early losses but remained sharply weaker.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I don’t expect any easing up in sterling volatility today, with the resignations potentially coming thick and fast,” Mr. Erlam said. “[Britain’s work and pensions minister] Esther McVey has already added her name to the list of ministers resigning and there are reports that many more could follow, which will just pile further pressure on the currency and the Prime Minister. If the pound breaks US$1.27 against the dollar, things could get very messy indeed.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In bonds, yields on <span class="companylink">U.S. government</span> debt ticked lower. The yield on the 10-year note was lower at 3.107 per cent. The yield on the 30-year note was also lower at 3.353 per cent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Stocks set to see action</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Canada’s <span class="companylink">Canfor Corp</span>. said Thursday it has struck a deal to buy 70 per cent of Sweden’s Vida Group for $580-million. Vida is Sweden’s biggest privately owned sawmill company. “With the acquisition of VIDA, we are excited to become a truly international manufacturer and provider of wood product solutions for our global customers,” said Don Kayne, President and Chief Executive Officer of Canfor. “This transformational growth will allow Canfor to further diversify and secure a worldwide fibre supply to meet the growing demand of our customers for high quality wood products.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Globe’s Andrew Willis reports that <span class="companylink">Callidus Capital Corp</span>. continues to lose money[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/business/article-callidus-loss-widens-as-new-leaders-take-the-helm-at-distressed-lender/] and set aside provisions for bad loans as new management take the wheel at the distressed lender, which is controlled by financier Newton Glassman. Toronto-based Callidus lost $20.4-million in the most recent quarter, the company announced late Wednesday, up from a loss of $17.6-million in the same period a year ago and its eighth consecutive quarterly loss.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">J.C. Penney Co Inc</span>’s quarterly comparable-store sales fell well short of analysts’ estimates, as the department store chain was forced to offer more discounts in the fight to keep customers from defecting to online stores. The retailer said Thursday sales at stores open for at least 12 months fell 5.4 per cent in the third quarter ended Nov. 3. Wall Street analysts on average had expected a 0.61 per cent decline, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. Its net loss widened to US$151-million or 48 US cents per share, from US$125-million or 40 US cents per share a year earlier. <span class="companylink">J.C. Penney</span> also withdrew its annual earnings forecast, to give its new chief executive officer and interim chief financial officer more time to assess the business. Shares of the retailer were down 12 per cent in premarket trading.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ford Motor Co chief executive Jim Hackett told Reuters the automaker is open to investment by automakers and others in its autonomous vehicle business, but cautioned that expanding partnerships with German automaker <span class="companylink">Volkswagen AG</span> is a “delicate dance.” <span class="companylink">Volkswagen</span>’s supervisory board is scheduled to meet on Thursday to review a 10-year strategic plan assembled by Chief Executive Herbert Diess that is expected to propose using alliances with rivals to cut development costs for electric and autonomous vehicles and potentially other types of vehicles. <span class="companylink">Ford</span> and VW have acknowledged they are in discussions. Mr. Hackett said on Wednesday a previously announced partnership to share development of future light commercial vehicles is “going better than we thought it would.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Austria’s AMS, which makes facial recognition technology, became the latest Apple supplier to cut its revenue forecast, adding to growing evidence that the latest iPhones are not selling well. The Swiss-listed group cut its fourth-quarter revenue outlook by 15 per cent and pushed back its medium-term targets, blaming “recent demand changes from a major customer.” AMS, which specializes in sensors, did not name Apple as the customer, but analysts estimate that the U.S. giant accounts for 40 percent of the Austrian group’s sales.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tencent beat third-quarter profit forecasts on Wednesday but gave no update on a regulatory block in China, the world’s largest gaming market, that has damaged its core business. China has imposed tougher rules on the gaming industry, including a halt to new game approvals as part of a regulatory overhaul and calls to tackle addiction among young people. Tencent, China’s biggest gaming and social media group, said profit in the July-September quarter rose by 30 percent to 23.3 billion yuan, beating an average analyst estimate of 19.32 billion yuan, thanks largely to investment gains.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Globe’s Shawn McCarthy reports that one of Canada’s largest oil companies is urging the Alberta government[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/business/article-cenovus-urges-alberta-to-order-crude-production-cut-to-halt-falling/] to intervene directly in the market to cut the province’s crude production and boost severely depressed prices. <span class="companylink">Cenovus Energy Inc</span>. chief executive Alex Pourbaix said the province is facing a “wholesale economic catastrophe” that justifies the government departing from free-market principles and ordering companies to reduce their production of oil.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">Dell Technologies</span> on Thursday raised its offer to buy back shares tied to its interest in software maker VMWare to $120 per share from its previous offer of $109, still way short of the $300 price suggested by activist investor Carl Icahn. The computer maker in July offered to pay US$21.7-billion in cash and stock to buy back shares tied to its interest in VMware, returning the computer maker to the stock market without an initial public offering.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">Cisco Systems Inc</span>. shares were up more than 4 per cent in the premarket after the company beat analysts’ estimates for quarterly revenue and profit on Wednesday, as the network gear maker benefited from demand for its routers and switches as well as growth in newer areas of focus such as software.</p>

Renovations at the building when Ms. Payette took office in 2017 meant her living quarters weren’t ready for her right away, and she stayed in the nearby 7 Rideau Gate, a house used to host visiting dignitaries. When Rideau Hall became available again, Ms. Payette wasn’t in a rush to move back in. Now sources tell The Globe she will finally return to the traditional home of the G-G next summer.</p>

(TSX: HWO) (“High Arctic” or the “Corporation”) is pleased to announce that it has made the necessary filings and received the necessary approvals to conduct a normal course issuer bid (“NCIB”) through the facilities of the Toronto Stock Exchange (“TSX”).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The TSX has accepted the Corporation’s notice to conduct the NCIB to purchase outstanding common shares on the open market, in accordance with the rules of the TSX. As approved by the TSX, the Corporation is authorized to purchase up to 2,700,386 common shares, representing approximately 10% of the public float of High Arctic, being 27,003,864 as of November 12, 2018. As of November 12, 2018 there were 51,176,765 common shares outstanding. The maximum number of common shares that High Arctic may purchase on any given day is 9,544 common shares, which is 25% of the Corporation’s average daily trading volume on the TSX for the previous six months. High Arctic may also make one weekly block repurchase which exceeds the daily limit subject to prescribed rules. All common shares acquired under the NCIB will be cancelled.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Corporation is authorized to make purchases during the period from November 19, 2018 to November 18, 2019, or until such earlier time as the NCIB is completed or terminated at the option of the Corporation. Any common shares the Corporation purchases under the NCIB will be purchased on the open market through the facilities of the TSX or alternative Canadian markets, at the prevailing market price at the time of the transaction. The Corporation has appointed National Bank Financial as its broker to conduct the NCIB transactions under an automatic purchase plan agreement (“APPA”) dated November 14, 2018. The APPA will allow National Bank Financial to purchase common shares under the bid during internal blackout periods when the Corporation would normally not be permitted to trade in its shares. Such purchases will be at the sole discretion of National Bank Financial based on direction received from High Arctic prior to any blackout period and in accordance with all regulatory and securities law.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Management of the Corporation believes that from time to time the market price of the High Arctic common shares may not reflect their underlying value and that, at such times, the purchase of common shares for cancellation will increase the proportionate interest of, and be advantageous to, all remaining shareholders. In addition, the purchases by High Arctic under the NCIB may increase liquidity to the Corporation’s shareholders wishing to sell their common shares. The Corporation’s previous NCIB expired on September 18, 2018 and under that program, a total of 2,227,774 common shares at a weighted average price of $3.94 per share have been repurchased for cancellation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">About High Arctic</p>

The Corporation’s principal focus is to provide drilling and specialized well completion services, equipment rentals and other services to the oil and gas industry.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mayor Naheed Nenshi said[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/canada/alberta/article-olympic-bids-demise-creates-roadblock-for-calgarys-infrastructure/] now that billions of dollars in federal and provincial funds are off the table, planned construction of 1,800 affordable housing units is in question. Also in jeopardy is the city’s long-awaited plan for a fieldhouse with running tracks and other facilities, with some councillors saying they don’t expect it to go forward in an era of austerity. Nenshi, who supported the Olympic bid, said Ottawa’s decision to delay its funding announcement until two weeks before the plebiscite may have contributed to the No result.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Here’s the view from Gary Mason[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/opinion/article-calgarians-rejected-a-deeply-flawed-olympic-bid/] : “Maybe the Olympics would have been the catalyst to ignite economic activity in Calgary, but maybe not, too. Unemployment is at 8 per cent. Roughly 25 per cent of downtown offices sit vacant. Oil prices in the province are at historic lows. There is no immediate end in sight to the pain the city is experiencing. But Calgarians are a practical lot. They are generally allergic to flimflam, and I think many felt that with this bid they were being asked to support a deeply flawed plan that didn’t add up in the end.” (for subscribers)</p>

Sterilization involves tubal ligations, the severing, burning or tying of the fallopian tubes that carry eggs from the ovaries to the uterus. An Indigenous law firm is currently planning to raise the issue in tandem with <span class="companylink">Amnesty International Canada</span> at a <span class="companylink">United Nations</span> committee next week. The firm is also leading a proposed class-action suit against health regions across Saskatchewan, along with the federal and Saskatchewan governments.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With its 89th homicide victim of the year, Toronto matched an all-time high set in 1991</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The death of 22-year-old Yohannes Brhanu in a late-night shooting yesterday marked the 89th homicide[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/canada/toronto/article-toronto-ties-homicide-record-with-89th-victim-of-the-year/] in Toronto this year. The last time that total was reached was in 1991, which police attribute to a gang war that was being waged across the city. But what’s happening today is less clear, police say. A major concern is “people just shooting and killing the first person they see in a rival neighbourhood, whether it’s a rival gang member or not,” Toronto Detective Sergeant Hank Idsinga said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some shootings have taken place in high-traffic downtown areas during busy times, in turn prompting calls for stronger rules to address gun violence. Mayor John Tory wants to see a ban on handguns and assault weapons, which is currently being considered by the federal government.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What has Germany really learned – and remembered – from Kristallnacht?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last week, Germany memorialized the 80th anniversary of Kristallnacht – ‘the night of broken glass’ – during which 1,400 synagogues and innumerable Jewish businesses throughout the country were vandalized. … On the anniversary last week, Ms. Merkel delivered a powerful address in a reconstructed synagogue in Berlin. She decried the ‘worrying’ rise of anti-Semitism in her country. She called for the safeguarding of protective institutions and the liberal values that underpin them. And she asked the seminal question we once thought we had answers to, but has since become ambiguous: ‘What did we really learn from the Shoah, this rupture of civilization?’” –  Erna Paris [https://www.theglobeandmail.com/opinion/article-what-has-germany-really-learned-and-remembered-from-kristallnacht/] , author of Long Shadows: Truth, Lies and History</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“These are incredibly strange times, and if you still aren’t convinced, consider this: Axl Rose has been lecturing the President of the United States about climate change. … Many Guns N’ Roses songs are undeniable jams, and much of Axl’s history is undeniably gross. It would be easy to assume he’d be a Trump supporter: His 1988 song One in a Million has vicious lyrics targeting immigrants, black people and gay men, right in line with the President’s agenda. The band’s catalogue is full of misogyny, too, and it’s impossible to put space between the musician and his lyrics. … It’s a past that would be hard to redeem, but oh, I want to believe. The roster of artists whose shady politics or blemished personal lives make it hard to enjoy their work grows endlessly, which is exhausting. Axl, at least, seems to have gotten smarter.” –  Denise Balkissoon [https://www.theglobeandmail.com/opinion/article-hearts-can-change-the-fragile-redemption-of-axl-rose/]

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Miller Reese Hutchison patents the electric hearing aid</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nov. 15, 1901: Miller Reese Hutchison had always wanted to help a friend who lost his hearing after a bout of scarlet fever. The key came with Alexander Graham Bell’s invention of the telephone in 1876. Earlier hearing aids, such as ear “trumpets,” were rudimentary things, but Bell’s invention provided a model for how to alter the volume and frequency of acoustic signals. Hutchinson’s invention, dubbed the Akouphone, was patented on Nov. 15, 1901. It consisted of a receiver, similar to that of a telephone, which was held to the ear, and a battery pack roughly the size of a portable radio. It proved a hit with Princess Alexandra of Denmark, who had had impaired hearing since infancy. She was so pleased with it that she invited Hutchinson to the coronation of her husband, Edward VII, when he was crowned King of the United Kingdom in 1902. She used the device throughout the ceremony, and presented Hutchinson with a medal afterward. Hutchinson would go on to patent other inventions, including one for a car horn that, ironically, made a sound so loud that one U.S. federal judge called it “harsh, raucous and diabolical.” – Dave McGinn</p>

<span class="companylink">Canopy Growth Corp</span>., Canada's largest cannabis producer, saw its sales slide and its losses widen in the quarter that immediately preceded the launch of the legal recreational marijuana market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Shares in the grower based in Smiths Falls, Ont., plunged more than 10 per cent Wednesday after the company revealed a $330-million net loss on revenue of $23-million in the quarter ended Sept. 30, an 11-percent drop in revenue from the previous quarter.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Co-chief executive Bruce Linton said the company took a deliberately cautious approach to the legalization of recreational cannabis on Oct.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">17 – a tack that likely had a negative effect on sales. Just $700,000 of the company's quarterly revenue came from deliveries to the recreational market – to stock shelves ahead of legalization. Canopy said it prioritized wholesale shipments to markets in Alberta and Quebec, which have bricks-and-mortar retail outlets, over online-only operations such as Ontario. He said Canopy stocked retailers with mostly flower to start, before expanding to soft-gel capsules and now prerolled joints, a category that proved to be among the most popular with consumers in the early days of legalization.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The focus, Mr. Linton said, is on the long term.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We want to be like a sustaining, winning race rather than a flash out of the gate," he said on a call with analysts Wednesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Canopy is the third of the sector's largest firms to report earnings this week, joining <span class="companylink">Aurora Cannabis Inc</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">and <span class="companylink">Tilray Inc</span>. Together, the three companies – valued collectively at almost $30-billion – booked $66million in total revenue and operating losses of $353-million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Analysts had predicted that cannabis growers would sell more than they did in September to the recreational market, which launched two weeks after the reporting period ended. They expected Canopy to show revenue of as much as $91-million, according to a research note by <span class="companylink">Cowen Inc</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“It's the first [time] in our history that I'm aware of where we actually had a slowdown," Mr.Linton said, attributing the sales dip to lower medical sales in Canada and Germany. “But it was more of a distraction than a pattern."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Canopy's stock tumbled 10.9 per cent on Wednesday in New York, falling to US$34.30 a share.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Investors were dumping other pot stocks, too: <span class="companylink">Tilray</span> fell 8.3 per cent, Aurora's shares were down 8 per cent and <span class="companylink">Aphria Inc</span>. dropped 7.4 per cent Despite supply issues plaguing the industry as a whole, Canopy is not low on product. As of Sept. 30, its inventory levels grew to 31,214 kilograms of cannabis flower, 21,499 litres of oil and 1,497 kilograms of soft-gel pills. That inventory and large production footprint may put Canopy “ahead of many other licensed producers (LPs) in its ramp and ability to supply adult-use channels," analysts at <span class="companylink">BMO Nesbitt Burns Inc</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">wrote Wednesday. “We believe there is significant uncertainty for the industry's ramp schedules."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But accelerating for recreational sales and overseas expansion isn't coming cheap. Canopy posted operating losses of $215-million for the quarter. It took a net write-off of $16-million related to culling plants because it didn't have a processing licence at one of its facilities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Canopy is aiming to capture a 30-per-cent share of Canada's recreational market. “Now, it's crank time," Mr. Linton said. “And the provinces are starting to gain their momentum as well."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Jonathan Wright, president and CEO of NuVista Energy Ltd., said recent delays affecting the Trans Mountain expansion and the Keystone XL projects have amplified the growing investor sentiment that Canada is unable to develop its infrastructure.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“People are really starting to give up on Canada and it's because we can't get the pipelines built," Mr. Wright said in an interview Wednesday. Mr. Wright was one of several chief executives of energy producers who convened in Toronto on Wednesday for the GMP FirstEnergy Energy Symposium.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Brian Schmidt, president and CEO of Tamarack Valley Energy Ltd., acknowledges that a drop in the price of West Texas Intermediate has had an impact, but he blames red tape and pipeline delays for the lack of access to capital.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I can say this because we were restricted capital before the price of WTI oil fell and the Americans were not," Mr. Schmidt said in an interview.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While energy prices have begun to recover from the 2014-15 crash, Western Canadian producers have been forced to accept a steep discount for their crude. The lack of pipeline capacity combined with maintenance shutdowns at U.S. refineries have led to surpluses in Alberta, causing the gap between U.S. and Canadian benchmark oil to widen. That, in turn, has hurt the stock prices of Canadian energy producers and made it harder for them to access capital to finance growth, invest in technology or make acquisitions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Robert Fitzmartyn, head of energy institutional research at GMP, said those oil patch companies that have managed to do mergers and acquisitions have typically seen their stock prices slide significantly after announcing the deal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That effectively amounts to investors punishing companies for doing what they are supposed to be doing – acquiring assets at the low point of the cycle, when prices are comparatively cheap.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Investors are uncertain because, right now, fundamentals don't matter," Mr. Fitzmartyn said. “It's preventing activity that otherwise should be going on."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As for commodity swings, Tamarack's Mr. Schmidt said producers are used to them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We get it, and we live by it and we control our spending by it and our capital allocation is judged by it," Mr. Schmidt said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“But when you have a [West Texas Intermediate] price and you pile on a US$30 differential, that differential is self-inflicted. That's something that Canada is doing to its own industry because of its lack of infrastructure."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Schmidt is hoping for a strategic plan from the federal government to rectify the issue – one that could include legislating the Trans Mountain pipeline expansion project into action or reviving the cancelled Energy East pipeline project.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the past, energy producers were able to access capital instantly, NuVista's Mr. Wright said. “If you had a good play and good things to drill, everyone knew the demand would be there. That has almost completely dried up in the last year."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, oil sands giant <span class="companylink">Cenovus Energy Inc</span>. on Wednesday called for the Alberta government to invoke existing legislation and impose a broad-based cut in crude production in order to reduce the staggering discounts that companies are receiving for their oil.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Cenovus – which has announced its own temporary production cuts – did not provide an estimate of what would be required to rebalance the market. However, in a recent report, <span class="companylink">Peters & Co</span>. estimated that production would need to be at least 200,000 barrels a day fewer to support prices that have been driven lower by the lack of pipeline capacity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Calgary, federal Natural Resources Minister Amarjeet Sohi said he shares Albertans' “frustration" at billions of dollars being lost to the Canadian economy due to oil-price discounts linked to export pipeline capacity constraints. After a speech at an energy forum, Mr. Sohi told reporters the key to building pipelines is building trust in regulatory processes and engaging affected parties early on so that approvals aren't overturned, as was the case with Trans Mountain.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">Cenovus Energy Inc</span>. chief executive Alex Pourbaix said the province is facing a “wholesale economic catastrophe" that justifies the government departing from free-market principles and ordering companies to reduce their production of oil.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Any move by Alberta to enact limits on the amount oil producers can send to market would mark a strategic shift in a province that has long promoted free enterprise and open competition among players in its most important sector. But some say the current industry crisis calls for emergency measures.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We really are in the middle of a full-blown economic crisis," Mr.Pourbaix said in a telephone interview from Calgary on Wednesday. “I don't take any pleasure in suggesting we should have government intervention, but we are dealing with a complete failure of the market."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Oil companies in Alberta need to get initial regulatory approval for projects, but actual production is not regulated. The industry has been reeling in recent months from the shortage of pipeline capacity, which has resulted in inventories building up and prices slumping when compared with the North American benchmark, West Texas Intermediate (WTI).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Keystone XL pipeline – which was approved by U.S. President Donald Trump in early 2017 – remains stalled as a result of court challenges in the United States.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The federal Liberal government approved the Trans Mountain pipeline expansion project in late 2016, but is now trying to get it back on track after the federal court quashed the approval.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Western Canadian heavy crude is typically discounted about US$15 a barrel compared with WTI, but that discount has grown to more than US$40 this fall. And over the past two weeks, oil prices in general have been declining. With that recent drop in WTI, Alberta oil is now selling for less than US$15 a barrel.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Alberta government is consulting with industry leaders and “not ruling out any options," a spokeswoman for Premier Rachel Notley said on Wednesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The oil-price differential right now is absurd, and exactly why Premier Rachel Notley is fighting to build new pipelines and pushing Ottawa to step up and help fix the backlog in rail shipments," Cheryl Oates, the Premier's director of communications, said in an e-mail. Within the last month, Ms. Notley has urged the federal government to purchase rail cars that could be used for oil exports.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Pourbaix said the province, as the owner of the resources the companies are extracting, has the legislated authority to order them to cut their production. The power was used in the 1980s by then-premier Peter Lougheed during the province's dispute with Ottawa over the National Energy Policy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a report released Monday, Calgary-based investment company <span class="companylink">Peters & Co. Ltd</span>. said if heavy-oil discounts remain at US$40 through 2019, the province will lose $50-billion in economic activity and the provincial government will lose $5-billion in revenue. (The provincial government's budget is roughly $50-billion.) Cenovus has announced its own temporary production cuts of up to 50,000 barrels a day. However, the CEO said some competitors who have large refining operations are making significant profits from the depressed crude prices and, therefore, have little incentive to cut production.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While he did not mention company names, both <span class="companylink">Suncor Energy Corp</span>. and <span class="companylink">Imperial Oil Ltd</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">own refineries that profit from lower-priced crude.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Suncor maintains that it has invested billions of dollars in Alberta to process oil sands bitumen and is now benefiting from that strategy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The company opposes the government action Cenovus is urging.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Government intervention in a market would send the wrong signals to the investment community regarding doing business in Alberta and Canada," Suncor spokeswoman Sneh Seetal said in an e-mail.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We need to take a long-term view and allow the market to operate as it should. There are already indications that the market is working."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Pourbaix did not give a precise estimate of how much production would have to be curtailed but noted the analyst reports put the figure at between 200,00 and 300,000 barrels a day.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Oil production from Western Canada is expected to average close to 4.5 million barrels a day this month, according to the <span class="companylink">National Energy Board</span>. That's up by some 350,000 barrels a day from the beginning of the year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Pourbaix said he believes that price discounts will slowly shrink through 2019 as more rail capacity comes on stream and, late in the year, when <span class="companylink">Enbridge Inc</span>. completes the expansion of its main export pipeline to the United States.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Asked whether Ottawa should take emergency measures to deal with the crisis, the Cenovus executive said the federal government should focus on getting the Trans Mountain pipeline expansion back on track and completed as quickly as possible.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">Peters & Co. Ltd</span>. report said producers have already cut production by some 200,000 barrels a day for November and December.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The Alberta government has a lot at stake with the wide differentials and should be motivated to improve the situation in the near term," it said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Various companies – led by <span class="companylink">Imperial Oil</span> – are planning to increase crude-by-rail capacity in the coming months. But the <span class="companylink">Peters & Co</span>. report said expectations of an additional 150,000 barrels a day by the middle of next year are likely overly optimistic.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">However, the Alberta government would face enormous challenges if it attempted to take up Cenovus's call for direct intervention, said Warren Mabee, director of Queen's University's Institute for Energy and Environmental Policy. Companies that are profiting from the lower crude prices would oppose the action, as would some producers who might feel they were being shortchanged by the government, Prof.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mabee said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the same time, any provincial action to reduce production and prop up prices would likely trigger a response from the United States, where refineries and consumers have been the beneficiaries of the lower prices, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Trump this week criticized Saudi Arabia for planning to cut production in response to falling global crude prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Under the current North American free-trade agreement, the intervention suggested by Cenovus could trigger retaliation from the Americans, Prof. Mabee added.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CALGARY, Alberta, Nov. 14, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- <span class="companylink">NXT Energy Solutions Inc</span>. ("NXT" or the "Company") (TSX: SFD; OTC QB: NSFDF) today announced the Company's financial and operating results for the quarter-ended September 30, 2018. All dollar amounts herein are in Canadian Dollars.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q3 Financial and Operating Highlights</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Key financial and operational highlights for the third quarter of 2018 include:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">• Following the Company’s participation at the Upstream West Africa Summit in Senegal in Q2, NXT management traveled twice to Africa to meet with representatives of the <span class="companylink">Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation</span> (“NNPC”) and the <span class="companylink">Ghana National Petroleum Corporation</span> (“GNPC”) to discuss the benefits SFD® would bring to their current exploration programs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">* Discussions with NNPC and GNPC have continued in the fourth quarter and NXT is providing SFD® due diligence material to facilitate their review of our technology for the potential utilization of SFD®. • In September we were invited by BGP Inc., a subsidiary of <span class="companylink">China National Petroleum Corporation</span>, to participate at its biannual “2018 BGP Technical Seminar” in Beijing, where over 200 industry experts came together. NXT has been in discussion with BGP executives and geoscientists for the last three years and has visited their respective headquarters. BGP also invited NXT to consider further business opportunities and has introduced NXT to their country managers. BGP operates in over 40 countries worldwide and is the largest seismic acquisition company in the world. NXT’s forward strategy is to secure SFD® contracts with BGP and its affiliates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">• As a result of recent political changes in the government of Sri Lanka, our contract negotiations have been put on hold. We will assess the situation as to when discussions can be renewed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">• Following the signing of a MOU between Generation Resource Discoveries (“GRD”), NXT’s regional representative, and the Government of Aceh, Indonesia on February 22, 2018, GRD has extended discussions, previously expected to conclude in August, to secure funding and the required permits for a geophysical survey over an area of up to 20,000 km2 in the North Sumatra basin offshore Aceh, Indonesia. NXT management is planning to join GRD for meetings during the fourth quarter with the aim of successfully concluding financing and permit discussions. Upon successful completion of both components, NXT will work with GRD to design an SFD® survey to be included as part of the larger geophysical survey.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">• NXT presented at the <span class="companylink">National Oil Company</span> Assembly held in Amsterdam during September, 2018 which has generated new interest from certain oil and gas companies in attendance at the conference. NXT is following up with these companies directly.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">• In September, 2018, NXT received a United States patent for its new sensor design we term the “Cascade” configuration.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">* The Cascade sensor is the result of NXT’s continued research & development efforts and builds upon our existing US patent. Management believes the Company’s Cascade sensors will provide enhanced ability for identifying trapped fluid bodies indicative of potential hydrocarbon accumulations along with improved reliability and flexibility during SFD® survey operations. • NXT completed a private placement financing on July 3, 2018 of $9,484,810 through the issuance of an aggregate of 10,264,946 units at $0.924 per unit, marginally less than the original target of $10,076,416 and the issuance of 10,905,212 units that was announced in the first quarter (the "Private Placement"). Each unit consists of one common share and one-third of one common share purchase warrant (each whole warrant, a "Warrant"), and each Warrant entitles the holder to acquire one common share at an exercise price of $1.20 for twelve (12) months from closing of the first tranche of the Private Placement on February 16, 2018.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">• NXT entered into an Investor Rights Agreement with Alberta Green Ventures Limited Partnership (the "Subscriber" or "AGV") in conjunction with the completion of the Private Placement. The Subscriber now holds approximately 20.0% of the Company’s 68,573,558 outstanding common shares (including common shares issuable through the exercise of its warrants).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">• No survey revenues were recorded for the first three quarters of 2018.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">• A net loss of $1.66 million was recorded for Q3-18, including amortization expense of $0.45 million and stock-based compensation expense of $0.11 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">• A net loss of $5.58 million was recorded for 2018 YTD, including amortization expense of $1.34 million and stock-based compensation expense of $0.56 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">• Operating activities used $1.60 million of cash during Q3-18 and net cash proceeds provided from financing activities was $0.81 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">• Losses per common share were $0.02 for Q3-18 and $0.09 for 2018 YTD (basic and diluted).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">• Operating activities used $4.88 million as at 2018 YTD and net cash from financing activities was $9.19 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">• General and administrative costs for 2018 YTD as compared to 2017 YTD have been reduced by $0.59 million or 16% mostly due to a reduction in headcount and partially offset by increased business development activity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">• Cash and short-term investments at the end of the Q3-18 were $5.41 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Message to Shareholders George Liszicasz, President, and CEO of NXT, commented, “NXT had a very busy third quarter pursuing a number of strategic contract opportunities. In addition, we made further advancements in our intellectual property protection and completed the final tranche of our Private Placement announced in February. I am confident that our efforts will materialize into future success.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Exploration interest has started to increase globally evidenced by significant number of countries announcing bid-rounds recently. Oil and gas companies globally, both NOC and international oil companies (“<span class="companylink">IOC</span>”), are being required to make strategic decisions on where to efficiently invest their resources. They require good quality prospect level data. SFD® is the only airborne tool that provides prospect level information and we are therefore engaged in discussions with NOCs and IOCs worldwide.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The need for larger finds and market instability have generated a significant interest in SFD® technology.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On behalf of our Board of Directors and the entire team at NXT, I want to thank all of our shareholders for their continued support. With all of the business development activity currently ongoing in NXT we are looking forward to 2019.” Summary highlights of NXT's 2018 third quarter financial statements (with comparative figures to 2017) are noted below.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CALGARY, Alberta, Nov. 14, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- <span class="companylink">Critical Control Energy Services Corp</span>. (TSX: CCZ; CCZ.PR.A) today reported its financial results for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Negative market sentiment in Canada and increased competitiveness in field services in the US continues to impact the Corporation’s growth ambitions,” said Alykhan Mamdani. “Management’s strategic response to increase focus on its core software in the US and newer offerings in Canada which provide material cost savings to producers are imperative to boost operating performance for the remainder of 2018 and into 2019.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Revenue</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">* Key strategic Cloud based software generated $1.9 million in the third quarter of 2018 consistent with the comparative period in 2017.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">* Software based services revenue decreased by 12.7% compared to the prior period comparison, due in large part to the nearing completion of a major implementation for one of the Corporation’s customers in Canada.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">* Measurement services revenue increased 6.3% compared to the prior period due to an increase in field service and certification work offsetting a decline in lab services.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">* Equipment and other revenue generated $1.0 million in the third quarter of 2018, over 90% of this revenue is based in the United States, it fluctuates from period to period depending on demand and is viewed as non-recurring in nature. Gross margin</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">* The Corporation achieved a gross margin of 41.2% in the third quarter of 2018 which is comprised of Software with a gross margin of 60.3% and Field Services with a gross margin of 17.7%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">* Gross margin in Software decreased from 63.1% to 60.3% in the third quarter of 2018, due to a strong competitive environment in Canada.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">* The Corporation continues to focus on restructuring its Field Services business and consolidating operations across the US. The implementation of these initiatives combined with reduced revenue contributed to a decreased gross margin of 17.7% in the third quarter of 2018 from 18.56% in the third quarter of 2017. Earnings and net earnings</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">* The Corporation’s loss was $13.1 million for the third quarter 2018, compared to $1.2 million in the third quarter of 2017. The increased loss is attributed to $8.5 million impairment of intangible assets and goodwill, $3.5 million derecognition of deferred income taxes, $0.6 million in other expenses related to termination benefits, restructuring costs, and refinancing charges incurred by the Corporation in the third quarter of 2018.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">* Adjusted EBITDA was $0.7 million for the third quarter of 2018 compared to $0.6 million in 2017. The increase from the prior comparative period of $0.1 million is attributed to reduced administrative expenditures offset by a decline in revenue. Outlook and Guidance</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The strengthening price of oil in early 2018 has created cautious optimism in the Corporation’s US client base but the lack of access to export markets in Canada continues to negatively impact investment in the Corporation’s largest revenue base.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As the industry struggled during the past three years, oil and gas service providers have become increasingly competitive materially driving down costs to the producer, which have materially impacted the Corporation’s revenue base. While the impact to the Corporation’s measurement services and software based services was felt the most, the value provided by the Corporation’s cloud based software generated modest growth, driven primarily through penetration of the Corporation’s software into the US market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Corporation’s strategy for Field Services in 2018 and onwards is to leverage its Field Services’ customers in the US to adopt the Corporation’s software. Instead of competing on price alone, the Corporation is rebuilding its Field Services business to differentiate an increasingly commoditized offering with cost savings based on adoption of software. Management is confident that this endeavour will yield growth in the Corporation’s strategic cloud based software revenue, but the effort is expected to continue to negatively impact the Corporation’s measurement services revenue in 2018 as the Corporation implements customers onto its cloud based software. Management’s expectation of growth is based upon continued penetration of the Corporation’s software by its US customers and may be impacted as the industry continues investment in automation attracting the entry of new competitive products to the Corporation’s software.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In May 2018, the Corporation completed a restructuring of its research and development department. The payment of these restructuring costs is expected to be substantially paid by the end of the fourth quarter of 2018, but were fully expensed in the second quarter of 2018. Subsequent to the end of Q3, 2018, the Corporation restructured its measurement business in the Southern United States, resulting in closure of its offices in Mounds, Oklahoma, Greenbriar, Arkansas and Cotulla, Texas. The impact of the closure of these offices and related staff is expected to increase earnings in 2019 and the associated costs will be expensed in fourth quarter of 2018.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The financial performance of the Corporation in 2018 has necessitated the refinancing of the Corporation’s secured debt with higher costs debt provided by a lender that specializes in higher leverage situations. The financing was completed on November 14, 2018. This has resulted in more flexible secured debt facilities, but at a materially increased cost. These increased costs will be necessary until the Corporation is able to improve its operational performance and the Corporation will continue to assess alternative financings solutions.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Suncor also announced today that the Toronto Stock Exchange (TSX) accepted a notice filed by Suncor of its intention to amend its existing normal course issuer bid (the NCIB) effective as of November 19, 2018 to purchase common shares through the facilities of the TSX, <span class="companylink">New York Stock Exchange</span> and/or alternative trading platforms. The notice provides that Suncor may increase the maximum number of common shares that may be repurchased in the period beginning May 4, 2018 and ending May 3, 2019 from approximately $2.15 billion, or approximately 3% of Suncor’s issued and outstanding common shares as at April 30, 2018, to approximately $3 billion, or approximately 5% of Suncor’s issued and outstanding common shares as at April 30, 2018. The decision to increase the NCIB was previously announced with Suncor's second quarter release on July 25, 2018. No other terms of the NCIB have been amended.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Between May 4, 2018 and November 13, 2018 and pursuant to the NCIB, Suncor has already repurchased approximately $1.98 billion of common shares on the open market. Pursuant to the NCIB (as amended), Suncor has agreed that it will not purchase more than 81,695,830 common shares, of which 39,101,184 common shares have already been purchased between May 4, 2018 and November 13, 2018.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The actual number of common shares that may be purchased and the timing of any such purchases will be determined by Suncor. Suncor believes that, depending on the trading price of its common shares and other relevant factors, purchasing its own shares represents an attractive investment opportunity and is in the best interests of the company and its shareholders. The company does not expect the decision to allocate cash to repurchase shares will affect its long-term growth strategy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">From November 14, 2017 to May 1, 2018, under Suncor’s previous normal course issuer bid, Suncor successfully completed the purchase of approximately $926 million worth of its common shares (20,936,298 common shares) at a weighted average price of $44.21 per common share.</p>

As many downtown towers sit empty, other Calgary businesses could end up picking up the tax tab[https://www.thestar.com/calgary/2018/10/25/as-many-downtown-towers-sit-empty-other-calgary-businesses-could-end-up-picking-up-the-tax-tab.html]
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mayor Naheed Nenshi said the reduction can partly be explained by intentional investment the city made after Alberta's economy soured.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“As part of our response to the economic downturn, and precisely because we had squirrelled money away in the good times, we were able to put a lot of money into the city economy over the last few years of economic downturn,” he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Now that we're in a different phase of economic recovery, there's less need for that. While there is far less capital spending going forward, excluding the Green Line ... that is from a stimulus high. We're moving to a more sustainable overall range of construction.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The budget also includes $82 million of one-time funds for items such as snow and ice removal services.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After Wednesday's public presentation, council will debate the budget details during the week of Nov. 26. The finalized budget will be approved once that discussion concludes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nenshi rejected the idea that the plan is an “austerity budget,” as some city councillors have termed it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“This is a budget that invests in stuff people have told us is important to them while holding the line, as we always do, on taxes — ensuring our taxes remain the lowest in the country for our residences.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">TRANSIT</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The city's transit system is expected to face more riders over the next four years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Budget documents outline plans to expand bus rapid transit (BRT) service — a previously approved capital project — as well as service to newer Calgary communities. Designing and constructing the Green Line expansion is also a goal for the city over the next four years, although it'll need further capital. But while public transit will see noticeable increases to its operating budget — 10 per cent in 2019, and 3 per cent for subsequent years — it'll see a reduction to capital funding.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">All Calgary Transit fare categories would climb somewhat in price between 2019 and 2022, according to budget documents. An adult single ride would be $3.40 by 2019 and eventually rise to $3.75 by 2022. Meanwhile, seniors' passes will go from $135 a year to $155 by the end of the four-year budget cycle, and the U-Pass would rise by $20 between 2019 and 2022 for both the fall and winter semesters.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Low-income transit passes will see slight increases in price — no more than $1.50 — in 2019 under the budget, but will depend on sliding-scale program funding, according to budget documents.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Buses will be used past their 16-year optimum lifespan, according to the budget, and four-car CTrain service will gradually be brought down to three-car, as 46 cars that have moved beyond their lifespan are decommissioned.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nenshi said there isn't any “imminent danger” of seeing CTrain service reduced to three cars. But over what he said would be a long period of time, as the oldest LRT cars can't run any longer, there could be fewer cars in service.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“What this budget actually does is it puts more money into maintenance to keep those trains going longer,” he said. “Ultimately, we have to replace them.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Budget documents say Calgary Transit's reliability could go down, and there will be decreases in maintenance to buildings, such as stations, as well as light rail transit (LRT) systems and customer technologies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Budget documents also detail plans to hire more peace officers, provide better training and support for front-line operators, and improve snow and ice control across the transit system.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">HOUSING</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Affordable housing is looking at a $31-million boost, contingent on $75 million in grants from the province and feds. With these increased funds, the city intends to build or redevelop 487 affordable homes between 2019 and 2022.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Budget documents also say the increased funds could support two city programs — the Housing Incentive Program and the city's land program — that are designed to assist non-profit housing developers. These programs could support them to build 1,900 affordable homes over the course of the four-year budget cycle.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">TAXES</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Property taxes are going up: 3.45 per cent in 2019, and 3 per cent for each of the remaining three years of the budget. For the average household, this will translate to an increase of roughly $60 per year, according to the City of Calgary. The average residential customer could see a slight decrease in their hydro bill, but an increase to waste and recycling costs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Part of the tax increase is owed to the city's approval of 14 new communities[https://www.thestar.com/calgary/2018/08/03/experts-question-calgary-city-council-decision-to-approve-suburban-growth.html] on Calgary's outer edges. That growth requires more funding for services those neighbourhoods will need, and in August, council approved a property tax increase of up to 0.75 per cent to accommodate that.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The ongoing tax shift from downtown office towers to non-residential properties outside the core isn't making its way into the budget. Fielding said city administration will recommend the city once again draw from its reserve funds to cap increases to property owners. It isn't clear exactly how much they'll need, but Fielding said the city likely won't be able to hold increases at 5 per cent, as has been done in the past.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A report is set to come before council in early 2019 about what action could be taken on the tax shift issue.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">ROADS AND SIDEWALKS</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Calgary's operating budget for sidewalks and pathways is climbing 5 per cent in 2019, but will see a major jump — 49 per cent, according to budget documents — in 2020. It'll then drop by 13 per cent, and see a 3 per cent boost in 2022.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Budget documents propose cutting back on life-cycle maintenance of sidewalks, pedestrian bridges and the Plus-15, but expanding snow and ice removal on city sidewalks and pathways, as well as looking into stop-gap measures until the Main Streets initiative is finished.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Improving safety is a big part of the budget's proposals for Calgary's roads. The operating budget proposes modest increases — 1 per cent in 2019, jumping to 8 per cent in 2020, and then dropping to 4 per cent for 2021 and 2022 — but recommends less life-cycle maintenance on streets and bridges in the city.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The budget also calls for less investment in major transportation projects, such as highway interchanges or corridor expansions, and fewer engineering studies to advance current and future projects. This is thanks to constrained capital funding for the 2019-2022 budget cycle. No major projects will be pursued in Calgary's established areas, budget documents say, which will “result in lower service levels as the city grows” and place further burdens on those repairing potholes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">INFRASTRUCTURE AND CAPITAL PROJECTS</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are still numerous infrastructure projects council is considering — such as a new arena and entertainment district, renovations to the BMO Centre and Arts Commons renovations — that aren't included in the budget. Council will discuss whether they want to determine a funding source for that work moving forward.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">POLICE AND EMERGENCY SERVICES</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Calgary's police operating budget isn't seeing any decreases. It'll hold at just over $401 million in 2019, and see a 2 per cent increase in both 2021 and 2022. That translates to 60 new full-time equivalent positions for each of the last two years of the budget cycle, but it's unclear whether that means more front-line officers or other staff.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The budget documents also call for a total of $117 million between 2019 and 2022 to replace equipment and vehicles, including two police helicopters, and to deploy cameras at intersections with high collision rates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">However, Calgary's fire and emergency response service operating budget is getting a 5 per cent cut in 2019, although it'll see a 3 per cent increase in 2020 and a 5 per cent increase in 2021. And between 2020 and 2021, the Calgary Fire Department expects to hire 102 full-time equivalent positions. (Again, it isn't clear whether these are front-line firefighters or other staff.)</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">However, Calgary's fire and emergency response service operating budget is getting a 5 per cent cut in 2019, although it'll see a 3 per cent increase in 2020 and a 5 per cent increase in 2021. And between 2020 and 2021, the Calgary Fire Department expects to hire 102 full-time equivalent positions. (Again, it isn't clear whether these are front-line firefighters or other staff.)</p>

Mark Little, chief operating officer appointed president and will become chief executive officer at Suncor’s 2019 Annual General Meeting</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CALGARY, Alberta, Nov. 14, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Suncor today announced that Steve Williams will retire as chief executive officer at the company's Annual General Meeting on May 2, 2019. Mark Little, chief operating officer is appointed president effective immediately and will assume the role of chief executive officer upon Williams’ retirement next May.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Steve has demonstrated exceptionally strong leadership as president and chief executive officer at Suncor,” said Mike Wilson, chair of Suncor’s Board of Directors. “Steve has been with Suncor for 16 years and has a long list of contributions, including leading the company in achieving greater reliability, profitability and environmental and safety improvement through operational excellence and ensuring the long-term resilience of the company.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Wilson added, “He’s overseen Suncor’s profitable growth both through strategic acquisitions and well-executed projects such as Fort Hills, which has raised the bar for our industry in terms of successful project management and ramp up, technology deployment, and engagement with Aboriginal communities. He’s led the charge as Suncor took a leadership position in sustainability by improving Suncor’s economic, environmental and social performance and influencing the industry through the formation of technology-focused organizations, including Canada’s Oil Sands Innovation Alliance and its predecessor, the Oil Sands Leadership Initiative. He also stands out as an influential business leader in Canadian and international forums, serving as a Board member of the Business Council of Canada, an advisory committee member for Canada’s Ecofiscal Commission and as a member of the official federal delegation at the United Nations Climate Change Conference in Paris.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I consider myself extremely fortunate to have been a part of Suncor, working with a highly effective team as we developed and executed our business strategy. I’m very proud of what we’ve accomplished together – raising the bar on performance, profitably growing the company, and demonstrating leadership in sustainability, while consistently returning value to our shareholders,” said Williams. “I extend my appreciation to Suncor's employees who through the course of their daily work, reflect our dedication and commitment to shareholders and their communities. I also want to thank our executive team for their strategic insights and our Board of Directors for their unwavering support.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“It’s been a privilege to lead Suncor. I’m making this transition now, knowing that it’s a good time to do so,” said Williams. “Thanks to a sound strategy grounded in operational excellence and capital discipline, a healthy balance sheet, and an ongoing focus on sustainability and technology and innovation, I’m optimistic about Suncor’s future under Mark’s leadership.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We are pleased to appoint Mark president of Suncor,” said Mike Wilson. “This is another milestone in a carefully developed and executed CEO succession plan. In his ten years with the company, Mark has worked closely with Steve, demonstrating a deep knowledge of Suncor’s operations and a strong commitment to Suncor’s proven business strategy and integrated model. He also has a keen understanding and appreciation of the issues and opportunities facing our industry which will be crucial for success in his new role.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I’m confident in Mark’s ability to lead the company going forward,” said Williams. “He has significant experience, business acumen, passion and energy which will serve him and Suncor well. In 2017, we appointed Mark as chief operating officer based on his leadership, strategic perspective, knowledge and expertise. He has demonstrated a strong commitment to safety, operational reliability and continuous improvement, as well as a personal commitment to engagement with Aboriginal communities.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Mark Little joined Suncor in 2008 and the following year, played a leadership role in the successful integration of Suncor and Petro-Canada following the merger. He went on to serve in a variety of leadership roles in the company’s oil sands and international and offshore operations. He was appointed chief operating officer in December 2017, becoming responsible for all of Suncor’s operations and many of its corporate services.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Before joining Suncor Mark led the development of oil sands projects for a major international energy company. His past experience also includes leadership roles in oil sands production and refining operations, strategic planning, environment, health and safety, and energy trading.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I'm excited to be moving into this new role,” said Little. “I want to thank Steve for his leadership and vision. The strong foundation that he’s put into place positions Suncor very well. I look forward to guiding Suncor as we continue its success story.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Today's announcement demonstrates Suncor’s strong succession planning and leadership and highlights the discipline and planning that has enabled the company to achieve significant business objectives. This has included reductions in operating costs, consistent cash generation and return of cash to shareholders, as underscored by 16 consecutive years of dividend increases, enabling the company to maintain its compelling investor proposition. Suncor has also achieved further production growth, while demonstrating leadership in sustainability through ongoing environmental and social performance improvements.</p>

</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q3 2018 Highlights</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">* Achieved an average production of 995 boepd for the three months ended September 30, 2018 and 1,187 boepd for the nine months ended September 30, 2018, representing a 118% and 190% increase from the same respective periods in 2017. Production during the fourth quarter of 2018 to date has increased to an average of 1,086 boepd due mainly to the production from the recently drilled Sh-12 well in Kazakhstan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">* Realized crude oil and natural gas sales of $3.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2018 and $13.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2018 represents a 103% and 226% increase from the same respective periods in 2017.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">* Realized a robust operating netback1 of $8.9 million or $27.99 per boe, representing a 296% increase from $2.2 million and a 52% increase from $18.47 per barrel respectively for the nine months ended September 30, 2017.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">* Generated cash from operating activities of $6.1 million or $0.14 per basic share during the nine months ended September 30, 2018 versus cash used in operating activities of $6.2 million or $0.14 per basic share during the same period in 2017.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">* During the second half of 2018 to date, two new horizontal wells were drilled at Shoba and two well workovers performed at Taskuduk.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">* During the second half of 2018 to date, the PW-6 well was completed and two workovers were performed at Poyraz Ridge.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">* The Ministry of Energy of the Government of Kazakhstan (“Ministry”) did not appeal the Kazakhstan court rulings that confirmed a force majeure event had occurred related to the Company’s Zharkamys exploration contract (“Zharkamys Contract”). The Company has submitted an extension application to the Ministry and expects the exploration period to the Zharkamys Contract will be extended by 630 days commencing in 2019.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">* In 2018 the reference natural gas sales price in Turkey set by BOTAS, the state owned pipeline transportation company, has been increased five separate times resulting in an overall increase of 92% in Turkish Lira (“TRL”). Despite the recent TRL devaluation, using prevailing TRL/CAD exchange rates, the natural gas sales price in CAD terms has increased 42% to $9.37 per Mscf as of mid-November 2018 (4.0843 TRL/CAD) from $6.60 per Mscf as of December 31, 2017 (3.0211 TRL/CAD).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">* The Company recorded a net loss of $4.5 million before and after tax for the three months ended September 30, 2018 (2017: net loss before and after tax of $2.5 million) which includes a $3.2 million foreign exchange loss.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">* Certain terms of the Company’s existing secured non-revolving credit facility were amended with the single arm’s length lender, allowing for near term production and cash flow growth by executing the aforementioned drilling and workover programs. Operations</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Company produces crude oil in Kazakhstan and natural gas and associated condensate in Turkey. Overall production for the three months ended September 30, 2018 increased 118% to 91,560 barrels of oil equivalent or an average of 995 boepd from 42,059 barrels of oil or an average of 457 bopd for the same period in 2017 and also increased 190% for the nine months ended September 30, 2018 to 323,885 barrels of oil equivalent or an average of 1,187 boepd from 111,806 barrels of oil or an average of 410 bopd for the same period in 2017. The production increases in 2018 are due mainly to the commencement of natural gas production in Turkey in December of 2017. Further increases are expected due to the infill drilling and workover programs in Kazakhstan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Company produced 31,600 barrels of oil or an average of 343 bopd and realized an operating netback1 of $26.11 per barrel in Kazakhstan for the third quarter of 2018 (third quarter of 2017: produced 42,059 barrels or an average of 457 bopd and an operating netback1 of $19.79 per barrel). For the nine months ended September 30, 2018 the Company produced 104,778 barrels of oil or an average of 384 bopd with an operating netback1 of $24.24 per barrel in Kazakhstan (nine months ended September 30, 2017: produced 111,806 barrels or an average of 410 bopd and an operating netback1 of $18.47 per barrel).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Two horizontal wells were drilled and completed in Kazakhstan during the second half of 2018. A 493 meter lateral section was drilled on Sh-12 which has produced an average of 150 bopd to date. A 502 meter lateral section was drilled on Sh-15. It is believed Sh-15 intersected a fault that is in communication with the field’s oil-water contact thereby producing mostly water. A Sh-15 recompletion is planned for the fourth quarter of 2018 to isolate the fracture interval and increase production rates. A two well workover program has recently been completed to replace downhole pumps on TasW-3 and TasW-4 and production is expected to resume shortly. The Company’s capital program for 2019 includes drilling up to three additional horizontal wells at Shoba.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Company produced 59,960 boe in Turkey or an average of 652 boepd and received an operating netback1 of $25.22 per boe for the three months ended September 30, 2018 (three months ended September 30, 2017: no gas production or sales) and 219,107 boe in Turkey or an average of 803 boepd and received an operating netback1 of $29.87 per boe for the nine months ended September 30, 2018 (nine months ended September 30, 2017: no gas production or sales).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A workover program is being developed and executed which focuses on completing additional pay sections and stimulation options to realize commercial gas flow rates for the lower permeability reservoirs. The PW-6 infill well was completed in the third quarter of 2018 and initially had negligible pressure and flow response. However, the well has started flowing intermittently after adding perforations and performing a fluid treatment. Data is being gathered that should provide further diagnosis and remediation options. An additional zone was also perforated on PW-5, a 2017 exploration well that targeted the footwall compartment lying to the north of the Poyraz Ridge field. Although PW-5 did not flow when tested in 2017, the newly perforated interval has started flowing intermittently. Data is being gathered at PW-5 which may identify further remediation options for this well and field development opportunities for this region. The Company’s capital program for 2019 includes drilling one development well at Poyraz Ridge.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Cash from operating activities increased to $6.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2018 versus cash used in operating activities of $6.2 million for the same period in 2017. Cash from operating activities before changes in non-cash working capital increased to $4.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2018 versus cash used in operating activities before changes in non-cash working capital of $4.9 million for the same period in 2017.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Zharkamys Contract</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Company’s Zharkamys Contract was due to expire on December 14, 2016. Prior to this date, the Kazakhstan Chamber of International Commerce and subsequently the Kazakhstan Civil Court (“Civil Court”) confirmed that a force majeure event had occurred which, under Kazakhstan subsurface use law, can be the basis for the Zharkamys Contract validity period to be extended for a period of 630 days. In May 2017, the Kazakhstan Court of Appeal (“Court of Appeal”), pursuant to an appeal filed by the Ministry, ruled that the force majeure event was not recognized and reversed the decision of the Civil Court. The Company referred the case to the Kazakhstan Supreme Court (“Supreme Court”) and in November 2017 the Supreme Court ruling overturned both the Civil Court and the Court of Appeal rulings and referred the case back to the Civil Court for further review by a new panel of judges. In March 2018 the Civil Court ruling confirmed that the force majeure event had occurred. In April 2018 the Ministry appealed the Civil Court ruling and in May 2018 the Court of Appeal upheld the Civil Court ruling that the force majeure event had occurred. Since the May 2018 ruling, the Ministry has not filed an appeal to the Supreme Court within the six month timeframe allotted by Kazakhstan law. The Company has submitted an extension application to the Ministry and expects the exploration period to the Zharkamys Contract will be extended by 630 days commencing in 2019.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">* Barrels of oil equivalent (“boe”) are derived by converting gas to oil in the ratio of six thousand standard cubic feet (“Mscf”) of gas to one barrel of oil based on an energy conversion method primarily applicable at the burner tip and does not represent a value equivalency at the wellhead. Given the value ratio based on the current price of crude oil as compared to natural gas is significantly different from the energy equivalency of 6 Mscf to 1 barrel, utilizing a conversion ratio at 6 Mscf to 1 barrel may be misleading as an indication of value, particularly if used in isolation.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">President's Message</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Stronger crude prices and lower cash costs drove third quarter growth in Freehold’s funds from operations. Reflecting lower volumes year to date, we are revising our 2018 production guidance by 4% to a range of 11,250-11,500 boe/d. Reduced volumes are associated with lower third-party production additions, natural gas and heavy oil curtailments and fewer audit recoveries. We will continue to monitor industry activity and will provide 2019 guidance as part of our fourth quarter results.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Looking forward, we anticipate some near-term headwinds associated with Canadian energy, however, many of our prospects are light oil opportunities in Saskatchewan where pricing is better. As we saw in Q3-2018, we see more industry drilling occurring where there are lighter oil opportunities and the economics are superior.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As we have for the past 22 years, we will continue to strive to preserve our balance sheet and maintain an attractive dividend, thus providing investors with a lower risk oil and gas investment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Tom Mullane President and CEO</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dividend Announcement</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Board has declared a dividend of $0.0525 per common share to be paid on December 17, 2018 to shareholders of record on November 30, 2018. The dividend is designated as an eligible dividend for Canadian income tax purposes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">2018 Third Quarter Highlights</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Freehold delivered strong financial results in the third quarter of 2018. Highlights included:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">* Funds from operations totaled $35.9 million, an increase of 29% compared to Q3-2017 and 4% versus the previous quarter. Higher funds from operations was largely driven by better oil and natural gas liquids (NGL) prices. On a per share basis, funds from operations was $0.30/share in Q3-2018 up from $0.24/share in Q3-2017 and $0.29/share in Q2-2018.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">* Freehold's royalty production averaged 10,322 boe/d, down 5% versus Q3-2017 and 7% when compared to Q2-2018. Reduced volumes are associated with lower third-party production additions, natural gas and heavy oil curtailments and fewer audit recoveries (75 boe/d in Q3-2018 versus 700 boe/d in Q3-2017). Historically, we have seen a slight drop in royalty production from Q2 to Q3 with a rebound in Q4.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">* Royalty interests accounted for 94% of total production and contributed 99% of operating income in Q3-2018.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">* Working interest production declined 39% to 680 boe/d in Q3-2018 relative to Q3-2017 largely due to dispositions, in-line with our strategy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">* Wells drilled on our royalty lands totaled 175 (6.3 net) in the quarter compared to 144 (6.4 net) in Q3-2017. Approximately 80% of non-unit activity was focused on our gross overriding royalty lands (GORR) lands while approximately 20% targeted prospects on our mineral title land. For the first nine months of 2018, 499 gross (13.9 net) wells have been drilled, compared to 352 gross (16.6 net) during the same period last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">* Freehold generated $16.4 million in free cash flow (1), over and above our dividend, which we applied to acquisitions completed during the quarter. At September 30, 2018, net debt totaled $78.7 million resulting in a net debt to funds from operations ratio of 0.6 times.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">* Freehold allocated $17.9 million towards acquisition activities in Q3-2018. In August, Freehold closed the purchase of 64,000 acres of royalty lands with approximately 90 boe/d of production (one-third oil and NGL) across central Alberta and the Deep Basin for $5.9 million and the assignment of certain minor working interest assets. In September, Freehold closed the purchase of a GORR across 109,000 acres of land with prospectivity for the Clearwater formation in the Jarvie and Nipisi areas of Alberta for $12 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">* In Q3-2018, Freehold issued 19 new lease agreements with 13 companies, compared to 18 issued in Q2-2018 and 30 leases in Q3-2017, highlighting the success of our leasing team. To September 30th in 2018 (YTD) we have completed 95 new lease agreements on our royalty lands. Since the inception of our leasing team in January 2017 we have completed 195 new lease agreements.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">* Cash costs (1) for the quarter totaled $4.46/boe, down from $4.80/boe in Q3-2017. For 2018, we are forecasting cash costs of approximately $5.00/boe.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">* Dividends declared for Q3-2018 totaled $0.1575 per share, up 5% versus the previous year. In March 2018, Freehold announced an increase to its monthly dividend from $0.05 to $0.0525 per share commencing in April 2018.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">* Basic payout ratio (1) (dividends declared/funds from operations) for Q3-2018 totaled 52% while the adjusted payout ratio (1) ((cash dividends plus capital expenditures)/funds from operations) for the same period was 54%. (1) See Non-GAAP Financial Measures</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Royalty Drilling</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Including drilling associated with acquisitions and unit wells, 499 (13.9 net) wells were drilled on our royalty lands during the first nine months of 2018. This represents an increase of 42% on a gross basis and a 16% decline on a net measure versus the same period in 2017. As typical in the third quarter, we saw a rebound in activity on our royalty lands relative to Q2-2018.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Activity through the first nine months of 2018 was primarily focused on Saskatchewan oil projects. Drilling in the Viking at Dodsland and Mississippian carbonates in southeast Saskatchewan continue to lead activity in Saskatchewan. In Alberta, Cardium oil drilling continues to drive activity, with a recent uptick in Viking Oil development. In Q3-2018 19 gross Alberta Viking oil wells were drilled on our lands compared with six in the entire first half of 2018. Industry drilled 131 gross wells on our non-unit lands in Q3-2018 (299 YTD) and 44 wells on our unit lands (200 YTD). 27 of those non-unit drills were on title land and 104 were on GORR lands. Our top payors continue to represent some of the most well capitalized E&P companies in Canada.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Guidance Update</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Below are details of some of the changes made to our key operating assumptions for 2018 based on results for the first nine months of the year and expectations for the remainder of the year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">* We are revising our 2018 average production range downwards by 4% to 11,250-11,500 boe/d (previously 11,750-12,250 boe/d). There has been lower than expected production from royalty drilling, lower than typical additions from our audit function and production curtailments associated with weakness in natural gas and heavy oil pricing. Volumes are expected to be weighted approximately 54% oil and NGL and 46% natural gas. We continue to maintain our royalty focus with royalty production accounting for 94% of forecasted 2018 production and 99% of operating income.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">* We are maintaining our 2018 drilling forecast of 20 net wells.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">* We are maintaining our WTI oil price assumption of US$65.00/bbl. However, we have reduced our WCS price assumption to $50.00/bbl (previously $55.00/bbl) and our Edmonton Light Sweet price assumption to $70.00/bbl (previously $76.00/bbl), reflecting higher differentials caused by increasing Canadian production levels and limited takeaway capacity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">* We have reduced our AECO natural gas price assumption to $1.55/mcf (previously $1.75/mcf) reflecting lower than expected prices to date.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">* Based on our current $0.0525/share monthly dividend level, we expect our 2018 adjusted payout ratio ((cash dividends plus capital expenditures)/funds from operations) to be approximately 64% (previously 55%).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">* General and administrative costs remain at $2.50/boe.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">* We have increased our forecast year-end net debt to funds from operations to approximately 0.8 times due to acquisitions completed and revisions to our production and pricing guidance. Key Operating Assumptions</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Recognizing the cyclical nature of the oil and gas industry, we continue to closely monitor commodity prices and industry trends for signs of changing market conditions. We caution that it is inherently difficult to predict activity levels on our royalty lands since we have no operational control. As well, significant changes (positive or negative) in commodity prices (including Canadian oil price differentials), foreign exchange rates, or production rates may result in adjustments to the dividend rate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Based on our current guidance and commodity price assumptions, and assuming no significant changes in the current business environment, we expect to maintain the current monthly dividend rate through the next quarter. We will continue to evaluate the commodity price environment and adjust the dividend levels as necessary (subject to the quarterly review and approval of our Board of Directors).</p>

By their nature, forward-looking statements are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, some of which are beyond our control, including the impact of general economic conditions, industry conditions, volatility of commodity prices, currency fluctuations, imprecision of reserve estimates, royalties, environmental risks, taxation, regulation, changes in tax or other legislation, competition from other industry participants, the lack of availability of qualified personnel or management, stock market volatility, and our ability to access sufficient capital from internal and external sources. Risks are described in more detail in our Annual Information Form available at .</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With respect to forward-looking statements contained in this news release, we have made assumptions regarding, among other things, future commodity prices, future capital expenditure levels, future production levels, future exchange rates, future tax rates, future legislation, the cost of developing and producing our assets, our ability and the ability of our lessees to obtain equipment in a timely manner to carry out development activities, our ability to market our oil and gas successfully to current and new customers, our expectation for the consumption of crude oil and natural gas, our expectation for industry drilling levels, our ability to obtain financing on acceptable terms, shut-in production, production additions from our audit function and our ability to add production and reserves through development and acquisition activities. The key operating assumptions with respect to the forward-looking statements referred to above are detailed in the body of this news release.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">You are cautioned that the assumptions used in the preparation of such information, although considered reasonable at the time of preparation, may prove to be imprecise and, as such, undue reliance should not be placed on forward-looking statements. Our actual results, performance, or achievement could differ materially from those expressed in, or implied by, these forward-looking statements. We can give no assurance that any of the events anticipated will transpire or occur, or if any of them do, what benefits we will derive from them. The forward-looking information contained in this document is expressly qualified by this cautionary statement. To the extent any guidance or forward looking statements herein constitute a financial outlook, they are included herein to provide readers with an understanding of management's plans and assumptions for budgeting purposes and readers are cautioned that the information may not be appropriate for other purposes. Our policy for updating forward-looking statements is to update our key operating assumptions quarterly and, except as required by law, we do not undertake to update any other forward-looking statements.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">You are further cautioned that the preparation of financial statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), which are the Canadian generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) for publicly accountable enterprises, requires management to make certain judgments and estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses. These estimates may change, having either a positive or negative effect on net income, as further information becomes available and as the economic environment changes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Conversion of Natural Gas to Barrels of Oil Equivalent (BOE)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To provide a single unit of production for analytical purposes, natural gas production and reserves volumes are converted mathematically to equivalent barrels of oil (boe). We use the industry-accepted standard conversion of six thousand cubic feet of natural gas to one barrel of oil (6 Mcf = 1 bbl). The 6:1 boe ratio is based on an energy equivalency conversion method primarily applicable at the burner tip. It does not represent a value equivalency at the wellhead and is not based on either energy content or current prices. While the boe ratio is useful for comparative measures and observing trends, it does not accurately reflect individual product values and might be misleading, particularly if used in isolation. As well, given that the value ratio, based on the current price of crude oil to natural gas, is significantly different from the 6:1 energy equivalency ratio, using a 6:1 conversion ratio may be misleading as an indication of value.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Non-GAAP Financial Measures</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Within this news release, references are made to terms commonly used as key performance indicators in the oil and natural gas industry. We believe that, operating income, operating netback, basic payout ratio, adjusted payout ratio, free cash flow and cash costs are useful supplemental measures for management and investors to analyze operating performance, financial leverage, and liquidity, and we use these terms to facilitate the understanding and comparability of our results of operations and financial position. However, these terms do not have any standardized meanings prescribed by GAAP and therefore may not be comparable with the calculations of similar measures for other entities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Operating income, which is calculated as royalty and other revenue less royalties and operating expenses, represents the cash margin for product sold. Operating netback, which is calculated as average unit sales price less royalties and operating expenses, represents the cash margin for product sold, calculated on a per boe basis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Payout ratios are often used for dividend paying companies in the oil and gas industry to identify its dividend levels in relation to the funds it receives and uses in its capital and operational activities. Basic payout ratio is calculated as dividends declared as a percentage of funds from operations. Adjusted payout ratio is calculated as dividends paid in cash plus capital expenditures as a percentage of funds from operations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Free cash flow is calculated by subtracting capital expenditures from funds from operations. Free cash flow is a measure often used by dividend paying companies to determine cash available for payment of dividends, paying down debt or investment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Cash costs is a total of certain cash expenses in the statement of income deducted in determining funds from operations. For Freehold cash costs are identified as royalty expense, operating expense, general and administrative expense, interest expense and share based compensation payments. It is key to funds from operations, representing the ability to, sustain dividends, repay debt and fund capital expenditures.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We refer to various per boe figures which provide meaningful information on our operational performance. We derive per boe figures by dividing the relevant revenue or cost figure by the total volume of oil, NGL and natural gas production during the period, with natural gas converted to equivalent barrels of oil as described above.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The judge that overturned that project's <span class="companylink">NEB</span> approval cited a lack of meaningful consultations with Indigenous people and failure to consider marine environmental impacts.</p>

In addition to consolidating our land position in the area, we believe that these lands are located on a significant liquids-rich trend in Pouce Coupe. During 2019, we anticipate that we will generate significant free funds flow which may be used to reduce debt, pursue additional growth, increase our common share dividend and/or to fund share buybacks.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q3 2018 Highlights</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">STRATEGIC MONTNEY LAND ACQUISITION IN POUCE COUPE</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Birchcliff recently entered into a definitive purchase and sale agreement to acquire 18 gross (15.1 net) contiguous sections of Montney land located between the Corporation’s existing Pouce Coupe and Gordondale properties, as well as various other non-Montney lands and other assets, for total cash consideration of $39 million (before customary closing adjustments) (the “Acquisition”). Closing of the Acquisition is expected to occur on or about January 3, 2019 and will further consolidate Birchcliff’s land position in the area. After giving effect to the Acquisition, Birchcliff will have approximately 217.2 gross (206.6 net) sections of mostly contiguous Montney lands in the Pouce Coupe and Gordondale areas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A map accompanying this announcement is available athttp://www.globenewswire.com/NewsRoom/AttachmentNg/d2a64459-67b3-4218-9034-576fadb3fac1[http://www.globenewswire.com/NewsRoom/AttachmentNg/d2a64459-67b3-4218-9034-576fadb3fac1]
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Birchcliff believes that the lands are located on a significant liquids-rich trend in Pouce Coupe and are highly prospective for natural gas, oil, condensate and other liquids in the Montney D1, D2, C and Basal Doig/Upper Montney intervals. The lands are located near Birchcliff’s science and technology pad in Pouce Coupe where Birchcliff drilled four successful wells in 2018 (two in the Montney D1, one in the Montney D2 and one in the Montney C intervals).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Current production from the lands is approximately 700 boe/d (approximately 14% oil and NGLs) and is predominantly from 9 Montney horizontal wells (8 Montney D1 and 1 Upper Montney D5) which were drilled and completed using older technology. The most recent wells were drilled in 2014. The existing production is currently processed at third party facilities; however, such production is expected to be redirected to Birchcliff’s Pouce Coupe Gas Plant or AltaGas’ deep-cut sour gas processing facility in Gordondale (the “Gordondale Gas Plant”) in the future.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Birchcliff currently plans to drill 5 wells from one pad on the lands in Q1 2019. The production from new wells drilled by Birchcliff on the lands is expected to be processed at the Pouce Coupe Gas Plant.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Acquisition will be funded through the Corporation’s existing credit facilities. Closing of the Acquisition is subject to the satisfaction or waiver of customary closing conditions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">PRELIMINARY 2019 PLANS</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Preliminary 2019 Capital Spending Plans</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Birchcliff is currently in the process of finalizing its strategy and capital spending plans for 2019, with a focus on generating free funds flow. Depending on market sentiment, economic conditions, commodity prices and other factors, preliminary F&D capital spending is currently expected to be approximately $210 million, which is anticipated to generate annual average production of approximately 76,000 to 78,000 boe/d during 2019. F&D capital spending, plus the Acquisition, is currently expected to be approximately $249 million. The following table sets forth Birchcliff’s preliminary guidance for 2019, as well as its commodity price assumptions:</p>

 (1)  The Corporation intends to finalize its 2019 capital spending plans and guidance after the completion of its 2018 capital program. Birchcliff’s 2019 capital expenditure budget will be subject to approval by its board of directors. The preliminary guidance set forth herein is subject to change and, except for the Acquisition, does not take into account any potential future acquisition and disposition activity during 2019 which could have an impact on such guidance. Certain numbers presented in the table above are approximate. See “Advisories – Forward-Looking Statements”.
 
 (2)  Based on 77,000 boe/d, which is the mid-point of Birchcliff’s preliminary annual average production guidance for 2019.
 
 (3)  See “Advisories – Capital Expenditures”.
 
 (4)  Includes the capital required to bring on production 26 horizontal wells, which is approximately the number of wells required by Birchcliff to achieve an annual average production rate of 77,000 boe/d in 2019. These 26 horizontal wells include 9 wells that the Corporation plans to drill in Q4 2018. None of these 9 wells will be completed in 2018. See “Operational Update – Acceleration of 2019 Capital”.
 
 (5)  Free funds flow is calculated as adjusted funds flow less F&D capital expenditures and is prior to administrative assets, acquisitions, dispositions, dividend payments and abandonment and reclamation obligations. See “Non-GAAP Measures”. Free funds flow may be used by Birchcliff to reduce debt, pursue additional growth, pay dividends, increase its common share dividend and/or to fund share buybacks under its normal course issuer bid. Any prolonged or significant decrease in commodity prices may not leave sufficient free funds flow for debt reduction or the other foregoing purposes.
 
 (6)  Represents the purchase price for the Acquisition of $39 million (before adjustments).
 
 (7)  Approximately 1% of total natural gas production is expected to be sold via the Alliance pipeline system in 2019. See “2019 Risk Management Contracts and Market Diversification”.
 
 (8)  $1.00 per MMBtu equals $1.00 per Mcf based on a standard heat value of 37.4 MJ/m3 or a heat uplift of 1.055 when converting from $/GJ.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Based on the assumptions set forth in the table above, Birchcliff currently expects that it will be in a position to generate significant free funds flow during 2019. Given this anticipated free funds flow and Birchcliff’s strong balance sheet, the Corporation will be well positioned to reduce debt, pursue additional growth, increase its common share dividend and/or consider share buybacks under its normal course issuer bid. The 2019 capital program will be designed with flexibility to accelerate expansion capital should economic conditions improve and defer capital should conditions deteriorate. If economic conditions and commodity prices improve, Birchcliff has the ability to increase its natural gas production as a result of available capacity at its Phase VI Pouce Coupe Gas Plant. If economic conditions and commodity prices remain the same or deteriorate, Birchcliff expects that it will choose to focus on debt reduction.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">2019 Risk Management Contracts and Market Diversification</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Birchcliff actively looks for profitable opportunities to diversify its natural gas markets and reduce its exposure to prices at AECO. In addition, Birchcliff maintains an ongoing hedging program and engages in various risk management activities to reduce its exposure to volatility in commodity prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Birchcliff has agreements for the firm service transportation of an aggregate of 175,000 GJ/d of natural gas on TCPL’s Canadian Mainline for a 10-year term, whereby natural gas is transported to the Dawn trading hub located in Southern Ontario. The first tranche of this service (120,000 GJ/d) became available to Birchcliff on November 1, 2017 and the second tranche became available on November 1, 2018 (30,000 GJ/d), with the final additional tranche becoming available on November 1, 2019 (25,000 GJ/d). Birchcliff also has a sales agreement with a third party marketer to sell and deliver approximately 5 MMcf/d of natural gas from April 1, 2017 to October 31, 2020, which is sold at Alliance’s Trading Pool daily index price. In addition, Birchcliff has entered into various risk management contracts with respect to 2019 and beyond, including <span class="companylink">NYMEX</span> basis swaps which fix the basis differential between the AECO price and the <span class="companylink">NYMEX</span> Henry Hub price.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">THIRD QUARTER 2018 FINANCIAL AND OPERATIONAL RESULTS</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Production</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Birchcliff achieved strong average production of 79,331 boe/d during the quarter, a 22% increase from 65,276 boe/d in Q3 2017. The increase was primarily attributable to the success of Birchcliff’s capital programs which resulted in incremental production from new horizontal wells brought on production in Pouce Coupe and Gordondale, partially offset by the sale of the Corporation’s oil-weighted assets in the Worsley area in Q3 2017, temporary restrictions in pipeline and compressor station capacity on the Alberta NGTL system during Q3 2018 and natural production declines.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Production consisted of approximately 81% natural gas, 6% light oil and 13% NGLs, as compared to 79% natural gas, 10% light oil and 11% NGLs in Q3 2017. Of the NGLs produced in Q3 2018, approximately 56% were high-value C4+ liquids. The change in commodity mix from Q3 2017 was primarily due to the disposition of Birchcliff’s oil-weighted Worsley assets and the start-up of Phase V of the Pouce Coupe Gas Plant, both of which occurred in Q3 2017, as well as the start-up of Phase VI of the Pouce Coupe Gas Plant which occurred in Q3 2018.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Adjusted Funds Flow and Net Income to Common Shareholders</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Birchcliff had adjusted funds flow of $75.4 million, or $0.28 per basic common share, a 17% increase from $64.4 million and $0.24 per basic common share in Q3 2017. The increase was primarily due to higher corporate production, higher average realized oil and NGLs sales prices and lower operating expense, partially offset by a lower average realized natural gas sales price, higher aggregate royalty and transportation and other expenses and a realized loss on financial instruments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Birchcliff recorded net income to common shareholders of $6.7 million, or $0.03 per basic common share, as compared to the net loss to common shareholders of $121.7 million and $0.46 per basic common share in Q3 2017. The change from a net loss to a net income position was primarily due to a $132.3 million after-tax loss from the sale of the Worsley assets which was recorded in Q3 2017 and higher adjusted funds flow, partially offset by an increase in depletion and income tax expenses and an unrealized mark-to-market loss on financial instruments in Q3 2018.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Operating Expense</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Birchcliff’s operating expense was $3.45/boe, a 19% decrease from $4.27/boe in Q3 2017. The decrease was primarily due to an incremental increase in natural gas production processed at the Pouce Coupe Gas Plant, reduced processing fees at the Gordondale Gas Plant and the sale of the higher-cost Worsley assets in Q3 2017.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Transportation and Other Expense</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Birchcliff’s transportation and other expense was $3.46/boe, a 31% increase from $2.65/boe in Q3 2017. The increase was primarily due to firm service transportation tolls for natural gas transported to Dawn during Q3 2018, which service commenced on November 1, 2017. The natural gas price at Dawn was significantly higher than at AECO during Q3 2018 (see “Third Quarter 2018 Financial and Operational Results – Commodity Prices”).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">G&A Expense</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Birchcliff’s G&A expense was $0.67/boe, an 18% decrease from $0.82/boe in Q3 2017. The decrease was primarily due to higher production without a corresponding increase in aggregate G&A expense as compared to Q3 2017.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Interest Expense</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Birchcliff’s interest expense was $0.99/boe, a 14% decrease from $1.15/boe in Q3 2017. The decrease was primarily due to higher corporate production, partially offset by a higher average effective interest rate and a higher average outstanding credit facilities balance in Q3 2018.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Adjusted Funds Flow Netback and Total Cash Costs</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Birchcliff’s adjusted funds flow netback was $10.33/boe, a 4% decrease from $10.73 in Q3 2017. The decrease was primarily due to higher total cash costs and a realized loss on financial instruments, partially offset by an increase in Birchcliff’s total corporate average realized sales price.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Birchcliff’s total cash costs were $10.09/boe, a 6% increase from $9.52/boe in Q3 2017. The increase was primarily due to higher royalty and transportation and other expenses on a per boe basis, partially offset by lower operating, G&A and interest expenses on a per boe basis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pouce Coupe Gas Plant Netbacks</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">During the first nine months of 2018, Birchcliff processed approximately 68% of its total corporate natural gas production and 58% of its total corporate production through the Pouce Coupe Gas Plant as compared to 58% and 47%, respectively, during the first nine months of 2017. These increases were primarily due to the incremental production from horizontal natural gas wells brought on production in Pouce Coupe. The average plant and field operating expense for production processed through the Pouce Coupe Gas Plant in the first nine months of 2018 was $0.35/Mcfe ($2.08/boe) and the operating netback at the Pouce Coupe Gas Plant was $1.91/Mcfe ($11.46/boe), resulting in an operating margin of 67% in the first nine months of 2018.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">OPERATIONAL UPDATE</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Update on the 2018 Capital Program</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Year-to-date, Birchcliff has been very active with the execution of its 2018 capital program which is focused on the drilling of crude oil wells in Gordondale and a combination of liquids-rich and low-cost natural gas wells in Pouce Coupe. The 2018 capital program was strategically front-end loaded and highly focused on the first half of the year, allowing Birchcliff to bring new wells on production relatively early in the year in order to optimize producing days for the capital spent in 2018. As discussed in further detail below under “Acceleration of 2019 Capital”, Birchcliff is drilling an additional 9 (9.0 net) horizontal wells in Gordondale and Pouce Coupe in Q4 2018 in order to help ensure the efficient execution of its 2019 capital program. None of these additional wells will be completed or brought on production in 2018.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">During the first nine months of 2018, Birchcliff drilled, completed and brought on production all 27 (27.0 net) wells that were originally planned under the 2018 capital program as detailed in the table set forth below:</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><pre class="articlePre" > 
 (1)  The 2018 capital program also included the capital associated with 1 Montney/Doig well in Pouce Coupe that was drilled in December 2017 and subsequently completed and brought on production in 2018. Accordingly, a total of 28 (28.0 net) wells have been brought on production in 2018.
 
 (2)  Does not include the additional 9 wells to be drilled under the expanded 2018 capital program.
 
       
</pre>
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">All of the wells drilled in 2018 were drilled on multi-well pads, which allows Birchcliff to reduce its per well costs and its environmental footprint. In addition, Birchcliff actively employs the evolving technology utilized by the industry regarding horizontal well drilling and the related multi-stage fracture stimulation technology. Birchcliff continues to spend significant time evolving its best practices for drilling and refining its engineered completions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Gordondale</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">During 2018, the Corporation has been focused on the drilling of crude oil wells and the delineation of the Montney D1 and D2 intervals in Gordondale. Since Birchcliff acquired its assets in Gordondale in 2016, it has drilled a total of 36 (36.0 net) wells in Gordondale, consisting of 20 (20.0 net) Montney D2 horizontal oil wells, 11 (11.0 net) Montney D1 horizontal oil wells, 4 (4.0 net) Montney D1 liquids-rich horizontal natural gas wells and 1 (1.0 net) water disposal well. When Birchcliff first acquired its assets in Gordondale, the average production for such assets was approximately 22,000 boe/d at the date of the acquisition. The horizontal wells that Birchcliff has subsequently drilled and brought on production have replaced the natural production declines and significantly increased the production on its Gordondale assets (currently approximately 30,000 boe/d). The Montney D2 horizontal wells that Birchcliff has drilled, completed and brought on production to-date have significantly delineated, de-risked and proven the commerciality of the Montney D2 play.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pouce Coupe</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">During 2018, Birchcliff has been focused on the drilling of liquids-rich natural gas wells and the pursuit of condensate and other NGLs in several different Montney/Doig intervals, including the Montney D1, D2 and C, as well as the completion of infrastructure to allow for future growth. The 80 MMcf/d Phase VI expansion of the Pouce Coupe Gas Plant was brought on-stream during Q3 2018, bringing the total processing capacity of the plant to 340 MMcf/d from 260 MMcf/d. In addition, Birchcliff completed the re-configuration of Phases V and VI in Q4 2018 to provide for shallow-cut capability, allowing Birchcliff to remove propane plus (C3+) from the natural gas stream.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As part of Birchcliff’s commitment to continuous performance improvement, it designed and executed on its science and technology pad in 2018, which involved the drilling of one vertical well and four horizontal wells in three different intervals (one Montney C, one Montney D2 and two Montney D1 wells). Using the pad, Birchcliff was able to acquire high-quality subsurface and operational data. The data for the vertical well included 313 metres of core, high-resolution vertical logs, tilt meters and micro seismic. The data for the four horizontal wells included horizontal high-resolution well logs, permanent fibre optics, tracers, geochemical fluid and rock sampling and significant production flow, build up and interference testing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Using the data, Birchcliff has been able to gain important insights into reservoir behaviour, including fracture initiation and propagation, inter-well fracture communication, well productivity by cluster, the role of natural fractures on production and optimal well spacing by and between zones. In addition, Birchcliff was also able to increase its knowledge regarding field development, including well landing depths, well spacing both laterally and vertically and completion, cluster and stage spacing. In addition, a permanent fibre optic cable installed in one of the horizontal wells allows Birchcliff to observe how wells interact in the subsurface over time. Ultimately, the knowledge gained from the science and technology pad has helped Birchcliff to improve and refine its best practices at the well, pad and field levels in order to optimize field development.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Acceleration of 2019 Capital</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Given the success of its 2018 capital program and the efficiencies associated with commencing field activities outside of the most active season, Birchcliff is proceeding with the drilling of an additional 9 (9.0 net) horizontal wells in Q4 2018 that were originally targeted for 2019. As a result, Birchcliff has increased its 2018 capital expenditure budget by $33 million from $255 million to $288 million. Birchcliff expects that this additional capital investment in 2018 will positively impact 2019 by allowing for a more efficient capital spending profile and reduced capital spending in 2019, as well as providing for a more consistent production profile in 2019. This acceleration will also allow the Corporation to lock-in current service costs and avoid pre-breakup service constraints that Birchcliff experienced in Q1 2018.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of the nine additional wells, five will be drilled in Pouce Coupe and four will be drilled in Gordondale. Birchcliff currently has two rigs at work drilling on two pads, one 4-well pad in Gordondale (two Montney D2 and two Montney D1 wells) and one 3-well pad in Pouce Coupe (all of which are Montney D1 wells).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">None of these wells will be completed this year and no new production or reserves will be added in 2018. It is expected that these wells will be completed and brought on production in Q1 2019. Accordingly, as no new production will be added in 2018, the Corporation’s 2018 annual average production guidance remains unchanged at 76,000 to 78,000 boe/d.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">2018 GUIDANCE</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Birchcliff is focused on protecting its balance sheet and expects that its 2018 adjusted funds flow will exceed its 2018 capital expenditures, based on the assumptions set forth herein. Birchcliff is maintaining its 2018 average production guidance of 76,000 to 78,000 boe/d (80% natural gas and 20% oil and NGLs) and has updated its capital expenditure guidance to reflect the acceleration of 2019 capital into 2018.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NON-GAAP MEASURES</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This press release uses “adjusted funds flow”, “adjusted funds flow per common share”, “free funds flow”, “operating netback”, “adjusted funds flow netback”, “operating margin”, “total cash costs”, “adjusted working capital deficit” and “total debt”. These measures do not have standardized meanings prescribed by GAAP and therefore may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other companies where similar terminology is used. Management believes that these non-GAAP measures assist management and investors in assessing Birchcliff’s profitability, efficiency, liquidity and overall performance. Each of these measures is discussed in further detail below.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Adjusted funds flow” denotes cash flow from operating activities before the effects of decommissioning expenditures and changes in non-cash working capital and “adjusted funds flow per common share” denotes adjusted funds flow divided by the basic or diluted weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period. Birchcliff eliminates changes in non-cash working capital and settlements of decommissioning expenditures from cash flow from operating activities as the amounts can be discretionary and may vary from period-to-period depending on its capital programs and the maturity of its operating areas. The settlement of decommissioning expenditures are managed with Birchcliff’s capital budgeting process which considers available adjusted funds flow. Management believes that adjusted funds flow and adjusted funds flow per common share assist management and investors in assessing Birchcliff’s profitability, as well as its ability to generate the cash necessary to fund future growth through capital investments, decommission its assets, pay dividends and repay debt. Investors are cautioned that adjusted funds flow should not be construed as an alternative to or more meaningful than cash flow from operating activities or net income or loss as determined in accordance with GAAP as an indicator of Birchcliff’s performance. Birchcliff previously referred to adjusted funds flow as “funds flow from operations”. The following table provides a reconciliation of cash flow from operating activities, as determined in accordance with GAAP, to adjusted funds flow for the periods indicated:</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Free funds flow” denotes adjusted funds flow less F&D capital expenditures. Management believes that free funds flow assists management and investors in assessing Birchcliff’s ability to generate the cash necessary to repay debt, pay dividends, fund a portion of its future growth investments and/or fund share buybacks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Operating netback” denotes petroleum and natural gas revenue less royalties, less operating expense and less transportation and other expense. “Adjusted funds flow netback” denotes petroleum and natural gas revenue less royalties, less operating expense, less transportation and other expense, less net G&A expense, less interest expense and less any realized losses (plus realized gains) on financial instruments and plus any other cash income sources. Birchcliff previously referred to adjusted funds flow netback as “funds flow netback”. All netbacks are calculated on a per unit basis, unless otherwise indicated. Management believes that operating netback and adjusted funds flow netback assist management and investors in assessing Birchcliff’s profitability and its operating results on a per unit basis to better analyze its performance against prior periods on a comparable basis. The following table provides a breakdown of Birchcliff’s operating netback and adjusted funds flow netback for the periods indicated:</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Boe and Mcfe Conversions Boe amounts have been calculated by using the conversion ratio of 6 Mcf of natural gas to 1 bbl of oil and Mcfe amounts have been calculated by using the conversion ratio of 1 bbl of oil to 6 Mcf of natural gas. Boe and Mcfe amounts may be misleading, particularly if used in isolation. A boe conversion ratio of 6 Mcf: 1 bbl and an Mcfe conversion ratio of 1 bbl: 6 Mcf is based on an energy equivalency conversion method primarily applicable at the burner tip and does not represent a value equivalency at the wellhead. Given that the value ratio based on the current price of crude oil as compared to natural gas is significantly different from the energy equivalency of 6:1, utilizing a conversion on a 6:1 basis may be misleading as an indication of value.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This press release contains metrics commonly used in the oil and natural gas industry, including netbacks. These oil and gas metrics do not have any standardized meanings or standard methods of calculation and therefore may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other companies where similar terminology is used. As such, they should not be used to make comparisons. Management uses these oil and gas metrics for its own performance measurements and to provide shareholders with measures to compare Birchcliff’s performance over time; however, such measures are not reliable indicators of Birchcliff’s future performance and future performance may not compare to Birchcliff’s performance in previous periods and therefore should not be unduly relied upon.

Such forward-looking statements have been made by Birchcliff in light of the information available to it at the time the statements were made and reflect its experience and perception of historical trends. All statements and information other than historical fact may be forward-looking statements. Such forward-looking statements are often, but not always, identified by the use of words such as “seek”, “plan”, “expect”, “project”, “intend”, “believe”, “anticipate”, “estimate”, “forecast”, “potential”, “proposed”, “predict”, “budget”, “continue”, “targeting”, “may”, “will”, “could”, “might”, “should” and other similar words and expressions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By their nature, forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause actual results or events to differ materially from those anticipated in such forward-looking statements. Accordingly, readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on such forward-looking statements. Although Birchcliff believes that the expectations reflected in the forward-looking statements are reasonable, there can be no assurance that such expectations will prove to be correct and Birchcliff makes no representation that actual results achieved will be the same in whole or in part as those set out in the forward-looking statements.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With respect to the forward-looking statements contained in this press release, assumptions have been made regarding, among other things: prevailing and future commodity prices and differentials, currency exchange rates, interest rates, inflation rates, royalty rates and tax rates; the state of the economy, financial markets and the exploration, development and production business; the political environment in which Birchcliff operates; the regulatory framework regarding royalties, taxes and environmental laws; future cash flow, debt and dividend levels; future operating, transportation, marketing, G&A and other expenses; Birchcliff’s ability to access capital and obtain financing on acceptable terms; the timing and amount of capital expenditures and the sources of funding for capital expenditures and other activities; the sufficiency of budgeted capital expenditures to carry out planned operations; the successful and timely implementation of capital projects; results of future operations; Birchcliff’s ability to continue to develop its assets and obtain the anticipated benefits therefrom; the performance of existing and future wells, well production rates and well decline rates; success rates for future drilling; reserves and resource volumes and Birchcliff’s ability to replace and expand reserves through acquisition, development or exploration; the impact of competition on Birchcliff; the availability of, demand for and cost of labour, services and materials; the ability to obtain any necessary regulatory or other approvals in a timely manner; the satisfaction by third parties of their obligations to Birchcliff; the ability of Birchcliff to secure adequate transportation for its products; Birchcliff’s ability to market oil and gas; the availability of hedges on terms acceptable to Birchcliff; and natural gas market exposure. In addition to the foregoing assumptions, Birchcliff has made the following assumptions with respect to certain forward-looking statements contained in this press release:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">* With respect to the Acquisition, Birchcliff has assumed that the closing conditions to the Acquisition will be satisfied or waived and that the Acquisition will be completed on the terms and the timing anticipated. In addition, Birchcliff has made assumptions regarding the performance and other characteristics of the assets to be acquired and the expected benefits of the Acquisition.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">* Birchcliff’s preliminary 2019 guidance (as announced on November 14, 2018) assumes the following commodity prices during 2019: an average WTI price of US$70.00/bbl; an average WTI-MSW differential of $16.00; an average AECO price of $1.85/MMBtu; an average Dawn price of $3.69/MMBtu; an average NYMEX-Henry Hub price of US$3.00/MMBtu; and an exchange rate (CDN$ to US$1) of 1.28.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">* Birchcliff’s 2018 guidance (as updated November 14, 2018) assumes the following commodity prices during 2018: an average WTI price of US$66.67/bbl; an average AECO price of $1.63/MMBtu; an average Dawn price of $3.70/MMBtu; and an average wellhead natural gas price of $2.41/Mcf.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">* With respect to estimates of 2018 capital expenditures, statements that Birchcliff’s 2018 adjusted funds flow is expected to exceed its 2018 capital expenditures and Birchcliff’s preliminary spending plans for 2019, such estimates, statements and plans are based on the following: ° Estimates of capital expenditures and any allocation thereof assume that Birchcliff’s capital programs will be carried out as currently contemplated. In addition, Birchcliff’s estimate of 2019 F&D capital spending plus the Acquisition assumes that the Acquisition is completed as currently contemplated. ° Statements that Birchcliff’s 2018 adjusted funds flow is expected to exceed its 2018 capital expenditures assume that: the 2018 capital program will be carried out as currently contemplated; and the production targets, commodity mix, natural gas market exposure and commodity price assumptions set forth herein are met. ° Birchcliff makes acquisitions and dispositions in the ordinary course of business. Any acquisitions and dispositions completed could have an impact on Birchcliff’s capital expenditures, production, adjusted funds flow, free funds flow, costs and total debt, which impact could be material. The amount and allocation of capital expenditures for exploration and development activities by area and the number and types of wells to be drilled is dependent upon results achieved and is subject to review and modification by management on an ongoing basis throughout the year. Actual spending may vary due to a variety of factors, including commodity prices, economic conditions, results of operations and costs of labour, services and materials. Birchcliff will monitor economic conditions and commodity prices and, where deemed prudent, will adjust its capital programs to respond to changes in commodity prices and other material changes in the assumptions underlying such programs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">* With respect to Birchcliff’s production guidance for 2018 and 2019, such guidance assumes that: Birchcliff’s capital spending programs will be carried out as currently contemplated; no unexpected outages occur in the infrastructure that Birchcliff relies on to produce its wells and that any transportation service curtailments or unplanned outages that occur will be short in duration or otherwise insignificant; the construction of new infrastructure meets timing and operational expectations; existing wells continue to meet production expectations; and future wells scheduled to come on production meet timing, production and capital expenditure expectations. Birchcliff’s production guidance may be affected by acquisition and disposition activity and acquisitions and dispositions could occur that may impact expected production.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">* With respect to Birchcliff’s estimates of adjusted and free funds flow for 2019 and statements that Birchcliff expects to generate significant free funds flow during 2019, such estimates and statements assume that: the level of capital spending for 2019 set forth herein will be achieved; and the production targets, commodity mix, natural gas market exposure and commodity price assumptions set forth herein are met.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">* With respect to statements of future wells to be drilled and brought on production, the key assumptions are: the continuing validity of the geological and other technical interpretations performed by Birchcliff’s technical staff, which indicate that commercially economic volumes can be recovered from Birchcliff’s lands as a result of drilling future wells; and that commodity prices and general economic conditions will warrant proceeding with the drilling of such wells.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">* With respect to statements regarding the future potential and prospectivity of properties and assets, such statements assume: the continuing validity of the geological and other technical interpretations determined by Birchcliff’s technical staff with respect to such properties; and that, over the long-term, commodity prices and general economic conditions will warrant proceeding with the exploration and development of such properties. Birchcliff’s actual results, performance or achievements could differ materially from those anticipated in the forward-looking statements as a result of both known and unknown risks and uncertainties including, but not limited to: general economic, market and business conditions which will, among other things, impact the demand for and market prices of Birchcliff’s products and Birchcliff’s access to capital; volatility of crude oil and natural gas prices; fluctuations in currency and interest rates; stock market volatility; loss of market demand; an inability to access sufficient capital from internal and external sources; fluctuations in the costs of borrowing; operational risks and liabilities inherent in oil and natural gas operations; the occurrence of unexpected events such as fires, equipment failures and other similar events affecting Birchcliff or other parties whose operations or assets directly or indirectly affect Birchcliff; uncertainty that development activities in connection with its assets will be economical; uncertainties associated with estimating oil and natural gas reserves and resources; the accuracy of oil and natural gas reserves estimates and estimated production levels; geological, technical, drilling, construction and processing problems; uncertainty of geological and technical data; horizontal drilling and completions techniques and the failure of drilling results to meet expectations for reserves or production; uncertainties related to Birchcliff’s future potential drilling locations; potential delays or changes in plans with respect to exploration or development projects or capital expenditures, including delays in the completion of Birchcliff’s gas plants and other facilities; the accuracy of cost estimates and variances in Birchcliff’s actual costs and economic returns from those anticipated; incorrect assessments of the value of acquisitions (including the Acquisition) and exploration and development programs; changes in tax laws, Crown royalty rates, environmental laws, carbon tax regimes, incentive programs and other regulations that affect the oil and natural gas industry and other actions by government authorities; the cost of compliance with current and future environmental laws; political uncertainty and uncertainty associated with government policy changes; uncertainties and risks associated with pipeline restrictions and outages to third-party infrastructure that could cause disruptions to production; the inability to secure adequate production transportation for Birchcliff’s products; the inability to satisfy obligations under Birchcliff’s firm marketing and transportation arrangements or other agreements; shortages in equipment and skilled personnel; the absence or loss of key employees; competition for, among other things, capital, acquisitions of reserves, undeveloped lands, equipment and skilled personnel; management of Birchcliff’s growth; environmental risks, claims and liabilities; uncertainties associated with the outcome of litigation or other proceedings involving Birchcliff; uncertainties associated with credit facilities and counterparty credit risk; non-performance or default by counterparties; risks associated with Birchcliff’s hedging program and the risk that hedges on terms acceptable to Birchcliff may not be available; risks associated with the declaration and payment of dividends, including the discretion of Birchcliff’s board of directors to declare dividends and change the Corporation’s dividend policy; the failure to obtain any required approvals in a timely manner or at all; the risks that the closing conditions to the Acquisition may not be satisfied or that the Acquisition may not be completed as contemplated or at all; the failure to realize the anticipated benefits of acquisitions (including the Acquisition) and dispositions and the risk of unforeseen difficulties in integrating acquired assets into Birchcliff’s operations; negative public perception of the oil and natural gas industry, including transportation, hydraulic fracturing and fossil fuels; and the availability of insurance and the risk that certain losses may not be insured.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CALGARY—The city is facing a tight budget over the next four-year funding cycle as the effects of Alberta's oil and gas slump continue to echo.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">City manager Jeff Fielding said the plan is about operating in a “restrained and constrained” capital environment. He called the plan a “responsible budget” based on the city's current economic circumstances.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I don't have a lot of room to manoeuvre in this budget,” he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The total capital budget for this upcoming four-year cycle is $5.2 billion, with about $2.1 billion rolling over from capital commitments in previous years. The total new capital ask to fund projects over the next four years adds up to $1.9 billion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">City council will see the public presentation of the budget on Wednesday and debate the details during the week of Nov. 26.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">TRANSIT</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The city's transit system is expected to face more riders over the next four years. And while it'll see noticeable increases to its operating budget — 10 per cent in 2019, and three per cent for subsequent years — public transit will see a reduction to capital funding.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Buses will be used past their 16-year optimum lifespan, according to the budget, and four-car CTrain service will gradually be brought down to three-car, as 46 cars that have moved beyond their lifespan are decommissioned. Budget documents say Calgary Transit's reliability could go down, and there will be decreases to building and major facility maintenance.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">HOUSING</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Affordable housing is looking at a $31-million boost, contingent on $75 million in grants from the province and feds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">TAXES</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Property taxes are going up: 3.45 per cent in 2019, and 3 per cent for the remaining three years of the budget. For the average household, this'll translate to an increase of roughly $60 per year, according to the City of Calgary. The average residential customer could see a slight decrease in their hydro bill, but an increase to waste and recycling costs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The ongoing tax shift from downtown office towers to non-residential properties outside the core isn't making its way into the budget. Fielding said city administration will recommend the city once again draw from its reserve funds to cap increases to property owners. It isn't clear exactly how much they'll need, but Fielding said the city likely won't be able to hold increases at 5 per cent, as has been done in the past.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">INFRASTRUCTURE AND CAPITAL PROJECTS</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are still numerous infrastructure projects council is considering — such as a new arena and entertainment district, renovations to the BMO Centre and Arts Commons renovations — that aren't included in the budget. Council will discuss whether they want to determine a funding source for that work moving forward.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">POLICE AND EMERGENCY SERVICES</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Calgary's police operating budget isn't seeing any decreases. It'll hold at just over $401 million in 2019, and see a 2 per cent increase in both 2021 and 2022. That translates to 60 new full-time equivalent positions for each of the last two years of the budget cycle, but it's unclear whether that means more front-line officers or other staff.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are additional officers in the latter two years, afforded through the community growth portion of the indicative tax rate</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">However, Calgary's fire and emergency response service operating budget is getting a 5 per cent cut in 2019, although it'll see a 3 per cent increase in 2020 and a 5 per cent increase in 2021. And between 2020 and 2021, the Calgary Fire Department expects to hire 102 full-time equivalent positions. (Again, it isn't clear whether these are front-line firefighters or other staff.)</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CALGARY, Alberta, Nov. 14, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- <span class="companylink">Foremost Income Fund</span> ("Foremost" or the "Fund") announces the financial results for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2018.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Overview</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Fund is an unincorporated open end mutual fund trust conducting its business through two operating segments, Foremost Energy Equipment (FEE) and Foremost Mobile Equipment (FME). FEE, with its focus on the oil and gas industry in Western Canada, consists of three active manufacturing and service locations across Alberta. The locations manufacture oil-treating systems, shop tanks, field tanks, compression equipment, oil and gas process-treating equipment, and gas separators. FME manufactures and services hydrovac and vacuum trucks and equipment; off-highway, large-wheeled and tracked vehicles; and equipment for the custom drilling, construction, water well, and mining sectors. FME focuses on custom-built vehicles for its global clientele whom it serves through two manufacturing and service locations across Alberta.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Message to Unitholders</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A Positive Third Quarter for 2018Rising revenue and margins contributed to Foremost delivering a positive net income in the 3rd quarter of 2018. The Western Canadian energy sector outlook continues to be a challenging one for Foremost Energy Equipment, but a tight focus on fixed and project costs has helped improve bottom line. Growth in the US and International markets has helped drive sales of mining equipment, dual rotary rigs, and vacuum trucks for Foremost Mobile Equipment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The overview: key measurements</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Revenue—is $42.8 million. This is an increase of 20% from the second quarter of 2018 ($35.7 million) and 31% over the same quarter last year ($32.3 million).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Gross margin—increased to 15% during the third quarter as both FME and FEE financials improved over the prior year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SG&A expenses—7% of revenue, a drop from the 9% average as revenue increased.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">EBIDTA—is $3.4 million ($5.6 million for the year).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A strong sales directionOverall, the business has moved towards higher margins and increasing market share by:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">* healthyvacuum truck sales, which are increasing over last year’s average sales.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">* dual rotary sales in the US and South America, increasing from last quarter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">* mining tool sales worldwide, which have grown from higher global mining activity and companies replacing capital equipment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">* shop tank sales, as drilling activity in Western Canada remains active. A positive outlookForemost remains in a strong cash position and is maintaining a conservative but forward-looking approach to new investments in automation and strategic projects. I am satisfied we are progressing in key areas while we diligently work to improve others.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Kevin Johnson President</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q3 2018 Highlights</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">* Revenue increased by $10.5 million quarter over quarter. The revenue within the FME segment increased by $6.9 million, as drill, parts and truck volume increased. The FEE segment increased by $3.6 million, driven from demand in the shop tank product line and completion of field tank work. For the third quarter of 2018, the FME segment accounted for 65% of the revenue, consistent with the 64% in the same quarter of 2017. You can find more information in the Segmented Results of Operations section of the MD&A.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">* Gross profit increased $4.0 million, and 7%, quarter over quarter. You can find more information in the Segmented Results of Operations section of the MD&A.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">* Administration costs as a percentage of revenue dropped from 9% to 7%, but increased by $0.2 million. This increase is from marketing efforts, HR initiatives and personnel costs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">* During the three months ended September 30, 2018, the Fund recognized a $0.1 million foreign exchange loss (2017—$0.1 million loss). This loss reflects changes in the value of the Fund’s U.S. dollar-denominated net monetary assets and liabilities, along with the change in value for forward contracts. </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Temporary Reduction of Monthly Limit for Fund Unit Redemptions Pursuant to Section 6.4(ii)(A) and (B) of the Deed of Trust</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pursuant to section 6.4(ii)(A) and (B) of the Deed of Trust of the Fund dated November 12, 2005 as amended (the “Deed of Trust”), the Trustees of the Fund have discretion, in any calendar month, to reduce the monthly limit for cash redemptions of units of the Fund due to a material change, or concerns as to the current working capital or debt of the Fund. The exercise of such discretion may result in all or a portion (on a pro rata basis, depending on notices of redemption received) of the amount payable for units redeemed being paid by unsecured promissory notes in accordance with section 6.5 of the Deed of Trust.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As disclosed by prior press releases, effective May 1, 2014 and applying to all notices of redemption received in the months of May through October 2014, inclusive, and February 2015 through March 2018, inclusive, the Trustees of the Fund exercised their discretion pursuant to section 6.4(ii)(B) to reduce the monthly limit for cash redemptions from $1,500,000.00 to $0.00, to $500,000.00 for the months of November and December 2014 and January 2015, to $250,000.00 for the months of April to September 2018, and to $350,000.00 for the month of October 2018 (in each case the subject redemptions being payable by the end of the following month). The Trustees undertook to review the revised monthly limit in respect of the month of November 2018 no later than November 15, 2018.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With respect to the month of November 2018, the Trustees have determined that the monthly limit for cash redemptions will be set at $350,000.00. The Trustees have undertaken to review the revised monthly limit in respect of the month of December 2018 no later than December 14, 2018. In accordance with the Deed of Trust, unitholders that submit or have submitted notices of redemption during the month of November 2018, such that the Fund is obligated to pay the redemption price in respect of the subject units on or before December 28, 2018.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Regarding notices of redemption received in the month of November, the Fund will redeem up to $350,000.00 of units for cash. If notices of redemption received in November exceed $350,000.00, then the unitholders that have submitted notices of redemption in November will be contacted and provided with an opportunity to withdraw all or any part of such notices of redemption. Thereafter, to the extent notices of redemption remain in excess of $350,000.00, the subject units will be redeemed in part for cash and in part for unsecured promissory notes on a pro rata basis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This discussion is intended for summary purposes only and is subject in all respects to the Deed of Trust. The income and other tax consequences of holding, redeeming or disposing of units and acquiring promissory notes will vary depending on the unitholder’s particular circumstances, including the jurisdiction(s) in which the unitholder resides or carries on business, and whether the unitholder is an RRSP, RESP, RRIF, DPSP or TFSA. Accordingly, this summary is of a general nature only and is not intended to be legal or tax advice to any prospective purchaser or any unitholder. All unitholders should consult their own legal and tax advisors prior to redeeming units of the Fund.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Calgary’s bid for the 2026 Winter Games is over after voters decisively rejected the Olympic movement and promises that the event would be an economic boon for the struggling city.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">About 56 per cent of Calgarians who cast ballots in a plebiscite on Tuesday voted against continuing with the bid, which had the support of a well-funded Yes campaign and Mayor Naheed Nenshi, who argued the proposed bid was a good deal that would see more than $2-billion in federal and provincial money flow into projects the city needs. Instead, Calgarians appeared swayed by concerns that the city’s battered economy could not afford the multibillion-dollar event.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The vote is a rebuke for the <span class="companylink">International Olympic Committee</span> from a city that prides itself as a winter sports capital and leaves only Stockholm and a joint Italian bid in contention for the 2026 Games. Three other cities — one in Austria and two in Switzerland — previously held votes on whether to bid for the Olympics in 2026 and their residents similarly rejected the idea.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Nenshi said he was disappointed by the outcome but the result was clear. While the plebiscite was non-binding, he said city council would likely vote to suspend the bid on Monday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We saw a clear number, we saw a clear voter turnout, and I take my direction from citizens,” Mr. Nenshi told reporters at city hall. “Clearly, the citizens thought this wasn’t the right project at this time."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The campaigns for and against the Olympic bid communicated two widely divergent messages in the weeks before Tuesday’s vote. The Yes side tapped into near universal nostalgia for the successful 1988 Games.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The No side stressed that the city and its residents could not afford the estimated $5.1-billion cost of throwing a two-week party. They pointed to Calgary’s downtown, where more than a quarter of the city’s office space sits empty. Calgarians have endured years of economic stagnation in the face of persistently low oil prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“It was a battle of heart versus mind," said Duane Bratt, the chair of policy studies at Calgary’s Mount Royal University. "People want to support the Games, but they’re concerned about the costs. The last-minute deal has scared some people. If this was 2014 Calgary, this would be a slam-dunk Yes, but this isn’t 2014.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Erin Waite, an organizer for the main opposition group, said Calgarians had been turned off by a disorganized bid process and the financial risk of hosting the Olympics.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“When they looked at information beyond the emotional idea of hosting an Olympics, they realized that it’s not the right project for Calgary today and there are other things we can do with a major investment,” Ms. Waite said in an interview.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She said the vote was a chance for Calgarians to decide what the city’s priorities should be. Instead of the Olympics, which was expected to tie-up most of Calgary’s investment budget for the next decade, members of the No side pointed to the city’s new gleaming central library as an example of where the money could go to instead.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Waite also said the vote should send a message to the <span class="companylink">International Olympic Committee</span>. “I would hope that the <span class="companylink">IOC</span> gets a strong message from this… I think they have a lot of work to do to make the experience of the Olympics good for athletes and for people that aren’t directly participating. It’s just too big and truly a circus.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Calgary 2026 bid corporation, whose leadership appeared surprised with the level of opposition and negativity they faced ahead of the vote, heralded the process as invaluable for a city in search of a “new vision of hope.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We really wanted this dream for Calgary to host the Olympic and Paralympic Games," said Mary Moran, the CEO of Calgary 2026. "We learned so much about our community. We learned so much about each other."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A statement from Calgary 2026 said the bid corporation would wrap up operations in the coming weeks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Alberta Culture and Tourism Minister Ricardo Miranda said the province would respect the wishes of Calgary’s voters. Premier Rachel Notley had made a successful plebiscite a requirement for the city to receive provincial funding.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While council and Mr. Nenshi had promised Calgarians that they would see a funding deal for the games at least 30 days before the plebiscite, the three levels of government did not agree to a proposal until late October.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The public was expected to spend $2.875-billion on the Games if Calgary was chosen as host: $1.45-billion from the federal government and $700-million from Alberta. Calgary has been asked to put forward $390-million, along with a $200-million insurance policy against overruns. After the deal was reached, a majority of the council voted against continuing the bid, though that fell short of the two-thirds threshold required to kill it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Venues left over from Calgary’s 1988 Olympics were the backbone of the bid. To keep costs down, the bid proposed refurbishing 11 of those venues in the city and the Rocky Mountains west of Calgary.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Games would have required the construction of only two new arenas and an athletes village that would eventually become more than 1,000-units of affordable housing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Before the vote, Mr. Nenshi argued cost overruns would be unlikely because of a $1-billion cushion built into the budget and further contingencies. Both Ottawa and the Alberta government had said they would not cover cost overruns.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The two remaining bids for the 2026 Games are Stockholm, Sweden, and a combined proposal from the northern Italian cities of Milan and Cortina d’Ampezzo. The <span class="companylink">International Olympic Committee</span> accepted the Italian bid in early November despite a lack of financial support from the country’s federal government. The IOC president noted the Italian offer, near the Olympic group’s Swiss home, was “very strong.” The <span class="companylink">IOC</span> will vote to award the 2026 Games in June.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CALGARY, Alberta, Nov. 14, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- <span class="companylink">Pan Orient Energy Corp</span>. (“Pan Orient” or the “Company”) (POE – TSXV) reports 2018 third quarter consolidated financial and operating results. Please note that all amounts are in Canadian dollars unless otherwise stated and BOPD refers to barrels of oil per day.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Company is today filing its unaudited consolidated financial statements as at and for the nine months ended September 30, 2018 and related management’s discussion and analysis with Canadian securities regulatory authorities. Copies of these documents may be obtained online at or the Company’s website, .</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Commenting today on Pan Orient’s 2018 third quarter results, President and CEO Jeff Chisholm stated: “With the recent oil discovery in Concession L53 onshore Thailand and the commencement of road construction for the Anggun-1X exploration well in Indonesia, it is shaping up to be a very exciting next seven to eight months.” HIGHLIGHTS FOR THE FIRST NINE MONTHS OF 2018</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">* For the Anggun-1X exploration well at the East Jabung Production Sharing Contract (“PSC”) in Indonesia, where Pan Orient is non-operator with a 49% ownership interest, road construction commenced at the beginning of November and the operator estimates that drilling will commence sometime between March 15 and May 15, 2019 depending on road construction during the rainy season. The joint venture is in the process to extend the exploration period for an additional four years when the six year exploration period ends on January 19, 2019, subject to Government of Indonesia approval.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">* At the Thailand Joint Venture (where Pan Orient has a 50.01% equity interest) a two well program was completed early in the fourth quarter of 2018 with an oil discovery from the L53-DD1 exploration well and a successful L53-DD2 appraisal well. Government of Thailand approval was received for a 90 day production test of the L53-DD1 well and approval for L53-DD2 is expected shortly. The submission for a new L53DD production license which encompasses the discovery area is anticipated in early December 2018.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">* Oil sales, net to Pan Orient’s 50.01% interest in the Thailand Joint Venture for Concession L53, were 210 BOPD for the first nine months of 2018, with funds flow from operations of $3.1 million ($54.31 per barrel).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">* Total corporate funds flow from operations for the first nine months of 2018 was $2.5 million, including Pan Orient’s 50.01% equity interest in the Thailand Joint Venture, and the net loss attributable to common shareholders was $1.4 million ($0.03 loss per share).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">* Pan Orient maintains a strong financial position for planned exploration activities at the East Jabung PSC in Indonesia with working capital and non-current deposits at September 30, 2018 of $33.0 million and no long-term debt. In addition, net to Pan Orient’s 50.01% equity interest in the Thailand Joint Venture is $6.6 million of working capital and non-current deposits to fund exploration and development activities at Concession L53. 2018 THIRD QUARTER OPERATING RESULTS</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">* Net loss attributable to common shareholders for the third quarter of 2018 of $1.0 million ($0.02 loss per share) compared with $0.2 million ($0.00 loss per share) in the second quarter of 2018 and $1.8 million ($0.03 loss per share) in the third quarter of 2017. The change from the second quarter of 2018 is largely due to a foreign exchange loss of $368,000 in the third quarter of 2018 compared with a foreign exchange gain of $478,000 in the second quarter of 2018 as a result of a lower foreign exchange rate for Pan Orient’s US dollar holdings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">* For the third quarter of 2018, the Company recorded total corporate funds flow from operations, which includes the economic results of the 50.01% interest in the Thailand joint venture, of $0.4 million ($0.01 per share) compared with $1.3 million ($0.02 per share) in the second quarter of 2018.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">* Pan Orient had capital expenditures of $1.1 million in the third quarter of 2018, with $1.0 million in Indonesia primarily associated with the Anggun-1X exploration well and $0.2 million in Canada at the Sawn Lake SAGD property of Pan Orient’s 71.8% subsidiary <span class="companylink">Andora Energy Corporation</span> (“Andora”). In addition, Pan Orient’s share of Thailand joint venture capital expenditures was $0.9 million for workover activity and construction costs for the L53-DD1 exploration well related to the access road and site, which was recorded in Investment in Thailand Joint Venture.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">* At September 30, 2018 Pan Orient had $33.0 million of working capital and non-current deposits. Working capital and non-current deposits were comprised of $31.5 million cash, $3.8 million of Indonesian and Canadian accounts and taxes receivable, $0.6 million of non-current deposits, and less accounts payable of $2.9 million. In addition to this, Pan Orient’s Investment in Thailand Joint Venture has $6.6 million of working capital and non-current deposits and $2.2 million of equipment inventory to be utilized for future Thailand Joint Venture operations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">* Results net to Pan Orient’s 50.01% interest in the Thailand Joint Venture for Concession L53</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">* Concession L53 is a low cost operation that benefits from higher Brent crude oil reference prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">* Average oil sales of 214 BOPD during the third quarter of 2018 generated $1.2 million in funds flow from operations, or $60.22 per barrel. This compares with 235 BOPD and $1.2 million of funds flow from operations, or $57.97 per barrel, in the second quarter of 2018. The average realized sales price per barrel increased 6% from $86.74 in the second quarter of 2018 to $92.34 in the third quarter of 2018.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">* Per barrel amounts during the third quarter of 2018 were a realized price for oil sales of $92.34, transportation expenses of $1.83, operating expenses of $15.37, general and administrative expenses of $10.28 and a 5% royalty to the Thailand government of $4.58. Oil sales revenue during this period was allocated 30% to expenses for transportation, operating, general & administrative and other, 5% to the government of Thailand for royalties, and 65% to the Thailand Joint Venture.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">East Jabung PSC, Onshore Sumatra (Pan Orient 49% ownership & Non Operator)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Anggun-1X exploration well is primarily targeting the Gumai sandstone level at a location 4.6 kilometers northwest and 80 meters structurally up-dip of the Ayu-1X exploration well which was drilled in 2017. The estimated dry hole cost is US$15.4 million (with Pan Orient’s 49% share of US$7.55 million). The quarry permit that was required in order to commence construction of the Anggun-1X exploration well access road has been approved and road construction has commenced. The operator estimates the Anggun-1X exploration well will commence drilling sometime between March 15 and May 15, 2019. The variation in timing is almost entirely a function of possible issues relating to road building during the rainy season. Anggun-1X is anticipated to take approximately 30 days to reach total depth with testing to commence immediately thereafter, if required.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As per the requirement under the East Jabung PSC to enter into the four year exploration period extension, the joint venture has submitted the final acreage relinquishment to the Government of Indonesia oil and gas regulator (“SKKMIGAS”) bringing the remaining PSC area to 1,254.54 square kilometers, representing 20% of the original PSC area. Once this relinquishment area has been reviewed and approved by the SKKMIGAS technical group, the joint venture will notify the Government of Indonesia of their election to enter into the four year exploration extension period that will commence when the six year exploration period ends on January 20, 2019. During the four year exploration extension period, the joint venture has the option of exiting or continuing with the PSC on an annual basis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">THAILAND</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Concession L53 Onshore (Pan Orient Energy (Siam) Ltd., in which Pan Orient has 50.01% ownership)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An oil discovery in October with the L53-DD1 exploration well was followed up with a successful appraisal well at L53-DD2. L53DD is located in the northern most portion of the Concession L53 “exploration reserve area”; approximately 28 kilometers north of any existing producing wells within Concession L53 and approximately 5 kilometers south of the <span class="companylink">PTT Exploration and Production Public Company Limited</span> operated U-Thong oil field located in the adjacent concession. An application has been submitted for Government of Thailand approval for a 90 day production test of the L53-DD1 and L53-DD2 wells, and L53-DD1 approval has been received. This will be followed by the submission of an L53DD production license area application that will encompass the discovery area and generation of the technical information to be provided to the Company’s reserve evaluators for inclusion of the L53DD discovery into the year-end 2018 independent reserves evaluation. Past experience has typically seen government approval of production licenses within three to five months of submission, at which time long term (not subject to 90 day production test) production can commence. In addition, work is currently underway utilizing the L53-DD1 and L53-DD2 well results to better define the hydrocarbon potential in the immediate vicinity of the L53-DD1 oil discovery that would form the basis for any potential future exploration drilling in the area.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The drilling of an appraisal well at L53B has been postponed due to the discovery with the L53-DD1 exploration well. Production of the existing L53-B discovery well will commence upon the in-country arrival of a variable speed control panel anticipated in December 2018.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Shareholders will be informed of the production test results for L53-DD1 and L53-DD2 after approximately the first seven to ten days of testing. At that time, a preliminary Thailand 2019 drilling program will also be outlined to Pan Orient shareholders.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CANADA</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sawn Lake (Operated by Andora, in which Pan Orient has a 71.8% ownership)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pan Orient continues to work with joint venture partners to move forward towards potential commercial expansion to 3200 BOPD at the Sawn Lake, Alberta steam assisted gravity drainage (“SAGD”) project (in which Andora has a 50% working interest and is the operator). The current high differential between the West Texas Intermediate reference price for light crude oil and the Western Canada Select reference price for heavy Canadian crude oil is a challenging economic environment for heavy oil producers in Canada. The level and stability of heavy oil prices will have a significant impact on any decision by the Sawn Lake partners regarding the timing and extent of future development, and the ability to finance the project.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Corporate</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pan Orient is maintaining a strong cash balance, denominated mainly in United States dollar deposits, to conduct key exploration and development activities and ensure financial flexibility. Pan Orient continually reviews its exploration and development asset portfolio in Indonesia, Thailand and Canada with the aim of maximizing corporate value and achieving the best allocation of resources.</p>

 (1)      Pan Orient holds a 50.01% equity interest in Pan Orient Energy (Siam) Ltd. as a joint arrangement where the Company shares joint control with the 49.99% equity interest holder.  The resulting joint arrangement is classified as a Joint Venture under IFRS 11 and is accounted for using the equity method of accounting where Pan Orient’s 50.01% equity interest in the assets, liabilities, working capital, operations and capital expenditures of Pan Orient Energy (Siam) Ltd. are recorded in Investment in Thailand Joint Venture.
 
 (2)      As set out in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows in the unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements of <span class="companylink">Pan Orient Energy Corp</span>.  
 
 (3)      Refer to Commitments in Note 11 of the September 30, 2018 and Note 12 of the September 30, 2017 Notes to the Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.
 
 (4)      Total corporate funds flow from operations is cash flow from operating activities prior to changes in non-cash working capital, decommissioning expenditures and settlements, unrealized foreign exchange gain or loss plus the corresponding amount from the Thailand operations which is recorded in Joint Venture for financial statement purposes.  This measure is used by management to analyze operating performance and leverage.  Funds flow as presented does not have any standardized meaning prescribed by IFRS and therefore it may not be comparable with the calculation of similar measures of other entities.  Funds flow is not intended to represent operating cash flow or operating profits for the period nor should it be viewed as an alternative to cash flow from operating activities, net earnings or other measures of financial performance calculated in accordance with IFRS. 
 
 (5)      Cost of capital expenditures, excluding decommissioning costs, the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates and capitalized stock-based compensation expense.
 
 (6)      In 2018, the Sawn Lake joint venture sold some inventory of pipe to outside third party.
 
 (7)      For the purpose of providing more meaningful economic results from operations for Thailand, the amounts presented include 50.01% of results of the Thailand joint venture.
 
 (8)      The Sawn Lake Demonstration Project in Alberta has not yet proven that it is commercially viable and all related costs and revenues are being capitalized as exploration and evaluation assets until commercial viability is achieved.
 
 (9)      General & administrative expenses, excluding non-cash accretion on decommissioning provision.  The nominal amount of G&A shown in the three and nine months ended 2017 and 2018 for Thailand operations related to G&A of the holding company of Pan Orient Energy (Siam) Ltd.
 
 (10)     Exploration expense relates to exploration costs associated with the Batu Gajah PSCs in Indonesia.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">(1) Non-IFRS financial measure. Please see discussion in the Non-IFRS Financial Measures section of Questor’s Management’s Discussion and Analysis for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Three Months Ended September 30, 2018</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Revenue in the third quarter of 2018 was consistent to the same period in 2017. The Company’s rental revenue increased to $4.3 million from $3.2 million. The Company’s service revenue increased to $0.7 million from $0.3 million. The increases in rental and service revenue were offset by a $1.4 million decrease in sales revenue.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Demand for Questor’s equipment in Colorado during the quarter was somewhat impacted by uncertainty and regulatory overhang associated with Proposition 112. Operators prioritized drilling over completions and flow-back programs during the quarter resulting in slightly lower demand for flow-back units. The Company estimates the impact was less than 5%. Due to the uncertainty of Proposition 112 (Prop 112) and potential impact to equipment requirements, the Company also decided to curtail capital expenditures during the quarter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Gross profit increased 21% versus the third quarter of 2017 as result of higher margin rental revenue offsetting lower margin sales revenue. Adjusted EBITDA increased $1.0 million as a result of increased gross profit and continued cost control of administrative expenses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nine Months Ended September 30, 2018</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2018 was $17.5 million, an increase of 38 percent from the same period in 2017. The Company’s rental revenue increased to $12.0 million from $6.8 million due to higher investment in the United States. The Company has invested $6.0 million in rental unit expansion since September 30, 2017 resulting in over 60% more rental units compared to the third quarter in 2017.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Gross profit increased by 56 percent as a result of higher rental revenue and service revenue. Gross margin as a percentage of revenue increased from 56% to 63%. The improvement is result of revenue mix. Rental revenue mix increased from 54% in 2017 to 69% in 2018, rental revenues carry lower cost of sales which resulted in improved overall margins and gross profit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Adjusted EBITDA and earnings increased $5.0 million and $2.8 million respectively due to the investment in the rental fleet and continued cost control of operational and administrative expenses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Company invested $4.0 million into the rental fleet in the nine months ended September 30, 2018. The new rental equipment has been mobilized to the United States.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CEO message</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Audrey Mascarenhas, Questor’s President and Chief Executive Officer commented “I am pleased to report that the Questor team has delivered strong results in the third quarter. Revenue, earnings and cash-flows have tracked consistently with the first half of the year. We are on pace for 2018 to be another record revenue and earnings year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The quarter started with reports from Colorado that a group was organizing an initiative that could bar oil and gas extraction on more than 80% of non-federal land in Colorado. Initiative 97 was aimed to increase distances wells have to be from occupied building and water sources by 1,500 to 2,500 feet. There was considerable opposition to the initiative as the oil and gas industry is an increasingly important part of the State’s economy. Over the past decade, Colorado's oil production has surged 365%. The initiative was estimated to cost the state 150,000 jobs and cut GDP by $218 billion. Backers of the measure needed to submit 98,000 valid signatures by August 6th for the measure to make the ballot to be voted on by the residents of Colorado. Organizers of the campaign gathered the required signatures to place an initiative on the ballot. The signatures were confirmed late August and as result Initiative 97 appeared on the ballot as Proposition 112 to be voted on November 6th. The residents of the State voted on November 6th, the result was 57% of the votes cast in favor of trouncing Prop 112. Colorado oil and gas companies landed a significant victory election night as voters rejected sweeping restrictions for the industry. The victory supports continued high activity levels in the basin and sustained strong demand for our equipment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Colorado has long been considered a leader with Regulation 7 which mandates the use of enclosed combustion and now targets methane, resulting in a statewide focus on the responsible management of potentially fugitive hydrocarbons. Regulation 7 has been a significant driver for Questors emissions solutions. The Company remains confident that Colorado will continue to be a strong market for our technology and solutions going forward.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Subsequent to the quarter, we have mobilized 10% of the rental fleet to North Dakota and have commenced operations in the State. North Dakota (ND) is enforcing US EPA regulations that reward the use of high efficiency VOC emissions control and we are now seeing an increased demand well into 2019 in ND. Prior to the Prop 112 vote we felt is was prudent to evaluate our capital needs and briefly paused investment. With Prop 112 being rejected in Colorado and the significant demand in ND, this week, we recommenced the capital program and are currently building additional rental units that will be mobilized to both the Colorado and North Dakota markets. It is expected that we will continue to grow the rental fleet as well as establish an Operations hub in ND as demand continues to grow.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rental units are also scheduled to be mobilized to Texas in the fourth quarter of this year. Questor will continue to commit capital to grow a presence in regions where producers are looking for high performing, cost-effective technologies to manage their waste gas and fugitive emissions. The Permian Basin continues to be active while facing flaring restrictions in an area lacking sufficient infrastructure to handle the associated gas produced with the oil. This lack of pipeline take away capacity in the basin is creating interest in our rental equipment to deal with the gas. The opportunity for our technology solutions continues to grow and the team at Questor is well positioned to continue to deliver meaningful cost effective innovative solutions to meet our clients’ needs to deal with emissions.”</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CMG’s revenue is comprised of software license sales, which provide the majority of the Company’s revenue, and fees for professional services.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On April 1, 2018, the Company adopted IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers using the cumulative effect method, by recognizing the cumulative effect of initially applying IFRS 15 as an adjustment to the opening balance of equity at April 1, 2018. The Company recorded an increase to retained earnings of $0.7 million ($0.5 million net of tax), on April 1, 2018, due to earlier recognition of revenue on certain term-based software licenses. Under the cumulative effect method, comparative information is not restated and continues to be reported under the previous standard, IAS 18 Revenue. For more information, refer to note 3 of the Company’s condensed consolidated interim financial statements.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Total revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2018 remained flat compared to the same period of the previous fiscal year, due to a decrease in software license revenue offset by an increase in professional services revenue. Total revenue for the six months ended September 30, 2018 decreased by 6% compared to the same period of the previous fiscal year, as a decrease in software license revenue was partially offset by an increase in professional services revenue.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The adoption of IFRS 15 and the resultant early revenue recognition through opening equity had a negative impact of $0.2 million and $0.4 million on software license revenue for the three and six months ended September 30, 2018, respectively. The remainder of the decrease was due to the timing of revenue recognition on certain contracts.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Total software license revenue for the three and six months ended September 30, 2018 decreased by 2% and 8%, compared to the same periods of the previous fiscal year, due to decreases in annuity/maintenance license revenue.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CMG’s annuity/maintenance license revenue decreased by 8% and 9% during the three and six months ended September 30, 2018, compared to the same periods of the previous fiscal year, due to a decrease in Canada, as well as decreases in South America and the Eastern Hemisphere, which were caused mainly by the timing of revenue recognition on certain contracts. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in the United States.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Our annuity/maintenance license revenue can be significantly impacted by the variability of the amounts recorded from a long-standing customer and its affiliates for whom revenue recognition criteria are fulfilled only at the time of the receipt of funds. Due to the economic conditions in the country where this customer and its affiliates are located, revenue from them will continue to be recognized on a cash basis. The timing of such payments may skew the comparison of annuity/maintenance license revenue between periods. We received payments from these customers in the first and second quarters of the previous fiscal year, but none in the current year. Normalized for these receipts, annuity/maintenance license revenue for the three and six months ended September 30, 2018 decreased by 2% and 4%, respectively, instead of decreasing by 8% and 9%, compared to the same periods of the previous fiscal year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These normalized decreases of 2% and 4% were due to the timing of revenue recognition on certain contracts in the Eastern Hemisphere, as well as the negative impact of IFRS 15 adoption. Overall, when normalized for the receipts recognized into revenue on a cash basis, the timing differences on certain contracts and the impact of IFRS 15 adoption, annuity/maintenance license revenue for the three and six months ended September 30, 2018 grew by a low single-digit percentage. In addition, the movement in the CAD/USD exchange rate had a negative impact of approximately 2% and 3% on annuity/maintenance license revenue for the three and six months ended September 30, 2018, respectively.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Perpetual license revenue increased in the three and six months ended September 30, 2018, compared to the same periods of the previous fiscal year, as there were more perpetual sales realized in the Eastern Hemisphere and Canada. Software licensing under perpetual sales may fluctuate significantly between periods due to the uncertainty associated with the timing and the location where sales are generated. For this reason, even though we expect to achieve a certain level of aggregate perpetual sales on an annual basis, we expect to observe fluctuations in the quarterly perpetual revenue amounts throughout the fiscal year.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">During the three months ended September 30, 2018, as compared to the same period of the previous fiscal year, Canada and South America experienced a decrease in total software license revenue, which were partially offset by increases in the Eastern Hemisphere and the United States.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">During the six months ended September 30, 2018, as compared to the same period of the previous fiscal year, three regions experienced a decrease in total software license revenue, and revenue in the United States increased.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Canadian market (representing 25% of year-to-date software license revenue) experienced 15% and 11% decreases in annuity/maintenance license revenue during the three and six months ended September 30, 2018, respectively, compared to the same periods of the previous fiscal year, due to a reduction in licensing by some customers. Perpetual revenue increased in the current period, as there were no perpetual sales recognized in the comparative period.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The United States market (representing 30% of year-to-date software license revenue) experienced 4% and 1% increases in annuity/maintenance license revenue during the three and six months ended September 30, 2018, compared to the same periods of the previous fiscal year, despite the negative impact of IFRS 15 adoption. These increases are mainly a result of increased licensing by new and existing customers involved in unconventional shale and tight hydrocarbon recovery processes. Perpetual sales during the three and six months ended September 30, 2018 were consistent with the comparative periods.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">South America (representing 11% of year-to-date software license revenue) experienced a decrease of 28% in annuity/maintenance license revenue during the three and six months ended September 30, 2018, compared to the same periods of the previous fiscal year. Our revenue in South America can be significantly impacted by the variability of the amounts recorded from a customer and its affiliates for whom revenue is recognized only when cash is received. We received payments from these customers in the first and second quarters of the previous fiscal year, but none were received in the current year. To provide a normalized comparison, if we remove the revenue from this particular customer from the three and six months ended September 30, 2017, we note that the South American annuity/maintenance license revenue increased by 13% and 12% for the three and six months ended September 30, 2018, respectively, instead of decreasing by 28%. No perpetual sales were realized in South America during the three and six months ended September 30, 2018.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Eastern Hemisphere (representing 34% of year-to-date software license revenue) experienced 1% and 8% decreases in annuity/maintenance license revenue during the three and six months ended September 30, 2018, compared to the same periods of the previous fiscal year, mainly due to differences in the timing of revenue recognition on certain contracts, particularly during the first quarter of the current fiscal year. The Eastern Hemisphere’s perpetual license revenue for the three and six months ended September 30, 2018 was significantly higher than the same periods of the previous fiscal year, as a result of several perpetual sales realized during the second quarter of the current fiscal year.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CMG’s deferred revenue consists primarily of amounts for pre-sold licenses. With the exception of certain term-based software licenses that are recognized at the start of the license period, our annuity/maintenance revenue is deferred and recognized ratably over the license period, which is generally one year or less. Amounts are deferred for licenses that have been provided and revenue recognition reflects the passage of time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The above table illustrates the normal trend in the deferred revenue balance from the beginning of the calendar year (which corresponds with Q4 of our fiscal year), when most renewals occur, to the end of the calendar year (which corresponds with Q3 of our fiscal year). Our fourth quarter corresponds with the beginning of the fiscal year for most oil and gas companies, representing a time when they enter a new budget year and sign/renew their contracts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Deferred revenue as at Q2 of fiscal 2019 decreased by 2% compared to Q2 of fiscal 2018, primarily due to one significant multi-year contract that commenced during Q4 of fiscal 2017 and included a large upfront payment for future software use and lower payments during the remainder of the contract period.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">(1) Includes salaries, bonuses, stock-based compensation, benefits, commissions, and professional development. See “Non-IFRS Financial Measures”.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CMG’s total operating expenses decreased by 4% and 5% for the three and six months ended September 30, 2018, respectively, compared to the same periods of the previous fiscal year. The decrease for the three-month period was due to lower direct employee costs and the decrease for the six-month period was due to decreases in both direct employees costs and other corporate costs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Direct Employee Costs</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As a technology company, CMG’s largest area of expenditure is its people. Approximately 74% of total operating expenses for the six months ended September 30, 2018 related to direct employee costs. Staffing levels in the current fiscal year were slightly lower compared to the previous fiscal year. At September 30, 2018, CMG’s full-time equivalent staff complement was 191 employees and consultants, down from 196 full-time equivalent employees and consultants at September 30, 2017. Direct employee costs decreased during the three months ended September 30, 2018, compared to the same period of the previous fiscal year, due to a decrease in stock-based compensation expense. Direct employee costs decreased during the six months ended September 30, 2018, compared to the same period of the previous fiscal year, mainly due to a lower headcount.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other Corporate Costs</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other corporate costs for the three months ended September 30, 2018 remained consistent with the same period of the previous fiscal year. Other corporate costs for the six months ended September 30, 2018 decreased by 13% compared to the same period of the previous fiscal year, mainly because the comparative period included $0.6 million of non-recurring charges related to the move to the new headquarters.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Outlook</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">During the current quarter our total revenue was comparable to the same quarter of the previous year as a result of strong perpetual license sales and an increase in consulting activities, which offset a decrease in annuity and maintenance revenue. Current quarter’s operating profit and net income increased by 6% and 10%, respectively, compared to the same quarter of the previous year, mainly as a result of reduced expenses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The current quarter and year-to-date annuity and maintenance revenue continued to be negatively affected mainly by the timing differences of revenue recognition on certain contracts in South America and the Eastern Hemisphere and the change in accounting policy affecting the United States, contributing to a decrease in annuity and maintenance revenue of 8% and 9%, respectively. If normalized for those items, annuity and maintenance revenue experienced low single-digit growth on a world-wide basis. On a regional basis:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">* Canadian annuity and maintenance revenue continued to be under pressure both during the quarter and on a year-to-date basis as a result of economic uncertainty that has affected the region over the past number of years. While the instability of the market appears to have lessened, we are going to focus on demonstrating to customers the value of our simulation tools for optimizing their production particularly during challenging times. In addition, we will continue working with customers entering exploration and development of Canada’s unconventional hydrocarbon resources.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">* The United States region continues to benefit from strong activity by unconventional customers, and while we achieved growth both in the current quarter and year to date, the results in the region were negatively affected by a change in revenue recognition accounting policy and the movement in the CAD/USD exchange rate. We are positively encouraged by the activity in the region and will continue to strengthen our presence by promoting our unconventional modelling workflows.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">* South America grew by 13% during the quarter (12% year to date) after normalizing for payments from a customer for whom revenue is recognized only when cash is received, thus skewing the comparison between the periods.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">* Eastern Hemisphere annuity and maintenance revenue for the current quarter was comparable to the same period of the previous year, while declining on a year-to-date basis. Both periods – and the first quarter of the current fiscal year in particular – have been negatively affected by revenue recognition on contracts for usage of our products in prior quarters. Normalizing for these items, annuity and maintenance revenue grew by a low single-digit percentage in both periods. The Eastern Hemisphere was also negatively affected by the movement in foreign exchange. We continue to be optimistic about the additions we have made to our customer base throughout fiscal 2018 and into the first half of fiscal 2019, which contributed to low single-digit growth in year-to-date annuity/maintenance license revenue after normalizing for the items described above. In particular, we are optimistic about the US market, where we continue to work with both existing and new customers on modelling workflows for unconventional assets. In all regions, we continue to demonstrate to customers the importance of reservoir simulation as a value creation tool for their enterprises, especially in times of economic and regulatory uncertainty.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CMG’s year-to-date total operating expenses decreased by 5%, due mainly to the fact that the comparative period included $0.6 million of non-recurring charges related to the move to the new headquarters. The remaining decrease was due to lower employee and head office costs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We continue our efforts in marketing and trial modelling of CoFlow, our newest product that will provide a one-vendor solution for integrated asset modelling by combining reservoir, production networks and geomechanics in one environment. We continue identifying potential customers and performing trial modelling for them while <span class="companylink">Shell</span> is deploying and using the software on its selected assets. The CoFlow team continues to work on feature development and performance improvement.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We ended the second quarter of 2019 with a strong balance sheet, no debt and $52.3 million in cash. Subsequent to quarter end, CMG’s Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.10 per share.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Forward-looking Information</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Certain information included in this press release is forward-looking. Forward-looking information includes statements that are not statements of historical fact and which address activities, events or developments that the Company expects or anticipates will or may occur in the future, including such things as investment objectives and strategy, the development plans and status of the Company’s software development projects, the Company’s intentions, results of operations, levels of activity, future capital and other expenditures (including the amount, nature and sources of funding thereof), business prospects and opportunities, research and development timetable, and future growth and performance. When used in this press release, statements to the effect that the Company or its management “believes”, “expects”, “expected”, “plans”, “may”, “will”, “projects”, “anticipates”, “estimates”, “would”, “could”, “should”, “endeavours”, “seeks”, “predicts” or “intends” or similar statements, including “potential”, “opportunity”, “target” or other variations thereof that are not statements of historical fact should be construed as forward-looking information. These statements reflect management’s current beliefs with respect to future events and are based on information currently available to management of the Company. The Company believes that the expectations reflected in such forward-looking information are reasonable, but no assurance can be given that these expectations will prove to be correct and such forward-looking information should not be unduly relied upon.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Non-IFRS Financial Measures</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This press release includes certain measures which have not been prepared in accordance with IFRS such as “EBITDA”, “direct employee costs” and “other corporate costs.” Since these measures do not have a standard meaning prescribed by IFRS, they are unlikely to be comparable to similar measures presented by other issuers. Management believes that these indicators nevertheless provide useful measures in evaluating the Company’s performance.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Direct employee costs” include salaries, bonuses, stock-based compensation, benefits, commission expenses, and professional development. “Other corporate costs” include facility-related expenses, corporate reporting, professional services, marketing and promotion, computer expenses, travel, and other office-related expenses. Direct employee costs and other corporate costs should not be considered an alternative to total operating expenses as determined in accordance with IFRS. People-related costs represent the Company’s largest area of expenditure; hence, management considers highlighting separately corporate and people-related costs to be important in evaluating the quantitative impact of cost management of these two major expenditure pools.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“EBITDA” refers to net income before adjusting for depreciation expense, finance income, finance costs, and income and other taxes. EBITDA should not be construed as an alternative to net income as determined by IFRS. The Company believes that EBITDA is useful supplemental information as it provides an indication of the results generated by the Company’s main business activities prior to consideration of how those activities are amortized, financed or taxed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Funds flow from operations” is a non-IFRS financial measure that represents net income adjusted for certain non-cash items, such as depreciation expense, non-cash stock-based compensation expense, deferred tax expense (recovery) and deferred rent. The Company considers funds flow from operations a useful measure as it represents the cash generated during the period, regardless of the timing of collection of receivables and payment of payables, and demonstrates the Company’s ability to generate the cash flow necessary to fund future growth and dividend payments. Funds flow from operations may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other companies.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's too soon to say what the decision by U.S. District Judge Brian Morris last Thursday will mean to the timeline and cost of the pipeline, Paul Miller, liquids pipeline president, said at <span class="companylink">TransCanada</span>'s investor day in Toronto on Tuesday.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The project was proposed in 2008, denied by former president Barack Obama in 2015 (leading to a $2.9-billion non-cash writedown for <span class="companylink">TransCanada</span>) and resurrected by President Donald Trump in 2017.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's important to remember our commercial model on XL has not changed materially," Miller said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"All historical costs, plus (cost of construction), since 2009 are captured for toll determination. The writedown we took in 2015 does not remove these costs from rate-making purposes. We share capital cost variances equally with our shippers." He said the pipeline capacity, minus an amount that must be reserved for spot shipments, is now fully committed. Indigenous and environmental groups sued <span class="companylink">TransCanada</span> and the <span class="companylink">U.S. State Department</span> after Nebraska authorities approved an alternative route to the one <span class="companylink">TransCanada</span> had proposed through the state, arguing it hadn't properly studied it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In his decision, Morris agreed the analysis didn't fully cover the cumulative effects of greenhouse gas emissions, the effects of current oil prices on the pipeline's viability or include updated modelling of potential oil spills.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The proposed 1,897-kilometre pipeline would carry as much as 830,000 barrels a day of crude from Hardisty, Alta., to Steel City, Neb., where it would meet up with other pipelines to the U.S. Gulf Coast.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">TransCanada</span> is examining the deficiencies identified by the judge to determine what effect meeting them will have on the schedule and its last cost estimate of about $10 billion, Miller said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The lack of export pipeline access from Western Canada has been blamed for steep discounts for crude oil compared with New York-traded West Texas Intermediate, prompting some producers to reduce oil production and leading to record levels of crude-by-rail shipping.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Oilsands producer Cenovus Energy Inc. has called on the Alberta government to impose production cuts to bring supply in line with takeaway capacity and protect royalties, but companies with refineries that benefit from lower prices or contracted export pipeline space oppose the move.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"As far as timing around the pipeline, the need for Keystone XL has never been greater," Miller said at investor day.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"When you're looking at US$40 to $50 differentials on WCS (Western Canadian Select bitumen-blend oil) versus WTI, whether it's in this administration or the next administration, XL is a project that the industry needs and is a valuable piece of infrastructure for the North American economy."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">TransCanada</span> told investors it expects to raise its dividend at an average annual rate of eight to 10 per cent through 2021, an outlook supported by expected growth in earnings and cash flow.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Crude oil prices slumped for an unprecedented 12th straight day on Tuesday, sending Canadian energy stocks lower amid the prospect of weaker global demand but steady output from the world’s major oil producers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">West Texas Intermediate (WTI), a U.S. benchmark grade of oil, fell 7.1 per cent to US$55.69 – touching its lowest level in a year and marking its worst one-day decline in three years. It’s now down 28 per cent since its early October peak.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“It’s like a run on the bank,” said Phil Flynn, analyst at Price Futures Group in Chicago. “It’s getting to the point where it doesn’t seem to be about fundamentals any more, but a total collapse in price.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The downturn since the summer is the worst since crude oil fell to 12-year lows in early 2016, and it is having a particularly big impact on the Canadian energy sector, which has been reeling from a steep discount for the price of Western Canadian Select (WCS) oil, a Canadian benchmark that now trades at a fraction of WTI.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WCS was trading at US$15.69 a barrel late Tuesday. That’s just US$2 above its low in early 2016 and is down from a high of US$58 a barrel this summer, as Canadian oil producers face a glut at U.S. refineries and export bottlenecks due to delays in getting new pipelines approved.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last Thursday, a U.S. court in Montana blocked[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/business/article-us-judge-blocks-construction-of-keystone-xl-pipeline/] construction of <span class="companylink">TransCanada Corp</span>.'s Keystone XL pipeline, a 1,900-kilometre conduit for exporting oil from Alberta to Nebraska, citing environmental concerns. The ruling adds uncertainty to an $8-billion project that has already faced numerous delays.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Shares of <span class="companylink">Athabasca Oil Corp</span>., which analysts believe is one of the most sensitive companies to the price of WCS, fell 3.7 per cent. The share price touched a low of 99 cents in early trading on Tuesday, marking its lowest price since February.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But larger and more diversified Canadian producers were also hit hard. <span class="companylink">Suncor Energy Inc</span>. fell 2.8 per cent, reaching its lowest level since March. The shares have slumped 22 per cent since July 30. <span class="companylink">Canadian Natural Resources Ltd</span>. fell 3.1 per cent. The share price has fallen 26 per cent since July.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Oil prices are being affected by pressures that extend well beyond Canada’s inability to build additional pipelines.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Twelve [down] days in a row is insane − but there are a lot of pieces putting pressure on the market,” said Bob Yawger, director of energy futures at Mizuho, a Japanese-based financial firm. He noted that speculators have been abandoning bets that the price of oil will rebound.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Observers believe that slowing Chinese economic activity and a continuing trade war between China and the United States are partly to blame for lower demand for energy. Volatile stock markets and weaker U.S. home-building activity may also indicate that the U.S. economy is cooling.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Saudi Arabia’s Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih said on Monday that the <span class="companylink">Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries</span> at its December meeting should cut oil production by about one million barrels a day to avoid oversupplying the world’s demand in 2019, especially as non-OPEC producers, such as the United States, increase their output to record levels.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In its monthly report, released Tuesday, <span class="companylink">OPEC</span> cut its estimated demand for oil in 2019. It expects consumption will rise by 1.29 million barrels a day, down 70,000 barrels from its previous estimate. <span class="companylink">OPEC</span> also raised its estimate for output by 127,000 barrels a day, underscoring the potential mismatch between supply and demand.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite these concerns, U.S. President Donald Trump weighed in on Monday with demands that oil producers keep the taps open. Mr. Trump said on <span class="companylink">Twitter</span>: “Hopefully, Saudi Arabia and <span class="companylink">OPEC</span> will not be cutting oil production. Oil prices should be much lower based on supply!”</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">TransCanada Corp</span>. remains firmly committed to its US$8-billion Keystone XL project but it is too early to assess the impact that last week's negative court ruling will have on its schedule, company executives said Tuesday.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A federal judge in Montana last week quashed the presidential permit that had been issued by U.S. President Donald Trump, saying the State Department had failed to provide sufficient analysis and reasons for reversing former president Barack Obama's 2015 decision to reject the application.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">TransCanada</span> is also awaiting a decision from the Nebraska Supreme Court on a challenge to the state's approval of the Keystone XL route.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Throughout all this, we remain fully committed to KXL," Paul Miller, <span class="companylink">TransCanada</span>'s president for liquid pipelines, told investors Tuesday. “The need for KXL has never been greater," he added, noting the steep discount that Western Canadian producers are currently being forced to accept on their crude.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Western Canadian Select – the benchmark for oil sands crude – is currently trading at US$43.23 a barrel below the level for West Texas intermediate, according to Net Energy, a Calgary trading company. WTI has slumped after hitting a recent high-water mark in early October, dropping 7.1 per cent on Tuesday to close at US$55.69 a barrel.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To move crude to market, producers are turning to more expensive rail options – and even trucks – while some companies are cutting back production and essentially storing the oil underground until prices improve.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“KXL is a project that the industry needs and is a valuable piece of infrastructure for the North American economy," Mr. Miller said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The company executive said producers and refiners who want to move crude on the line remain on board, and that the pipeline is virtually 100-per-cent committed with long-term contracts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 1,900-kilometre pipeline would move 830,000 barrels a day of crude from Alberta to southern Nebraska, where it would connect with the system moving oil to the Gulf Coast refining hub.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Earlier in the session, TransCanada chief executive Russ Girling said the U.S. Gulf Coast remains the best market for Canadian oil sands producers, and Keystone XL would provide a low-cost transport to refineries that are specifically configured to process heavy crude. Assuming the project proceeds, the company is considering taking on a joint-venture partner to provide some equity financing and reduce <span class="companylink">TransCanada</span>'s need to take on debt.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">However, the company is still reviewing what needs to be done to address the deficiencies that the federal judge identified in striking down the permit, although the State Department will lead that process.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Analysts said last week that the legal setback could delay the project for a year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a ruling released last Thursday, U.S.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">District Court Judge Brian Morris wrote that the State Department analysis of the project failed to adequately assess the cumulative effects of greenhouse gas emissions and the impact on Native American land resources.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even without Keystone XL, <span class="companylink">TransCanada</span> would have enough capital projects to continue its growth trajectory, with about $28-billion worth of projects either under way or in late planning stages. They include expansion of Alberta's natural gas gathering system; major gas pipelines in Mexico; and the $6.2-billion Coastal Gaslink, which will connect the gas fields of northeastern B.C.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">with a liquefied natural gas terminal being built by LNG Canada, a consortium led by Royal Dutch Shell PLC. TransCanada is also participating in the $8-billion life extension for six reactors at Ontario's <span class="companylink">Bruce Power</span>, in which the company has a 48.5-per-cent stake, while the Ontario Municipal Retirement System owns 48.5 per cent, and employees and their unions have the remaining 3 per cent.</p>

But reaching the goal will require the co-operation of provinces and territories, which will have to agree to forgo resource revenues for the sake of preserving land and species. And the 17-per-cent target is just the beginning. Canada and the rest of the world are starting negotiations leading up to a meeting, two years from now, of the parties to the <span class="companylink">Convention on Biological Diversity</span> that will set new objectives for 2030 and beyond.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“There's been a very good discussion among a group of [world] leaders, leading environmentalists and conservationists, and also business leaders about the need to make this very practical and tangible, in the way that climate is," Ms. McKenna said in a telephone interview after the Victoria announcement.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nearly 200 countries around the world have agreed to a long-term goal of keeping the increase in global average temperature to less than two degrees Celsius above preindustrial levels.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even though the international convention on biodiversity has been in effect since 1993, the news around species at risk has not been good. The <span class="companylink">World Wildlife Fund</span> released a report in late October that said global wildlife populations have fallen by 60 per cent in the past four decades.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Here in Canada, recent research found that all caribou herds, including those that seemed sustainable 15 years ago, are on the path to extinction. And even when conservation measures are taken in sensitive regions, they do not guarantee that resource interests will stay away. Last week, the Canada-Newfoundland and Labrador Offshore Petroleum Board awarded new oil and gas leases within the Northeast Newfoundland Slope Conservation Area, an area that is supposed to be protected.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. McKenna is optimistic that efforts to slow the loss of biodiversity can be achieved through co-operation, and with the help of the federal commitment to invest $1.3-billion in conservation over the next five years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">James Snider, a vice-president of the World Wildlife Fund-Canada, says it is important to ensure not only that conservation targets are met, but that the right land is protected – that the territory that makes up the 17-percent goal is important to biodiversity and could come under threat. And “we've got to see the provinces and the territories also say that they are part of the solution here" leading up to the next round of international talks," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. McKenna will be in B.C. on Wednesday to announce that millions will be spent by Ottawa and the province to conserve the Next Creek watershed in the Darkwoods Conservation Area.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">VANCOUVER, British Columbia, Nov. 14, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- <span class="companylink">MGX Minerals Inc</span>. (“MGX” or the “Company”) ( / / ) and engineering subsidiary PurLucid Treatment Solutions Inc. (“PurLucid”) are pleased to announce they have received notice of publication of its patent for a new method to produce boiler feed water using low energy water treatment. The technology will facilitate using poor quality water to tri-generate electricity, pure water and minerals. The system was designed within a consortium, including MGX, PurLucid and David Bromley Engineering Ltd for the generation of electricity and excess steam for thermal oil recovery and extraction of lithium, vanadium and other minerals. The design, utilizing highly charged Replaceable Skin Layer (RSL™) membranes as a replacement for softening and ultrafiltration, substantively reduced cost and energy requirements while providing electricity for sale or internal use.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The patent filing outlines the proprietary method with example applications. When applied to heavy oil production in Alberta, the system can reduce the greenhouse gas emissions from 2.45 tpd/bbl capacity (0.48 tonnes / m3 of produced oil) to 1.19 tpd/bbl capacity (0.11 to 0.15 tonnes / m3 of produced oil). This reduces the energy requirement and associated GHG intensity by over 70%, making it similar to conventional oil recovery in other areas. In addition, because the capital used has revenue from both electricity and oil production, the cost of electricity production is comparable to the lower 25% of the market cost in North America and the cost of heavy oil production becomes similar to costs to produce light crude oil in the middle east.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MGX leads a consortium of power production, engineering and high-power demand clients evaluating opportunities for large-scale, low-cost power production.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rapid Lithium Brine Extraction TechnologyMGX has developed a rapid lithium extraction technology eliminating or greatly reducing the physical footprint and investment in large, multi-phase, lake sized, lined evaporation ponds, as well as enhancing the quality of extraction and recovery across a complex range of brines as compared with traditional solar evaporation. This technology is applicable to petrolithium (oil and gas wastewater), natural brine and other brine sources such as lithium-rich mine and industrial plant wastewater. The technology was recently chosen as winner of the Base and Specialty Metals Industry Leadership Award at the 2018 S&P Global Platts Global Metals Awards held in London in May (). The Company has also been selected as a finalist for the 2018 S&P Global Platts Global Energy Awards- Emerging Technology and Rising Star- to be held in New York City in December.

<span class="companylink">TransCanada Corp</span>. would consider all sources of funding to build its long-delayed Keystone XL pipeline, including a potential joint venture to reduce the risk of the project that was hit by another legal setback last week.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Should Keystone XL proceed, we will pursue an all-of-the-above funding model," Don Marchand, TransCanada executive vice-president and chief financial officer, told the company's investor day presentation in Toronto on Tuesday.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The company is considering using debt, hybrid securities and issuing shares to pay for the $10-billion pipeline between Alberta and the U.S.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Gulf Coast.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We would also consider JV partners - we're absolutely open-minded on that front as well," Marchand said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The CFO's comments come as <span class="companylink">TransCanada</span> works on "getting back to living within our means," and is taking a number of initiatives to reduce its debt burden.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Calgary-based pipeline giant was carrying $35 billion in longterm debt at the end of the third quarter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">TransCanada</span> currently has a $36-billion backlog of growth projects even without Keystone XL.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Realistically, they can't fund it all," said Jennifer Rowland, an analyst with Edward Jones in St. Louis. She said she expects other midstream companies - such as <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan Inc</span>. - apart from private equity players, who could be interested in partnering on the Keystone XL pipeline.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">However, the project will have to compete with the Ottawa-acquired Trans Mountain oil pipeline that would connect Alberta to the West Coast, which is also seeking investors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There is quite a bit of private equity money out there," Rowland said, adding there is a "high probability" private equity ends up playing a role if the company does pursue a joint venture.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Canaccord Genuity analyst David Galison argues that it makes sense for <span class="companylink">TransCanada</span> to look for joint-venture partners to fund Keystone XL.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"They've got a massive capital budget and interest rates have been rising," Galison said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, there is a sense of urgency in getting Keystone XL built, or nearly complete, before the next U.S. presidential election as the pipeline was rejected by former president Barack Obama before current President Donald Trump approved it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"With this project, there is an underlying level of risk in the U.S. if it's not in the ground and flowing by the time there's a new election in the U.S. at the executive level," Galison said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He said Obama had halted work on the Dakota Access Pipeline months before that project was completed and noted the same thing could conceivably happen to Keystone XL if Democrats retake the White House.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A federal court judge in Montana ordered <span class="companylink">TransCanada</span> to halt construction on the project until the <span class="companylink">U.S. State Department</span> has conducted detailed studies on potential spills and cumulative emissions impacts from oilsands pipelines.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We're going through the decision," said Paul Miller, TransCanada president, liquids pipelines, adding that the judge's demands were "manageable. However, at this point I believe it is too early to determine what impact it will have on our schedule."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He added the <span class="companylink">U.S. State Department</span> was "taking the lead" on the file.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Analysts, including at CIBC Capital Markets, have speculated the State Department will need to issue a supplemental environmental impact statement on the project, a process that could take six months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Miller declined to provide a new cost figure for the 830,000-bpd Keystone XL until all the legal challenges had been cleared.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There was a short window where people were hopeful (Keystone XL) was going to happen in 2019," Rowland said, adding that timeline seems difficult now.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's unfortunate for the Canadian producers more so than (<span class="companylink">TransCanada</span>)," she said, adding that the company has other projects it could pursue as it awaits a decision on its route through Nebraska and tries to address the deficiencies identified by the judge in Montana.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Canadian oil producers, meanwhile, are forced to accept record-setting discounts for heavy oil relative to the WTI benchmark, with the discount reaching to US$50 per barrel in October.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Miller called Keystone XL and the existing Keystone pipeline "two very effective bullet lines" that would allow <span class="companylink">TransCanada</span> to ship 1.4 million barrels of oil per day between Alberta and the U.S. Gulf Coast, which is a premium market for heavy oil.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For some time - decades, in fact - corporate governance gurus have been dragging Canadian business into an ideological swamp. Instead of simply pursuing profits for shareholders, it is now taken for granted that bankers, CEOs, directors, C-suite executives and institutional investors must champion corporations as centres of social and political agitprop. Profits may be a corporate objective, but only as part of a laundry list of subsidiary and subversive preoccupations and obligations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Corporate social responsibility (CSR), sustainable development, environmental and social corporate governance (ESG), impact investing, triple bottom line, social finance - no CEO in any major industry can deliver a speech without confirming his company's dedication to one or all of the above along with a host of other politically correct objectives.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Corporate websites are filled with CSR jargon that duplicates ENGO calls for political action. "Climate change is one of the most pressing issues of our time," the <span class="companylink">Royal Bank of Canada</span> declares in a "position statement" on climate change. The bank says "we" support the principles of the Paris Agreement.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But what if the pursuit of such non-profit objectives and political activity has the unintended consequence - at least on the part of the executives - of destroying the underlying foundations of corporations and the market economy they operate in? There may be no better demonstration of the potential dead-end risks of CSR and ESG than the current plight of Canada's energy sector.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a recent speech, the CEO of Husky Energy, Rob Peabody, described the oil bottleneck out of Alberta "the slowest train crash" he's ever seen. "From about 10 years out, you could see it coming, and yet we walked right into it as a nation."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More than a few corporations were on the train that produced the crash. But a specific example would be <span class="companylink">Royal Bank of Canada</span>. CEO Dave McKay recently told a Calgary audience Canadian oil needs better market access. "We need continue to be bold and push forward on energy infrastructure."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But McKay did not describe how Canada ended up without new pipelines. Nor did he refer to Prime Minister Trudeau's bold decision to kill the Northern Gateway pipeline to move Alberta oil to the West Coast through British Columbia's Great Bear Rainforest. Said Trudeau: "The Great Bear Rainforest is no place for a pipeline."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The rainforest should also be no place for bank CSR activities. But in 2008 RBC pledged $500,000 to the Tides Canada Foundation to help fund the Great Bear Rainforest protection racket. Tides, whose objective is to kill Alberta's oil sands, raised millions to close off 64,000 square kilometres of B.C. forest. In other words, RBC's corporate social responsibility - funded through its "Blue Water Project" - helped set up a rainforest that now serves as a barrier to getting Alberta oil to market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The cost of the rainforest barricade is in the billions of dollars in lost revenue. "If Northern Gateway had come on as planned, we wouldn't be in this situation," Tim McMillan, CEO of the Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers, said this week.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Banks and corporations cannot be solely blamed for Alberta's oil export crisis, but many played a role. The industry has its own share of CSR braggarts. Four that come to mind are <span class="companylink">Canadian Natural Resources</span>, Suncor, Cenovus and <span class="companylink">Shell Canada</span>. In 2014 they signed a deal with environmental groups and the Alberta government to limit oil sands carbon emissions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">RBC's social responsibility team was at it again last week.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As Peter Foster reported on this page last week, RBC was listed as a sponsor of "Indigenous Solutions for Environmental Challenges," a conference in Banff over the weekend to glorify the illegal activities of green activists in Ecuador and their Canadian and U.S. court campaign against <span class="companylink">Chevron</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An RBC spokesperson said in an email that the bank's sponsorship related to "sending a group of Indigenous youth to the conference who are interested in learning more about Indigenous approaches to land rights and conservation. It is part of our broader commitment to supporting youth in Canada by connecting them with learning and networking opportunities to help advance their careers." After Foster's report, however, RBC's logo was removed from the otherwise radical roster of sponsors. I wonder why? Corporate subservience to CSR and ESG is now an international phenomenon backed by an army of consultants, lawyers, activists, investor organizations and executives. ESG in particular has crept up the corporate hierarchy and is now endorsed by countless corporations, despite a lack of any evidence that ESG produces real benefits to shareholders or the economy. At best, the research is murky. One typical study of ESG in Europe concluded with a damp squib: "Overall, our evidence fosters the assumption that there is a business case to be made for corporate social responsibility." Take that to the bank.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The idea that CSR and ESG have no business in the boardrooms of the nation - and that such activity can undermine the economy - is not new. In 1970, Nobel economist Milton Friedman devastatingly detailed the many risks associated with CSR as a model. The short-sightedness of business executives, he said, is exemplified in their speeches on social responsibility. "This may gain them kudos in the short run. But it helps to strengthen the already too prevalent view that the pursuit of profits is wicked and immoral and must be curbed and controlled by external forces. Once this view is adopted, the external forces that curb the market will not be the social consciences, however highly developed, of the pontificating executives; it will be the iron fist of government bureaucrats."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Lubicon were missed in treaty negotiations in the late 1800s and fought for 40 years for a land settlement that would bring muchneeded housing, better education and health care.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dignitaries from the federal and Alberta government were in Little Buffalo on Tuesday as Chief Billy-Joe Laboucan signed off on the deal in front of smiling band members who packed the community's gym.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's only appropriate that we're here in Little Buffalo school because (what) we're doing here today impacts all of these students, all of the children that are going to school here, all of the children that have yet to be born," Laboucan said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Lubicon gained a global stage when they held a protest at the Calgary Olympics in 1988 and blockaded roads into the disputed area to draw attention to their plight. A <span class="companylink">UN</span> committee and <span class="companylink">Amnesty International</span> criticized Canada for its treatment of the First Nation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Laboucan said people still talk about past disputes and things that happened in the community. "That's over. It's time to move on and we have moved on," he said. "I thank the people of Lubicon for being able to do that."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After they were missed by British officials negotiating Treaty 8, the Lubicon spent decades in limbo, even after the federal government agreed in 1939 that they deserved title to their land.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The issue stagnated until the 1970s when oil and gas companies began carving through local traplines. By then, the Lubicon were so poor that diseases such as tuberculosis were a problem.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The deal includes about 245 square kilometres of land and $113 million to rebuild Little Buffalo.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Carolyn Bennett, federal minister of Crown-Indigenous relations, said no agreement can fully right the wrongs the Lubicon faced, but it is important to start making amends.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Some may say that this has been a long time coming. That would be a gross understatement," she said Tuesday. "This is not about patience. This is about the incredible persistence of your people to have your rights recognized and implemented."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Operating Results</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the third quarter we continued with our expanded 2018 drilling campaign by successfully drilling three wells, bringing the total to eight development wells drilled through September 30, 2018. Capital expenditures totaled $5,121,000, of which $4,543,000 related to drilling and development activities. We recompleted 12 wells in the quarter, with an aggregate 21 wells recompleted through September 30, 2018.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Third quarter 2018 crude oil production averaged 1,758 bbls/d, a 22% increase relative to the 1,437 bbls/d produced in the third quarter of 2017. Third quarter average daily production increased 2% from the second quarter of 2018, with growth slowed by weather based electrical supply disruptions and higher than normal crude oil inventory held at September 30, 2018.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The eight wells drilled in 2018 combined to add approximately 249 bbls/d of incremental production in the third quarter, despite two new wells beginning to produce in mid-August and one well initiating production at the end of September. The four wells drilled in 2017 continued to perform above internal expectations, contributing approximately 351 bbls/d of production in the quarter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Financial Results</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Our third quarter operating netback was $6,004,000 ($37.13 per barrel), an improvement of 86% compared to $3,234,000 ($24.46 per barrel) recorded in the third quarter of 2017. Higher realized prices and production resulted in a $5,005,000 increase in petroleum sales relative to the third quarter of 2017. This was offset by higher royalties of $1,390,000 from increased production and the sliding scale effect of increased commodity pricing to royalty rates. Operating costs increased by $845,000 from the prior year comparative quarter based on variable costs from increased production and increased well site security and monitoring costs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We generated funds flow from operations of $3,260,000 in the third quarter of 2018 versus $1,387,000 in the equivalent quarter of 2017. The increase in funds flow was largely attributed to stronger realized crude oil pricing and operating netback combined with a 22% increase in production. As a result, we generated net earnings of $267,000 in the quarter, compared to a net loss of $1,203,000 reported in the prior year comparative quarter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We maintained stable financial liquidity, exiting the quarter with positive working capital of $2,025,000 and a $15,000,000 principal term loan balance. Our September 30, 2018 net debt of $12,975,000 represented net debt to trailing twelve-month funds flow from operations of 1.3 times and net debt to third quarter 2018 annualized funds flow from operation of 1.0 times.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Operations</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Touchstone delivered October 2018 crude oil average sales volumes of 1,964 bbls/d at an average realized price of $89.13 (US$68.48) per barrel. After achieving field estimated peak production of 2,088 bbls/d buoyed by flush production from the new WD-8 completed in early October, production volumes decreased as the wells were converted from flowing to pumping production.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We spud the ninth well of our 2018 drilling program on November 1, 2018, and we expect the well to reach total depth within the next two days. The well is located on our WD-8 property and will be followed by the drilling of two additional wells in WD-8 from a common surface location. The Company has contracted a second third party rig to drill an additional WD-4 location, with spudding expected by the end of the month. Touchstone anticipates that the four wells will be drilled and completed by the end of the year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We previously planned on utilizing a separate rig to drill two shallow work commitment wells on our South Palo Seco property prior to the end of the year. However, <span class="companylink">Petrotrin</span> identified internal surface lease issues with the two previously approved locations. This will result in the Company drilling a total of 12 wells by year-end, with the two Palo Seco wells likely being pushed into the 2019 drilling program.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Petroleum Company of Trinidad and Tobago Limited (“<span class="companylink">Petrotrin</span>”) Restructuring</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On August 28, 2018, <span class="companylink">Petrotrin</span> announced its intention to discontinue refining operations and focus on upstream production and exploration activities. This restructuring is expected to be completed prior to the end of the year. The Company subleases various petroleum production and exploration rights from <span class="companylink">Petrotrin</span> and the national oil company is currently the Company’s sole purchaser of crude oil.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Company has been officially informed that <span class="companylink">Petrotrin</span> will continue to meet its contractual operations and commitments throughout the transition process. <span class="companylink">Petrotrin</span> has indicated that it will be meeting with all pertinent stakeholders following completion of the restructuring to discuss future changes and opportunities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We do not expect the restructuring to impact our current crude oil production and marketing arrangements and future operations. We believe our crude oil will continue to be purchased by <span class="companylink">Petrotrin</span> and consolidated with all Trinidad production for export. Touchstone is looking forward to working with the restructured national oil company to grow crude oil production in Trinidad.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">About Touchstone</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Advisories</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Non-GAAP Measures</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This news release contains terms commonly used in the oil and natural gas industry, including funds flow from operations per share, operating netback and net debt. These terms do not have a standardized meaning under International Financial Reporting Standards and may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other companies. Shareholders and investors are cautioned that these measures should not be construed as alternatives to cash provided by operating activities, net income, total liabilities, or other measures of financial performance as determined in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. Management uses these Non-GAAP measures for its own performance measurement and to provide stakeholders with measures to compare the Company’s operations over time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Company calculates funds flow from operations per share by dividing funds flow from operations by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the applicable period.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Company uses operating netback as a key performance indicator of field results. Operating netback is presented on an absolute and per barrel basis and is calculated by deducting royalties and operating expenses from petroleum sales. If applicable, the Company also discloses operating netback both prior to realized gains or losses on derivatives and after the impacts of derivatives are included. Realized gains or losses represent the portion of risk management contracts that have settled in cash during the period, and disclosing this impact provides Management and investors with transparent measures that reflect how the Company’s risk management program can impact netback metrics. The Company considers operating netback to be a key measure as it demonstrates Touchstone’s profitability relative to current commodity prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Company closely monitors its capital structure with a goal of maintaining a strong financial position in order to fund current operations and the future growth of the Company. The Company monitors working capital and net debt as part of its capital structure to assess its true debt and liquidity position and to manage capital and liquidity risk. Net debt is calculated by summing the Company’s working capital and the principal (undiscounted) amount of long-term debt. Working capital is calculated as current assets less current liabilities as they appear on the statements of financial position.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Forward-Looking Statements</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Certain information provided in this news release may constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of applicable securities laws. Forward-looking information in this news release may include, but is not limited to, statements relating to field estimated production, <span class="companylink">Petrotrin</span>’s restructuring plans, timing thereof, and the effect on the Company’s operating and marketing agreements and future operations, the potential undertaking, timing, locations and costs of future well drilling and completion activities, and the sufficiency of resources to fund future well drilling operations. Although the Company believes that the expectations and assumptions on which the forward-looking statements are based are reasonable, undue reliance should not be placed on the forward-looking statements because the Company can give no assurance that they will prove to be correct.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS FOR THE QUARTER ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2018</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">Delphi</span>’s continued success in the development of its liquids-rich Montney play, cost reduction initiatives and the Company’s ability to generate marketing income through its excess firm transportation on the Alliance pipeline system have contributed to significant growth in the Company’s adjusted funds flow of 53 percent and 67 percent for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018 over the respective comparative periods in 2017. <span class="companylink">Delphi</span>’s operating netback before risk management in the third quarter was $23.01 per boe while the corresponding cash netback was $17.46 per boe, compared to $11.52 per boe and $6.55 per boe in the comparative period in 2017.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">Delphi</span> was active in the field drilling four (2.60 net) wells, two (1.30 net) of which were brought on production in the last few days of September. Although these wells had little impact on quarterly production of 9,514 boe/d, they will contribute to expected strong production results in the fourth quarter. Production volumes in the third quarter were negatively impacted by approximately 800 boe/d due to unscheduled third party processing plant outages.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Field condensate production was 2,196 bbls/d, accounting for 23 percent of production on a boe basis and 51 percent of crude oil and natural gas revenues. Total field condensate and natural gas liquids production accounted for 37 percent of production on a boe basis while contributing 72 percent of crude oil and natural gas revenues. In comparison, in the third quarter of 2017, total field condensate and natural gas liquids production accounted for 36 percent of production on a boe basis while contributing 54 percent of crude oil and natural gas revenues.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Operating, transportation and general and administrative costs combined are $3.2 million or 21 percent lower than in the the second quarter of 2018, and $3.0 million or 20 percent less than in the third quarter of 2017. Lower operating and transportation costs are partially due to the commissioning of the amine facility and the corresponding shift of volumes onto the NGTL system.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">Delphi</span> shipped approximately 60 percent of its natural gas into the Chicago market and the remainder was sold in Alberta through the NGTL pipeline system. <span class="companylink">Delphi</span>’s realized natural gas price, before risk management and including marketing income, was $3.06 per mcf, more than double the average AECO benchmark price of $1.19 per mcf. While the shift of volumes from the Chicago market to the AECO market in the third quarter had the impact of reducing the average realized price of our natural gas, it was more than offset by savings in operating and transportation costs and increased marketing income generated from the additional excess Alliance firm transportation. The proportion of natural gas sold in the Chicago market is expected to return to 90 percent once the Alliance lateral pipeline to the Bigstone West gas plant is reactivated which is expected to occur in 2019.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Net debt which includes bank debt, working capital deficiency, senior secured notes, and the unused take-or-pay contract liability at the end of the quarter was $163.4 million. <span class="companylink">Delphi</span> has significant financial liquidity having only $55 million currently drawn on its $105 million senior credit facility.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NATURAL GAS MARKETING DELIVERING PREMIUM PRICING</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">Delphi</span> has a total of 57 mmcf/d of firm and priority interruptible service on the Alliance pipeline system and 24 mmcf/d of firm service on the NGTL pipeline system. All of <span class="companylink">Delphi</span>’s natural gas hedges are focused on the more robust Chicago delivery point. <span class="companylink">Delphi</span> continues to generate marketing income from the excess service it holds on Alliance through a combination of temporary assignment to other shippers at a premium over cost or through the purchase of natural gas in Alberta or British Columbia for sale in Chicago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">COMMODITY RISK MANAGEMENT PROGRAM STABILIZING REALIZED PRICES</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Company has continued its active forward-looking hedging strategy, locking in strong natural gas and WTI pricing into 2019 and 2020. The recent widening of condensate price differentials is generally viewed as a short term issue with differentials normalizing into the second half of 2019.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">Delphi</span>’s realized prices for condensate and NGLs are well protected by WTI crude oil hedges, equal to approximately 85 percent of its liquids production, at an average price of C$85.73 per bbl for calendar year 2019 compared to the current strip price of approximately C$73.90 per bbl.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WEST BIGSTONE OPERATIONS CONTINUE TO DELIVER SUPERIOR WELL RESULTS</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The delineation success at West Bigstone combined with the anticipated benefits of multi-well pad development are the fundamental drivers behind <span class="companylink">Delphi</span>’s decision to accelerate 2019 capital spending into the fourth quarter of 2018. While pad development extends the cycle time from spud to first production, the modest impact of the delay is significantly outweighed by the estimated well cost savings and productivity gains expected.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">Delphi</span> has finished drilling the first horizontal Montney well on its inaugural four-well pad at 02/15-10-60-24W5 (“02/15-10”) in West Bigstone. Because of operational efficiencies gained through pad development, particularly through the completion of the wells, the Company has installed a hybrid completion liner at 02/15-10 allowing for 80 discrete fracs in the horizontal. Multi-well pad operations allow for a frac program of this scale as it would otherwise be cost prohibitive on a single well pad. The 80 stage completion will be almost 25 percent more stages than <span class="companylink">Delphi</span> has pumped to date in a single well. The 16-10-60-24W5 (“16-10”) well that came on production in May of 2018, and was a key success leading to pad development at West Bigstone, was completed with 65 stages. Through further frac design innovations and efficiencies inherent in pad operations, the planned 80 stage frac is expected to cost approximately 20 percent less than the 65 stage completion at 16-10. Over the first five months on production, 16-10 has produced 0.6 bcf of raw natural gas and 76,000 bbls of 49 degree API field condensate. The immediate offset to 16-10 at 00/15-10-60-24W5 (“00/15-10”) that tested at similar field condensate rates to the 16-10, has recently been brought on production through the Company’s 100 percent owned Negus processing facility.</p>

<span class="companylink">Delphi</span> projects that over a three-year period (2019 to 2021) in a scenario where capital spending equates to adjusted funds flow, production would increase by approximately 30 percent and net debt to trailing adjusted funds flow will be reduced to below 2.0 times. In this scenario, <span class="companylink">Delphi</span> would expect to outspend adjusted funds flow in 2019 and underspend in 2020 and 2021, while drilling 37 wells. With a significant inventory of drilling locations on 128 undeveloped sections of land, <span class="companylink">Delphi</span> has the potential to considerably increase production and adjusted funds flow from the Bigstone property. It is expected that the Company’s adjusted funds flow growth will continue to outpace overall production growth, as a result of the increasing percentage of condensate and focus on cash cost reductions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Condensate differentials, which historically have had low volatility, expanded along with differentials for Canadian heavy and light crude oils commencing in September. This was due to a number of factors including a longer than expected shutdown of the Strathcona refinery in Edmonton and seasonal refinery turnarounds in the U.S. Midwest resulting in the filling of storage in Edmonton and the apportionment of crude export pipelines, as well as feeder pipelines bringing crude and condensate to Edmonton. Apportionment of feeder pipelines bringing condensate to Edmonton will continue until storage levels are reduced to normal levels which is expected to take a number of months. While we anticipate that <span class="companylink">Delphi</span> will be able to sell all its condensate production throughout the period of apportionment, the Company will be impacted by the higher condensate differentials, particularly as the apportioned volumes will be sold on the spot market where we expect higher differentials than for monthly sales. The fundamentals for condensate remain strong, with more than half of demand continuing to be met by higher cost condensate being imported by pipelines and rail. It is still the most under-supplied and highest value commodity <span class="companylink">Delphi</span> and the industry produces.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Given the Company’s reconfirmed borrowing base of its $105 million senior secured credit facility with only $55 million drawn and its significant in-the-money hedge position on both WTI and Chicago natural gas prices, <span class="companylink">Delphi</span> remains well positioned to execute its planned capital program on its liquids-rich Montney asset at Bigstone while maintaining financial flexibility.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">Delphi</span>’s guidance for production in the fourth quarter of 2018 remains unchanged with the transition to pad drilling. Net debt to adjusted funds flow is projected to increase during the drilling and completion of the four-well pad at West Bigstone but by the second quarter of 2019, as production volumes from the pad materialize, leverage metrics are expected to be reduced below current levels.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">Delphi</span> intends to release its 2019 drilling plans and guidance in the first quarter of 2019.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More particularly and without limitation, this release contains forward-looking statements and information relating to petroleum and natural gas production estimates and weighting, projected crude oil and natural gas prices, future exchange rates, expectations as to royalty rates, expectations as to transportation and operating costs, expectations as to general and administrative costs and interest expense, expectations as to capital expenditures and net debt, planned capital spending, future liquidity and <span class="companylink">Delphi</span>’s ability to fund ongoing capital requirements through operating cash flows and its credit facilities, supply and demand fundamentals for oil and gas commodities, timing and success of development and exploitation activities, cash availability for the financing of capital expenditures, access to third-party infrastructure, treatment under governmental regulatory regimes and tax laws and future environmental regulations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Furthermore, statements relating to “reserves” are deemed to be forward-looking statements as they involve the implied assessment, based on certain estimates and assumptions that the reserves described can be profitable in the future.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The forward-looking statements and information contained in this release are based on certain key expectations and assumptions made by <span class="companylink">Delphi</span>. The following are certain material assumptions on which the forward-looking statements and information contained in this release are based: the stability of the global and national economic environment, the stability of and commercial acceptability of tax, royalty and regulatory regimes applicable to <span class="companylink">Delphi</span>, exploitation and development activities being consistent with management’s expectations, production levels of <span class="companylink">Delphi</span> being consistent with management’s expectations, the absence of significant project delays, the stability of oil and gas prices, the absence of significant fluctuations in foreign exchange rates and interest rates, the stability of costs of oil and gas development and production in Western Canada, including operating costs, the timing and size of development plans and capital expenditures, availability of third party infrastructure for transportation, processing or marketing of oil and natural gas volumes, prices and availability of oilfield services and equipment being consistent with management’s expectations, the availability of, and competition for, among other things, pipeline capacity, skilled personnel and drilling and related services and equipment, results of development and exploitation activities that are consistent with management’s expectations, weather affecting <span class="companylink">Delphi</span>’s ability to develop and produce as expected, contracted parties providing goods and services on the agreed timeframes, <span class="companylink">Delphi</span>’s ability to manage environmental risks and hazards and the cost of complying with environmental regulations, the accuracy of operating cost estimates, the accurate estimation of oil and gas reserves, future exploitation, development and production results and <span class="companylink">Delphi</span>’s ability to market oil and natural gas successfully to current and new customers. Additionally, estimates as to expected average annual production rates assume that no unexpected outages occur in the infrastructure that the Company relies on to produce its wells, that existing wells continue to meet production expectations and any future wells scheduled to come on in the coming year meet timing and production expectations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Commodity prices used in the determination of forecast revenues are based upon general economic conditions, commodity supply and demand forecasts and publicly available price forecasts. The Company continually monitors its forecast assumptions to ensure the stakeholders are informed of material variances from previously communicated expectations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Financial outlook information contained in this release about prospective results of operations, financial position or cash flows is based on assumptions about future events, including economic conditions and proposed courses of action, based on management’s assessment of the relevant information currently available. Readers are cautioned that such financial outlook information contained in this release should not be used for purposes other than for which it is disclosed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although the Company believes that the expectations reflected in such forward-looking statements and information are reasonable, it can give no assurance that such expectations will prove to be correct and such forward-looking statements should not be unduly relied upon. Since forward-looking statements and information address future events and conditions, by their very nature they involve inherent known and unknown risks and uncertainties. <span class="companylink">Delphi</span>’s actual results, performance or achievements could differ materially from those expressed in, or implied by, these forward-looking statements and, accordingly, no assurance can be given that any of the events anticipated by the forward-looking statements will transpire or occur, or if any of them do so, what benefits <span class="companylink">Delphi</span> will derive therefrom. Should one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize, or should assumptions underlying forward-looking statements prove incorrect, actual results may vary materially from those currently anticipated due to a number of factors and risks. These include, but are not limited to, the risks associated with the oil and gas industry in general such as operational risks in development, exploration and production, delays or changes in plans with respect to exploration or development projects or capital expenditures, the uncertainty of estimates and projections relating to production rates, costs and expenses, commodity price and exchange rate fluctuations, marketing and transportation, environmental risks, competition from others for scarce resources, the ability to access sufficient capital from internal and external sources, changes in governmental regulation of the oil and gas industry and changes in tax, royalty and environmental legislation. Additional information on these and other factors that could affect the Company’s operations or financial results are included in the Company’s most recent Annual Information Form and other reports on file with the applicable securities regulatory authorities and may be accessed through the SEDAR website ().</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Readers are cautioned that the foregoing list of factors is not exhaustive.

The forward-looking statements contained in this release are expressly qualified in their entirety by this cautionary statement.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Basis of Presentation. For the purpose of reporting production information, reserves and calculating unit prices and costs, natural gas volumes have been converted to a barrel of oil equivalent (boe) using six thousand cubic feet equal to one barrel. A boe conversion ratio of 6:1 is based upon an energy equivalency conversion method primarily applicable at the burner tip and does not represent a value equivalency at the wellhead. This conversion conforms to the Canadian Securities Administrators’ National Instrument 51-101 when boes are disclosed. Boes may be misleading, particularly if used in isolation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As per CSA Staff Notice 51-327 initial test results and initial production performance should be considered preliminary data and such data is not necessarily indicative of long-term performance or of ultimate recovery. “IP” is an abbreviation for “Initial Production” and represents average production rates over the indicated time period in producing days.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Non-GAAP Measures. The release contains the terms “adjusted funds flow”, “adjusted funds flow per share”, “net debt”, “net debt to adjusted funds flow ratio”, “marketing income”, “operating netbacks”, “cash netbacks,” and “netbacks” which are not recognized measures under GAAP. The Company uses these measures to help evaluate its performance. Management considers netbacks an important measure as it demonstrates its profitability relative to current commodity prices and costs of production.Management uses adjusted funds flow to analyze performance and considers it a key measure as it demonstrates the Company’s ability to generate the cash necessary to fund future capital investments, abandonment obligations and to repay debt. Adjusted funds flow is a non-GAAP measure and has been defined by the Company as cash flow from operating activities before decommissioning expenditures and changes in non-cash working capital from operating activities. The Company also presents adjusted funds flow per share whereby amounts per share are calculated using weighted average shares outstanding consistent with the calculation of earnings per share. <span class="companylink">Delphi</span>’s determination of adjusted funds flow may not be comparable to that reported by other companies nor should it be viewed as an alternative to cash flow from operating activities, net earnings or other measures of financial performance calculated in accordance with GAAP. The Company has defined net debt as the sum of bank debt, senior secured notes and the long term portion of unutilized take-or-pay contract plus/minus working capital deficit/surplus excluding the current portion of the fair value of financial instruments. Net debt is used by management to monitor remaining availability under its credit facilities. Marketing income is defined as the margin earned on the sale of purchased third party natural gas volumes and premiums received on the assignment of a portion of committed capacity on the Alliance pipeline system to a third party. Management considers marketing income important measures of the Company’s ability to mitigate the cost of excess committed capacity. Operating netbacks have been defined as revenue plus marketing income less royalties, transportation and operating costs. Cash netbacks have been defined as operating netbacks less interest on bank debt and senior secured notes, general and administrative costs and cash costs related to the Company’s restricted share units. Netbacks are generally discussed and presented on a per boe basis.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">2018 THIRD QUARTER HIGHLIGHTS</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">* Production increased by 35% on a per-share basis from the prior year to a record 20,455 Boe per day which was consistent with guidance (19,500 to 20,500 Boe per day).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">* Liquids production (field condensate plus gas plant NGL) grew by 24% year over year with liquids representing 17% of total production and 41% of production revenue. Condensate increased by 29% while NGL increased by 17% as a result of lower NGL recoveries at the McMahon Gas Plant.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">* Growth over the last 12 months has been achieved while investing less than funds flow (debt reduced by $17 million).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">* At the end of the quarter, there was an inventory of six Montney horizontal wells (5.5 net) at Umbach that had not started producing which included four completed wells. One horizontal well (1.0 net) started production at the end of the quarter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">* As a result of the continuing improvement in horizontal well performance at Umbach, the internal type curve used by management to forecast production from new wells is being increased to 11 Bcf raw from 9 Bcf raw which is based on the performance of wells completed in 2017 and 2018 that have higher rates and shallower declines than previously forecast.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">* At the Nig land block, three wells completed in 2018 are exceeding expectations and have averaged 8.2 Mmcf per day raw gas over the first 120 calendar days plus 225 barrels per day of field condensate (average of 1,600 Boe per day sales with 23% liquids including NGL recovered at the gas plant). The field condensate-gas ratio is approximately 50% higher than the average well at Umbach.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">* Diversified sales resulted in the natural gas price net of transportation being $2.13 per Mcf which was materially higher than Western Canadian pricing (AECO was $1.13 per GJ while Station 2 was $1.24 per GJ).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">* Production costs, cash G&A and interest expense on a per-Boe basis declined by 11% year over year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">* Funds flow was $22.2 million, or $0.18 per share, a 64% increase on a per-share basis from last year which was largely from higher production volumes and higher liquids prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">* Net income for the year to date is $13.3 million or $0.11 per share which is a decrease from $31.1 million last year as a result of non-cash unrealized gains or losses on hedging which reduced the year to date by $18.1 million while adding $25.4 million in the previous year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">* Capital investment was $21.8 million which included five horizontal well completions, installing additional compression at Umbach and twinning part of a field gathering pipeline to Nig.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">* The balance sheet remains strong with debt including the working capital deficiency being $84.6 million which represents 1.0 times annualized quarterly funds flow and 47% of the bank credit facility ($180 million).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">* Commodity price hedges continue to be added and currently protect approximately 42% of forecast production for 2019. OPERATIONS REVIEW</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Umbach, Nig and Fireweed Areas, Northeast British Columbia</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Storm's land position at Umbach is prospective for liquids-rich natural gas from the Montney formation and currently totals 113,000 net acres (161 net sections). During the third quarter, two sections of land were acquired.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Third quarter field activity included completing five horizontal wells (5.0 net), adding compression and twinning part of a gathering pipeline to Nig that will reduce wellhead flowing pressure and increase capacity. One horizontal well started production on September 19th and there remains an inventory of six horizontal wells (5.5 net) that had not started producing at the end of the quarter which includes four completed wells.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fourth quarter field activity is expected to include drilling five wells (5.0 net) and completing three wells (2.5 net) which includes the standing well (0.5 net) at Fireweed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The drilling program for this winter and into 2019 will generally target areas where higher field condensate-gas ratios are expected. In the fourth quarter of 2018, two wells (2.0 net) will be drilled at Umbach and three wells (3.0 net) at Nig. During 2019, four wells (4.0 net) will be drilled at Nig including an acid gas disposal well and three wells (1.5 net) at Fireweed. One of the wells at Nig will be drilled into the lower Montney.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At Umbach, approximately $115 million has been invested since 2013 to build infrastructure (pipelines and facilities) with current field compression capacity totaling 150 Mmcf per day raw gas after additional compression was installed at the end of the third quarter. Throughput in the third quarter averaged 107 Mmcf per day raw gas. Current compression capacity supports growth in corporate production to approximately 27,000 Boe per day with growth dependent on the Station 2 price (incremental natural gas production would be directed to Station 2). Produced raw natural gas is sour (approximately 1.2% H2S) with approximately 85% directed to the McMahon Gas Plant and 15% directed to the Stoddart Gas Plant. Firm processing commitments are 65 Mmcf raw gas per day at McMahon (5 to 15 year terms) and 15 Mmcf per day at Stoddart (1 year term).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At Nig, the regulatory application for the planned 50 Mmcf per day gas plant (100% working interest) was submitted in mid-September. Depending on when approval is received, site preparation would occur in the first half of 2019, construction in the second half of 2019, and start-up is anticipated to be between the fourth quarter of 2019 and the first quarter of 2020. The main benefits from the gas plant are a forecast operating cost of $2.00 per Boe (reduces the corporate operating cost to approximately $4.25 per Boe) and incremental production totaling approximately 1,500 Boe per day which comes from improved liquids recovery (adds 1,100 barrels per day with 90% NGL) plus a 5% reduction in process shrinkage. The total cost of the project is estimated to be $81 million which includes $73 million for the gas plant, $4 million for an acid gas injection well and $4 million for a sales pipeline. During the third quarter, $2.5 million was invested primarily for equipment deposits and, in the fourth quarter, $11 million is expected to be invested for equipment deposits.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At Fireweed, engineering and design is underway for the planned 50 Mmcf per day field compression facility (50% working interest). The expected cost of the facility is $34 million gross and it is designed to be expandable to 100 Mmcf per day. Depending on when regulatory approvals are received, construction is expected to start later in 2019 or early in 2020 with start-up in the second half of 2020. Based on the production history from offsetting horizontal wells, field condensate-gas ratios are expected to be approximately 25 barrels per Mmcf higher than Umbach over the life of a well and up to 60 barrels per Mmcf higher in the first year. The first phase of development will include drilling and completing up to 12 horizontal wells (6.0 net) which are expected to add 4,000 to 5,000 Boe per day on a net basis (25% liquids) once the facility is completed in the second half of 2020.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Initial flow results after completing the standing well (0.5 net) at Fireweed are encouraging. The well is located at C-74-G/94-A-13, has a completed length of 1,420 metres and was completed using the ball drop hydraulic fracturing method with 2,300 tonnes of proppant pumped into 35 stages using slick-water. After flowing the frac fluid back on a six-day cleanup, the flow rate averaged 10.9 Mmcf per day raw gas plus 660 barrels per day of 54 degree field condensate and 1,140 barrels per day of frac water over the last 12 hours while flowing up the casing with a final flowing pressure of 4,800 kPa. The well was shut in after recovering 23% of the frac water and is expected to remain shut in until the Fireweed field compression facility is completed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Initial rates from the wells completed in 2018 (all on the Nig land block) have been very strong with no decline to date. Rates over the first 120 calendar days have averaged 8.2 Mmcf per day raw gas plus 225 barrels per day of field condensate (average 1,600 Boe per day sales with 23% liquids including NGL recovered at the gas plant). The field condensate-gas ratio is 50% higher than the average well at Umbach. Current rates are averaging approximately 8.0 Mmcf per day plus 150 barrels per day of field condensate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Given the improvement in rates that has been realized from longer horizontal wells, Storm management is now using an 11 Bcf raw gas type curve (internal estimate) to forecast production from new wells. Previously, management used a 9 Bcf raw gas type curve (internal estimate). The revised type curve is based on the performance of the wells completed in 2017 which have a shallower decline than previously forecast. Future wells will be materially longer (2,400 metres) and have more frac stages (40 to 46) than the 2017 wells. A summary of horizontal well results is provided below with more information on well performance and management’s type curve being available in the presentation on Storm’s website.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Commodity price hedges are used to support longer-term growth by continually layering in hedges to protect pricing on 50% of current production for the next 12 months and 25% for 13 to 24 months forward. Anticipated production growth is not hedged. Note that approximately 80% of Storm’s liquids production is priced in reference to WTI. The current hedge position protects approximately 58% of forecast production for the fourth quarter of 2018 and 42% for 2019.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For the fourth quarter of 2018, production is forecast to be 19,000 to 21,000 Boe per day with production to date averaging 19,300 Boe per day based on field estimates which includes three days with no production due to outages at the McMahon Gas Plant and the Enbridge T-south pipeline failure on October 9th. The effect of the pipeline failure on the Station 2 price is uncertain at this time due to varying restrictions on flow rates for repairs as well as the timing for storage withdrawals from the Aitken Creek storage facility (some production will be shut in as receipts and deliveries at Station 2 must be equal). To date in the fourth quarter, the Station 2 price has averaged $0.72 per GJ which has resulted in Storm’s production being restricted to minimize sales at Station 2. The lower Station 2 price is not expected to have a material effect on Storm’s fourth quarter financial results since it is largely mitigated by diversified natural gas sales (less than 15% of sales are at Station 2), existing hedges at Station 2 (5.6 Mmcf per day), unhedged volumes sold at a much higher Sumas price (2.3 Mmcf per day), and the ability to divert some production onto the <span class="companylink">Alliance Pipeline</span> to the higher priced Chicago market (up to 14 Mmcf per day).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Updated guidance for 2018 is provided below. Capital investment is increasing to $85 million (was $80 million) as the completion of a standing horizontal well at Fireweed was advanced into 2018 from 2019 and the estimated drilling and completion cost for a horizontal well was increased to $5.8 million (was $5.0 million) to reflect increased length with more frac stages (2,400 metres with 40 to 46 frac stages). With the increased length and frac stages, the type curve used by Storm management to forecast production from new wells has been increased to 11 Bcf raw gas (was 9 Bcf raw gas). This is supported by the performance to date of the wells completed in 2017 and 2018. Fourth quarter capital investment is expected to be $37 million which includes $11 million for the Nig Gas Plant. Forecast commodity prices reflect pricing to date and the approximate forward strip for the remainder of the year. Notably, the mid-point of forecast annual funds flow is approximately 15% higher than initial guidance provided in November 2017.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Guidance for 2019 is summarized below and includes capital investment of $128 million which includes $68 million for the sour gas plant at Nig and $14 million at Fireweed. Approximately 40% of capital investment will be in the first half of 2019. Drilling plans include five horizontal wells (5.0 net) at Nig including an acid gas disposal well, and three wells (1.5 net) at Fireweed. The estimated cost to drill and complete a horizontal well is $5.8 million for 2,400 metres of length with 40 to 46 frac stages. Capital investment is supported by commodity price hedges which protect approximately 42% of forecast production. The production forecast assumes an 11 Bcf raw gas type curve (internal estimate) for new horizontal wells. If required, capital investment and production growth can be reduced to ensure total debt is maintained at an appropriate level.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">* Based on mid-point field operating netback of $11.05 per Boe. For the nine months to date in 2018, financial results have improved materially when compared to last year which has further strengthened Storm’s balance sheet. Funds flow is up 62% year over year as a result of 29% production growth with diversified natural gas sales mitigating the decline in Western Canadian natural gas prices (decline of 36% at AECO and 24% at Station 2) and growing liquids production benefitting from the 35% increase in the WTI price. In addition, the significant improvement in horizontal well results has reduced capital investment required to grow production. As a result, total debt has decreased by $17 million over the last 12 months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Storm’s improving financial position will be used to self-fund planned growth from Nig (2019 – 2020), Fireweed (2020) and Umbach (contingent on the Station 2 price). This includes a large capital investment to expand infrastructure by constructing a sour gas plant at Nig and constructing a new field compression facility at Fireweed. The upfront investment in infrastructure is large but will provide a significant long-term benefit. Production is expected to increase to 25,000 Boe per day by the end of 2019 and to 30,000 Boe per day by the end of 2020 while increasing liquids as a proportion of total production and reducing operating costs which reduces exposure to current low Western Canadian natural gas prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With a large, multi-year drilling inventory in the Montney in an area that is liquids-rich and higher quality, Storm is well positioned to continue growing asset value per share over the next three years by advancing development at both Nig and Fireweed.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Boe Presentation- For the purpose of calculating unit revenues and costs, natural gas is converted to a barrel of oil equivalent (“Boe”) using six thousand cubic feet (“Mcf”) of natural gas equal to one barrel of oil unless otherwise stated. Boe may be misleading, particularly if used in isolation. A Boe conversion ratio of six Mcf to one barrel (“Bbl”) is based on an energy equivalency conversion method primarily applicable at the burner tip and does not represent a value equivalency at the wellhead. All Boe measurements and conversions in this report are derived by converting natural gas to oil in the ratio of six thousand cubic feet of gas to one barrel of oil. Mboe means 1,000 Boe.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Non-GAAP Measures - This document may refer to the terms “debt including working capital deficiency”, “field operating netbacks”, “field operating netbacks including hedging”, the terms “cash” and “non-cash”, “cash costs”, and measurements “per commodity unit” and “per Boe” which are not recognized under Generally Accepted Accounting Principles ("GAAP") and are regarded as non-GAAP measures. These non-GAAP measures may not be comparable to the calculation of similar amounts for other entities and readers are cautioned that use of such measures to compare enterprises may not be valid. Non-GAAP terms are used to benchmark operations against prior periods and peer group companies and are widely used by investors, analysts and other parties. Additional information relating to certain of these non-GAAP measures can be found in Storm’s MD&A dated November 13, 2018 for the period ended September 30, 2018 which is available on Storm’s SEDAR profile at www.sedar.com[http://www.sedar.com] and on Storm’s website at www.stormresourcesltd.com[http://www.stormresourcesltd.com].</p>

Statements of “reserves” are also deemed to be forward-looking statements, as they involve the implied assessment, based on certain estimates and assumptions, that the reserves described exist in the quantities predicted or estimated and that the reserves can be profitably produced in the future.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The forward-looking statements and information in this press release are based on certain key expectations and assumptions made by Storm, including: prevailing commodity prices and exchange rates; applicable royalty rates and tax laws; future well production rates; reserve and resource volumes; the performance of existing wells; success to be expected in drilling new wells; the adequacy of budgeted capital expenditures to carrying out planned activities; the availability and cost of services; and the receipt, in a timely manner, of regulatory and other required approvals. Although the Company believes that the expectations and assumptions on which such forward-looking statements and information are based are reasonable, undue reliance should not be placed on these forward-looking statements and information because of their inherent uncertainty. In particular, there is no assurance that exploitation of the Company’s undeveloped lands and prospects will result in the emergence of profitable operations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since forward-looking statements and information address future events and conditions, by their very nature they involve inherent risks and uncertainties.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CALGARY, Alberta, Nov. 13, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- <span class="companylink">Prairie Provident Resources Inc</span>. ("Prairie Provident" or the "Company") (TSX:PPR) is pleased to confirm that, in connection with its previously-announced acquisition of <span class="companylink">Marquee Energy Ltd</span>. ("Marquee"), the Company elected to obtain requisite approval of the Prairie Provident shareholders by written consent. The acquisition is proposed to be completed by way of statutory plan of arrangement under section 193 of the Business Corporations Act (Alberta) (the "Arrangement"), implementation of which will result in the Company acquiring all of the outstanding Marquee shares and the Marquee shareholders receiving, in exchange, 0.0886 common share of the Company for each Marquee share held.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Subject to requisite approvals by the Marquee shareholders at a special meeting to be held on November 19, 2018 and from the Court of Queen's Bench of Alberta, and to satisfaction or waiver of other conditions precedent as provided in the Arrangement Agreement between Prairie Provident and Marquee dated September 13, 2018, the Arrangement is expected to close on or about November 21, 2018.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Arrangement, as well as certain ancillary transactions involving the issue or potential issue of Prairie Provident common shares ("PPR Shares") as previously announced by the Company and more particularly described below, are also subject to acceptance by the Toronto Stock Exchange ("TSX"). Pursuant to TSX rules, because the total number of Prairie Provident shares potentially issuable under the Arrangement and such other transactions exceeds 25% of the number of PPR Shares currently outstanding (on a non-diluted basis) the TSX requires as, a condition to its acceptance, that the Company's shareholders shall have approved the issuance of PPR Shares thereunder.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Support agreements in respect of the Arrangement were previously entered into with holders of more than 50% of the total number of PPR Shares outstanding (on a non-diluted basis) having effective voting rights. In this regard, of the 119,514,260 PPR Shares currently outstanding, 14,791,375 are held by <span class="companylink">Goldman, Sachs & Co</span>., which elected to irrevocably waive any voting entitlement it may have in the PPR Shares owned or controlled by it. Excluding such PPR Shares, there are 104,722,885 PPR Shares outstanding (on a non-diluted basis) having effective voting rights. Accordingly, for shareholder approval purposes the Company has elected to obtain written consent of the supporting shareholders in lieu of incurring the expense of a formal meeting of shareholders.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The disclosure in this news release responds to regulatory requirements applicable where an issuer elects to obtain shareholder approval by written consent in lieu of a shareholders' meeting.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Based on the number of Marquee shares currently outstanding and the share exchange ratio under the Arrangement, up to 38,610,000 PPR Shares will be issued pursuant to the Arrangement. If all outstanding Marquee warrants and stock options are duly exercised (which would include full payment of the exercise price therefor) before completion of the Arrangement, up to an additional 5,490,000 PPR Shares could be issued such that, in aggregate, and as further supplemented by approximately 1% to accommodate the effects of rounding or other administrative matters in completing the Arrangement, up to a maximum of 44,500,000 PPR Shares are potentially issuable pursuant to the Arrangement. The Company expects, however, that no Marquee warrants or stock options will be exercised and that the number of PPR Shares in fact issued under the Arrangement will therefore not exceed 38.7 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In connection with the Arrangement, PPR has also agreed to or otherwise anticipates completing the ancillary transactions described below involving the issue or potential issue of PPR Shares.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Delivery of shares to Marquee's term loan lender on early repayment</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Company anticipates delivering up to a maximum of 4,400,000 PPR Shares to Crown Capital Partner Funding, LP ("Crown"), as lender under Marquee's outstanding $30,000,000 five-year term loan, in connection with the repayment of that loan on closing of the Arrangement. The Crown loan bears interest at 10% per annum and matures on May 30, 2022, and is not currently subject to a prepayment right. Effective May 31, 2019, prepayment is allowed but only on payment of a prepayment fee. The prepayment fee is 3% of the repaid principal for any prepayment made between May 31, 2019 and May 30, 2020.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To facilitate the refinancing of Marquee's indebtedness to Crown on closing, PPR and Marquee entered into an agreement with Crown to allow for early repayment of the loan (including unpaid interest and reimbursable costs, if any) without payment of a cash fee but subject to delivery of such number of whole PPR Shares as have an aggregate value, based on the 10-day volume weighted average trading price of the PPR Shares on the TSX before the effective date of the Arrangement, equal to $1,500,000 – to a maximum of 4,400,000 PPR Shares. Although no discount is intended, it is possible that the 10-day volume-weighted average trading price of the PPR Shares is less than the 5-day price generally contemplated under TSX rules. Based on the aggregate $1,500,000 issue price, the limit on the number of PPR Shares issuable to Crown to not more than 4,400,000 results in an effective minimum issue price per share of $0.341. To Prairie Provident's knowledge, Crown does not currently own any securities of the Company.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Expansion of Prairie Provident's existing credit arrangements</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Company’s wholly-owned subsidiary, <span class="companylink">Prairie Provident Resources Canada Ltd</span>. ("PPR Canada"), obtained commitment letters for an expansion of its existing credit arrangements with <span class="companylink">Prudential Capital Group</span> ("Prudential") on completion of the Arrangement. Borrowings under the expanded credit will be used, in part, to finance repayment of Marquee's indebtedness at closing (including the Crown term loan).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">PPR Canada's existing credit arrangements with Prudential are comprised of (i) a US$45 million senior secured revolving note facility (the "Revolving Facility") due October 31, 2020, and (ii) US$16 million original principal amount of senior subordinated notes due October 31, 2021 ("Subordinated Notes"). The Revolving Facility is a borrowing base facility based on, among other things, proved reserves, and is subject to semi-annual redetermination. Amounts borrowed under the Revolving Facility can be drawn in the form of USD or CAD prime advances bearing interest based on reference bank USD and CAD prime lending rates announced from time to time, or LIBOR advances (in the case of USD amounts) or CDOR advances (in the case of CAD amounts) bearing interest based on LIBOR and CDOR rates in effect from time to time, plus an applicable margin. The Subordinated Notes bear interest at 15% per annum, with up to 5% per annum payable in-kind at PPR Canada's election. Interest amounts paid in-kind are deferred and become additional principal payable at maturity. The terms of the Revolving Facility require that PPR Canada make the maximum in-kind election.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The expanded credit arrangements with Prudential involve an increase in the Revolving Facility from US$45 million to US$65 million and the issue of up to an additional US$12.5 million principal amount of Subordinated Notes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In connection with the expansion, PPR will issue to Prudential 6,000,000 share purchase warrants (the "Lender Warrants"), each of which will entitle the holder to purchase one PPR Share at a price not less than the 5-day volume weighted average trading price of the PPR Shares on the TSX before the closing date. The Lender Warrants will have a five-year term, be subject to customary anti-dilution and other adjustments for certain events, and provide for a "cashless exercise" alternative pursuant to which the holder may exercise Warrants on a net basis, without payment of funds, and receive a lesser number of shares based on the "in-the-money" value of the exercised Warrants and the then-current market price of the PPR Shares. The Lender Warrants are in addition to warrants to purchase up to 2,318,000 PPR Shares currently held by Prudential.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Private placement of subscription receipts</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On October 11, 2018, PPR completed a private placement (the "Private Placement") of 2,780,000 subscription receipts at a price of $0.39 per unit, with each subscription receipt entitling the holder to receive, in connection with completion of the Arrangement, one PPR Share and one-half of one share purchase warrant. Each whole warrant ("Investor Warrant") will entitle the holder to subscribe for and purchase one PPR Share at an exercise price of $0.50 until October 11, 2020 (subject to adjustment in certain circumstances).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 2,780,000 subscription receipts sold in the Private Placement on October 11, 2018 are in addition to the 6,810,200 subscription receipts (and 3,750,150 flow-through common shares) distributed by the Company in a 'bought deal' prospectus offering completed on the same date.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The proceeds from the sale of the subscription receipts are currently held in escrow and will be released to PPR in connection with closing of the Arrangement, failing which they will be refunded to the purchasers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Assuming that the maximum 4,400,000 PPR Shares are delivered to Crown on early repayment of its term loan to Marquee, that 2,780,000 underlying PPR Shares and 1,390,000 underlying Investor Warrants are issued pursuant to the 2,780,000 subscription receipts sold in the Private Placement, that the 6,000,000 Lender Warrants are issued, and that all such Investor Warrants and Lender Warrants are duly exercised in the future, then up to 14,570,000 PPR Shares are potentially issuable pursuant to these ancillary transactions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The maximum PPR Shares issuable under the ancillary transactions, when added to the maximum 44,500,000 PPR Shares that could be issued pursuant to the Arrangement as described above, result in an aggregate maximum of 59,070,000 PPR Shares potentially being issuable under and in connection with the Arrangement, representing approximately 49% to the 119,514,260 PPR Shares currently outstanding (on a non-diluted basis). It is this level of share issuance for which shareholder approval is required under TSX rules and is being obtained by way of written consent in lieu of a shareholders' meeting.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the circumstances of a public company acquisition transaction, the TSX will generally not require further securityholder approval for the issuance of up to an additional 25% of the number of securities approved for issuance by securityholders, provided that the additional securities are made issuable to target securityholders pursuant to an increase in the consideration offered under the transaction. Accordingly, the TSX will generally not require further shareholder approval for the issuance of up to an additional 11,125,000 PPR Shares under the Arrangement, such number being 25% of the number of PPR Shares approved for the Arrangement. No such increase is contemplated, however.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Each insider of the Company holding PPR Shares will experience dilution of their shareholdings from the Arrangement and ancillary transactions that is proportionately equivalent to the dilution experienced by the general body of Prairie Provident shareholders. No insider of the Company otherwise has an interest (direct or indirect) in the Arrangement or the ancillary transactions, no new control person or insider will be created as a result of completing them, and there are no reasonable grounds to believe that completion could materially affect control of the Company.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The terms of the Arrangement were negotiated at arm's length between Prairie Provident and Marquee, and the respective counterparties to the ancillary transactions similarly deal at arm's length with the Company.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Canadian oil prices, especially heavy crude prices, have been enormously low over the past year because of the lack of pipeline capacity. The press is full of accounts of Alberta and its oil producers losing up to $100million a day because of high discounted oil prices. This situation is likely to continue for the next two to three years and lead to enormous losses for Canadian producers and the Alberta government.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This is particularly significant for Alberta, as it holds royalty rights over virtually all production by virtue of its ownership of the bulk of the province's mineral rights. That makes it the largest identifiable revenue loser.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Low Canadian oil prices call for an old remedy: pro-rationing. The essence of the system is to limit production amounts in a pro-rata form, resulting in less production – a large reduction of economic waste – but leading, obviously, to higher prices. In the Canadian context, this is not dissimilar to the Ontario and Quebec milk producers' cartel that, by supply management, effectively raises prices on smaller, controlled production volumes. The major difference between the oil producers and milk producers is the oil in Alberta is actually owned by the province, while the milk producers benefit from a structurally beneficial cartel arrangement based on political considerations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I have been privileged to work in the energy business in Western Canada since 1965 – and before anyone jumps to the conclusion that I have become a socialist, I would refer them to my longstanding association with a pioneer of political economy, Adam Smith. I was born in the same town as Smith and organized the refurbishment of his neglected gravesite in Edinburgh. On reading Smith in detail, it is apparent that he strongly backs a very limited government interference in business affairs but points to the need for government to intervene when necessary. He even advocated immediate retaliation should trading partners increase tariffs on British goods. This issue is very relevant today, in this era of dysfunctional free trade.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I would also refer everyone to the intervention by the states of Texas and Oklahoma, in 1933 to stabilize oil prices there. At that time, because of a surge in oil production, prices fell to 10 US cents a barrel, provoking intense anger and violence by the royalty holders, which in Texas were predominately individuals. The pro-ration scheme that was then announced immediately increased the price of oil to around a US$1 a barrel, but by then the surplus was so great that pro-rationing lasted until early 1970. During that period, however, allowable production gradually increased and prices rose quickly to acceptable levels.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In addition, in 1950, after the massive oil discovery at Leduc in 1947, Alberta also imposed a prorationing scheme to prevent the limited pipeline capacity from being flooded with excess production. The statute is likely still on the books, and so further legislation would probably not be needed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While a new pro-rationing scheme in Alberta is fraught with problems, such as equitably sharing production, dealing with conventional producers versus oil sands plants, pipeline and rail contracts, and administration difficulties, the result would be worth the effort.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite manifold cries of oxes being gored, the result would mean new wells could be drilled and completed with an assured outlet for a proportion of new production, and at an acceptable price. It would also clinch Alberta's hold over the Canadian energy supply-and-demand balance in Canada. Obviously, the rate of pro-rationing would be reduced if and when new pipeline capacity becomes available.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A complaint about changing the rules of Alberta oil production can be rebutted by the fact that in my career in the energy business, royalties have been unilaterally changed three times and have demonstrated Alberta's ability to adjust regulations for the benefit of its citizens.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Finally, if any one complains that such a program would result in reduced foreign investment in the energy business in Western Canada, I can assure them that most foreign entities who could sell, did, and currently there is a complete vacuum of new foreign investment capital. It is possible that pro-ration could attract new capital whereby a guaranteed access to market, at lower production volumes, would be offset by higher prices.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Band member Denise Ominayak could hardly believe it.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I'm excited, I'm happy, but I'm still asking myself, 'Is this really happening?'"</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ominayak was one of dozens of band members who crowded into the tiny school gym in Little Buffalo as federal, provincial and band officials signed a deal expected to change everything in the community of about 640.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"This is a huge milestone for us," said Lubicon Lake First Nation Chief Billy-Joe Laboucan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Whatever we're doing here today impacts all of the children going to school here and all the children yet to be born."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Lubicons were missed during Treaty 8 negotiations in the late 1800s and had been fighting for a land claim of their own since the 1930s. Their struggle and the abject conditions they were living in eventually gained international attention.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Half the band's homes still have no running water. Many are mouldy. Others are overcrowded.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ominayak said she left Little Buffalo in 1989 when her then-one-year-old son developed fevers and rashes that she attributes to bad housing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There's a lot of people here that still live in homes where they have to go outside to go to the bathroom," she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That may change. Signing on to Treaty 8 comes with 246 square kilometres of land and $113 million in federal and provincial funds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The list of upgrades the money will pay for is long. The band anticipates more than 140 new homes, a new school, new firehall with a truck, a health centre, a community hall with indoor rink, 12 kilometres of road upgrades and a fibre-optic link.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Lubicon Lake has waited far too long for their land claim," said Alberta Premier Rachel Notley, who remembers discussing the band's plight around the dinner table as a girl with her father, former Alberta NDP leader Grant Notley.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I thought about how kids from Lubicon Lake my own age must have felt knowing … such a basic and obvious justice had been denied them."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Lubicon issue resurfaced in the 1970s, when oil and gas companies began carving through local traplines. By then, the Lubicon were so poor that diseases such as tuberculosis were problems.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Lubicon gained a global podium when they held a protest at the 1988 Calgary Olympics and blockaded roads into what they called their land. The United Nations and <span class="companylink">Amnesty International</span> criticized Canada for its treatment of the band.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A provisional deal was signed in 1988 with then-premier Don Getty, but it was never implemented. It formed the basis for today's deal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Your fight became almost a talisman of what the fight for Indigenous rights was and meant, not only to Canada, but to the world," said Carolyn Bennett, federal minister of Crown-Indigenous relations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Not everyone supports the deal. Bernard Ominayak, the chief who led the Lubicon through some of their stormiest protests, did not attend Tuesday's ceremony.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Laboucan thanked the former chief, but said it's time to move forward.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The past, that's over," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Denise Ominayak, attracted by how things are looking up, moved back home about five years ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I've seen the community drastically change," she said. "It's a huge thing for the whole community.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I'm just thankful and proud."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CALGARY, Alberta, Nov. 13, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- <span class="companylink">Bengal Energy Ltd</span>. (TSX: BNG) (“Bengal” or the “Company”) today announces its development program for 2019 and financial results for the second quarter of fiscal 2019 ended September 30, 2018.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CALENDAR 2019 DEVELOPMENT FORECAST:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">* 2019 Drilling Program – Bengal and its joint venture partners on the ATP 752 Barta Block will participate in a six well drilling program in the Cuisinier oil field commencing in Q2 2019 targeting high graded targets for productivity, reserves growth and pool expansion. (Bengal’s working interest is 30.357%.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">* Hydraulic Stimulation Program – In January 2019, the Company and its joint venture partners will hydraulically stimulate the Cuisinier-19 well and connect it for production. This well encountered a 12.5 m thick, oil-bearing section of Murta sandstone and is in a portion of the oil field anticipated to have virgin reservoir pressure. Other stimulation candidates continue to be identified for upcoming programs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">* Water Injection Pilot – A water injection pilot project will be commenced in Q2 2019. This program is designed to begin increasing pressure in the pool and thereby increase the expected oil recovery in both productivity and reserves. All of the above growth objectives will be funded by the Company’s cash balance and cash flows.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">FISCAL Q2 2019 SUMMARY:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">* Sales Revenue – Crude oil sales revenue was $3.3 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2019, which is 38% higher than the $2.4 million recorded in fiscal Q2 2018 and 3% higher than fiscal Q1 2019, mainly due to increased US Brent pricing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">* Hedging – For the period April 2018 through December 2018, Bengal has 65,261 barrels (“bbls”) hedged, using both puts and swaps at US$ 47/bbl. In addition, the Company hedged 15,906 bbls for the period January 2019 to March 2019 using both puts and swaps at US$ 55.40/bbl. For the period April 2019 to June 2019, the Company hedged three tranches of 5,000 bbls (15,000 bbls) using swaps at $73.28, $72.92 and $72.58 respectively. Finally, for the period July 2019 to September 2019, the Company hedged three tranches of 5,000 bbls (15,000 bbls) using swaps at US$75.03, US$74.69 and US$74.37 respectively. This hedging program is required under the Company’s credit facility.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">* Funds Flow from Operations – Bengal generated funds flow from operations of $0.8 million in the current quarter, which is a 582% increase from the $0.1 million generated in the second quarter of fiscal 2018. The primary reason for the increased funds flow performance in Q2 fiscal 2019 was the significant improvement in cash generated by operations due to the increase in US Brent pricing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">* Net Income (Loss) – Bengal reported a net loss of $0.7 million for the current quarter compared to net loss of $0.5 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2018.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">* Adjusted Net Earnings – Bengal reported a net loss of $0.7 million for the current quarter fiscal 2019. Adjusting the net loss for unrealized gain on financial instruments, the unrealized foreign exchange loss for the period and the non-cash impairment of non-current assets, the adjusted net earnings is $0.4 million for the second quarter fiscal 2019. </p>

 (1)  Netback is a non-IFRS measure and includes realized gain on financial instruments. Netback per bbl is calculated by dividing revenue (including realized gain on financial instruments) less royalties and operating costs by the total production of the Company measured in bbls.
 
 (2)  Funds from operations per share is a non-IFRS measure calculated by dividing funds from operations by weighted average basic and diluted shares outstanding for the periods disclosed.
 
 (3)  Adjusted net earnings and adjusted net earnings per share are non-IFRS measures.  The comparable IFRS measure is net income (loss).  A reconciliation of the two measures can be found in the table on page 18 of Bengal’s fiscal 2019 Q2 Management’s Discussion and Analysis (“MD&A”).

The use of any of the words "plan", "expect", "prospective", "project", "intend", "believe", "should", "anticipate", "estimate", or other similar words or statements that certain events "may" or "will" occur are intended to identify forward-looking statements. The projections, estimates and beliefs contained in such forward-looking statements are based on management’s estimates, opinions, and assumptions at the time the statements were made, including assumptions relating to: the impact of economic conditions in North America and Australia and globally; industry conditions; changes in laws and regulations including, without limitation, the adoption of new environmental laws and regulations and changes in how they are interpreted and enforced; increased competition; the availability of qualified operating or management personnel; fluctuations in commodity prices, foreign exchange or interest rates; stock market volatility and fluctuations in market valuations of companies with respect to announced transactions and the final valuations thereof; results of exploration and testing activities; and the ability to obtain required approvals and extensions from regulatory authorities.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Non-IFRS Measurements</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Within this release, references are made to terms commonly used in the oil and gas industry. Netbacks, netbacks per barrel, funds from operations, funds from operations per share, adjusted net earnings and adjusted net earnings per share do not have any standardized meaning under IFRS and are referred to as non-IFRS measures. Netback equals total revenue (including realized (loss) gain on financial instruments) less royalties and operating expenses. Netback per barrel equals netback divided by the applicable number of barrels. Management utilizes these measures for operational performance. Funds from operations is defined as cash from operations before changes in non-cash working capital. Funds from operations per share is a non-IFRS measure calculated by dividing funds from operations by weighted average basic and diluted shares outstanding for the periods disclosed. Adjusted net earnings is a non-IFRS measure, which should not be considered an alternative to “Net income (loss)” as presented in the consolidated statement of income (loss) and comprehensive income (loss), and is presented in the Company’s financial reports to assist management and investors in analyzing financial performance net of gains and losses outside of management’s immediate control. Adjusted net earnings equal net income (loss) less unrealized losses/gains on foreign exchange and unrealized losses/gains on financial instruments plus non-cash impairment of non-current assets. Adjusted net earnings per share is calculated based on the weighted average number of common shares outstanding consistent with the calculation of earnings (loss) per share. Management utilizes these measures to analyze operating performance. The Company’s calculation of the non-IFRS measures included herein may differ from the calculation of similar measures by other issuers. Therefore, the Company’s non-IFRS measures may not be comparable to other similar measures used by other issuers. Funds from operations is not intended to represent operating profit for the period nor should it be viewed as an alternative to operating profit, net income, cash flow from operations or other measures of financial performance calculated in accordance with IFRS. Non-IFRS measures should only be used in conjunction with the Company’s annual audited and interim financial statements. A reconciliation of these measures can be found in the table on page 18 of Bengal’s fiscal 2019 Q2 MD&A.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CALGARY, Alberta, Nov. 13, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- <span class="companylink">Canacol Energy Ltd</span>. (“Canacol” or the “Corporation”) (TSX:CNE; OTCQX:CNNEF; BVC:CNEC) is pleased to report its financial and operating results for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018. Dollar amounts are expressed in United States dollars, except as otherwise noted.</p>

Charle Gamba, President and CEO of the Corporation, commented: “Q3 2018 was another successful quarter for Canacol as we increased the Corporation’s realized contractual gas sales by 52% to 115 MMscfpd, up from 76 MMscfpd during the same period in 2017. Additionally, our average gas sales price (net of transportation expenses) remained strong at $4.80/Mcf for Q3 2018, which was higher than our prior guidance, and we also achieved a strong natural gas netback of $3.80/Mcf for Q3 2018. Our strong realized contractual gas sales and natural gas netback during Q3 2018 generated $36.8 million of cash flow from operations (compared to $11.8 million, a 212% increase from Q3 2017), resulting in a $12.1 net income during the quarter (compared to a $1.5 million net loss in Q3 2017).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For the remainder of 2018, Management remains focused on completing the work necessary to raise production to 230 MMscfpd upon completion of the new 100 MMscfpd <span class="companylink">Promigas</span> pipeline, which includes completing the expansion of the gas processing facility at Jobo, and tying in the various discoveries that we have made over the past 12 months. The Corporation will also spud the first of a planned nine well gas exploration and development drilling program in mid-December, with the Nelson-13 development well. <span class="companylink">Promigas</span> anticipates that all of the additional 100 MMscfpd of capacity will be available in March 2019, with the first 20 MMscfpd available on December 1, 2018.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Highlights for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018(Production is stated as working-interest before royalties)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Financial and operational highlights of the Corporation include:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">* Average production volumes increased 33% and 27% to 21,978 boepd and 21,488 boepd for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018, respectively, compared to 16,587 boepd and 16,913 boepd for the same periods in 2017, respectively. The increase is primarily due to an increase in gas production as a result of the additional sales related to the completion of the Sabanas pipeline, offset by a decrease in oil sale resulting from the sale of the Ecuador Incremental Production Contract (the “Ecuador IPC”) (see full discussion in MD&A) on February 15, 2018.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">* Realized contractual sales volumes increased 34% and 25% to 22,176 boepd and 21,615 boepd for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018, respectively, compared to 16,606 boepd and 17,276 boepd for the same periods in 2017, respectively. The increase is primarily due to increase in gas production as a result of the additional sales related to the completion of the Sabanas pipeline, offset by a decrease in oil sale resulting from the sale of the Ecuador IPC on February 15, 2018.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">* Total petroleum and natural gas revenues for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018 increased 56% and 44% to $59.1 million and $168.1 million, respectively, compared to $38 million and $116.8 million for same periods in 2017, respectively. Adjusted petroleum and natural gas revenues, inclusive of revenues related to the Ecuador IPC until February 15, 2018, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018 increased 37% and 28% to $59.1 million and $170 million, respectively, compared to $43.3 million and $133.2 million for same periods in 2017, respectively.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">* Cash flow from operations increased 212% and 90% to $36.8 million and $76.5 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018, respectively, compared to $11.8 million and $40.3 million for the same periods in 2017, respectively.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">* Adjusted funds from operations increased 40% and 23% to $26.5 million and $78.8 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018, respectively, compared to $18.9 million and $63.9 million for the same periods in 2017, respectively. Adjusted funds from operations are inclusive of results from the Ecuador IPC until February 15, 2018.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">* The Corporation recorded a net income of $12.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2018, compared to a net loss of $1.5 million for the same period in 2017. The Corporation recorded a net loss of $5.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2018, compared to a net income of $2.3 million for the same period in 2017. The net loss for the nine months ended September 30, 2018 was mainly attributable to a) a one-time non-cash exploration impairment expense of $9.9 million and b) a one-time loss on settlement of the prior credit facility of $14.4 million ($9.4 million non-cash), both of which were recorded in Q2 2018.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">* Net capital expenditures including acquisitions for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018 were $18.6 million and $89.9 million, respectively, while adjusted capital expenditures including acquisitions, inclusive of amounts related to the Ecuador IPC until February 15, 2018, were $18.6 million and $92.3 million, respectively. Net capital expenditures and adjusted capital expenditures included non-cash costs of $0.5 million and $20.5 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018, respectively.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">* During the three months ended September 30, 2018, the Corporation declared a return of capital in the amount of $20 million via the distribution of 22,598,870 of common shares of <span class="companylink">Arrow Exploration Corp</span>. (“Arrow’s Shares”). Arrow’s Shares were held in trust as at September 30, 2018. Each common share of Canacol is entitled to a distribution of 0.127 Arrow’s Shares. The distribution was completed on November 6, 2018.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">* At September 30, 2018, the Corporation had $53.5 million in cash and $5.4 million in restricted cash. Outlook</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For the remainder of 2018, the Corporation remains focused on achieving 230 MMscfpd of productive capacity via the expansion of the gas processing facilities at Jobo and the tying in of the Pandereta-1, 2, 3, Canahuate-1 and Canahuate-3 wells by December 2018. The Corporation completed the de-bottlenecking of the Betania-to-Jobo flowline in October 2018, and is currently completing the Pandereta-to-Jobo flowline. The expansion of the Jobo gas processing facility is progressing as planned, and will add another 130 MMscfpd of capacity to the facility bring total processing capacity to 330 MMscfpd. <span class="companylink">Promigas</span> anticipates that all of the additional 100 MMscfpd of capacity will be available in March 2019, with the first 20 MMscfpd available on December 1, 2018.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Corporation has contracted a drilling rig and will spud the first of a planned nine well gas exploration and development drilling program in mid-December 2018, with the Nelson-13 development well.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Canacol is an exploration and production company with operations focused in Colombia. The Corporation’s shares are traded on the Toronto Stock Exchange under the symbol CNE, the OTCQX in the United States of America under the symbol CNNEF, the Bolsa de Valores de Colombia under the symbol CNEC and the <span class="companylink">Bolsa Mexicana de Valores</span> under the symbol CNEN.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This press release contains certain forward-looking statements within the meaning of applicable securities law. Forward-looking statements are frequently characterized by words such as “plan”, “expect”, “project”, “target”, “intend”, “believe”, “anticipate”, “estimate” and other similar words, or statements that certain events or conditions “may” or “will” occur, including without limitation statements relating to estimated production rates from the Corporation’s properties and intended work programs and associated timelines. Forward-looking statements are based on the opinions and estimates of management at the date the statements are made and are subject to a variety of risks and uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual events or results to differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements. The Corporation cannot assure that actual results will be consistent with these forward looking statements. They are made as of the date hereof and are subject to change and the Corporation assumes no obligation to revise or update them to reflect new circumstances, except as required by law. Information and guidance provided herein supersedes and replaces any forward looking information provided in prior disclosures. Prospective investors should not place undue reliance on forward looking statements. These factors include the inherent risks involved in the exploration for and development of crude oil and natural gas properties, the uncertainties involved in interpreting drilling results and other geological and geophysical data, fluctuating energy prices, the possibility of cost overruns or unanticipated costs or delays and other uncertainties associated with the oil and gas industry. Other risk factors could include risks associated with negotiating with foreign governments as well as country risk associated with conducting international activities, and other factors, many of which are beyond the control of the Corporation. Other risks are more fully described in the Corporation’s most recent Management Discussion and Analysis (“MD&A”) and Annual Information Form, which are incorporated herein by reference and are filed on SEDAR at www.sedar.com[http://www.sedar.com]. Average production figures for a given period are derived using arithmetic averaging of fluctuating historical production data for the entire period indicated and, accordingly, do not represent a constant rate of production for such period and are not an indicator of future production performance. Detailed information in respect of monthly production in the fields operated by the Corporation in Colombia is provided by the Corporation to the <span class="companylink">Ministry of Mines and Energy of Colombia</span> and is published by the Ministry on its website; a direct link to this information is provided on the Corporation’s website. References to “net” production refer to the Corporation’s working-interest production before royalties.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Use of Non-IFRS Financial Measures – Due to the nature of the equity method of accounting the Corporation applies under IFRS 11 to its interest in the Ecuador IPC, the Corporation does not record its proportionate share of revenues and expenditures as would be typical in oil and gas joint interest arrangements. Management has provided supplemental measures of adjusted revenues and expenditures, which are inclusive of the Ecuador IPC, to supplement the IFRS disclosures of the Corporation’s operations in this press release. Such supplemental measures should not be considered as an alternative to, or more meaningful than, the measures as determined in accordance with IFRS as an indicator of the Corporation’s performance, and such measures may not be comparable to that reported by other companies. This press release also provides information on adjusted funds from operations. Adjusted funds from operations is a measure not defined in IFRS. It represents cash provided by operating activities before changes in non-cash working capital and decommissioning obligation expenditures, and includes the Corporation’s proportionate interest of those items that would otherwise have contributed to funds from operations from the Ecuador IPC had it been accounted for under the proportionate consolidation method of accounting. The Corporation considers adjusted funds from operations a key measure as it demonstrates the ability of the business to generate the cash flow necessary to fund future growth through capital investment and to repay debt. Adjusted funds from operations should not be considered as an alternative to, or more meaningful than, cash provided by operating activities as determined in accordance with IFRS as an indicator of the Corporation’s performance. The Corporation’s determination of adjusted funds from operations may not be comparable to that reported by other companies. For more details on how the Corporation reconciles its cash provided by operating activities to adjusted funds from operations, please refer to the “Non-IFRS Measures” section of the Corporation’s MD&A. Additionally, this press release references working capital, EBITDAX and operating netback measures. Working capital is calculated as current assets less current liabilities, excluding non-cash items, and is used to evaluate the Corporation’s financial leverage. EBITDAX is defined as consolidated net income adjusted for interest, income taxes, depreciation, depletion, amortization, exploration expenses, share of joint venture profit/loss and other similar non-recurring or non-cash charges. Consolidated EBITDAX is further adjusted for the contribution to adjusted funds from operations, before taxes, of the results of the Ecuador IPC. Operating netback is a benchmark common in the oil and gas industry and is calculated as total petroleum and natural gas sales, less royalties, less production and transportation expenses, calculated on a per barrel of oil equivalent basis of sales volumes using a conversion. Operating netback is an important measure in evaluating operational performance as it demonstrates field level profitability relative to current commodity prices. Working capital, EBITDAX and operating netback as presented do not have any standardized meaning prescribed by IFRS and therefore may not be comparable with the calculation of similar measures for other entities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Operating netback is defined as revenues less royalties and production and transportation expenses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Realized contractual gas sales is defined as gas produced and sold plus gas revenues received from nominated take or pay contracts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Boe Conversion – The term “boe” is used in this news release. Boe may be misleading, particularly if used in isolation. A boe conversion ratio of cubic feet of natural gas to barrels oil equivalent is based on an energy equivalency conversion method primarily applicable at the burner tip and does not represent a value equivalency at the wellhead. In this news release, we have expressed boe using the Colombian conversion standard of 5.7 Mcf: 1 bbl required by the <span class="companylink">Ministry of Mines and Energy of Colombia</span>. As the value ratio between natural gas and crude oil based on the current prices of natural gas and crude oil is significantly different from the energy equivalency of 5.7:1, utilizing a conversion on a 5.7:1 basis may be misleading as an indication of value.</p>

Fleeing violence and discrimination back home because of their gender identity or sexual orientation, these LGBTQ migrants find the journey north to be just as threatening amid catcalls and even physical abuse.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">D6 Block in IndiaTo date, the Company has not been successful in its efforts to sell its interest in the D6 Block in India or secure financing for funding of its share of the R-Cluster, Satellite Cluster and MJ development projects in the block. While these efforts are continuing, to conserve its remaining cash (approximately $3.6 million as of September 30, 2018), the Company elected not to pay a D6 Block cash call that was due in early October, 2018.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Subsequently, a subsidiary of the Company received a default notice from the operator of the D6 production sharing contract (“PSC”) in India for non-payment of the cash call. Under the terms of the joint operating agreement (“JOA”) between the participating interest holders in the D6 PSC, during the continuance of a default, the defaulting party shall not have a right to its share of revenue (which shall vest in and be the property of the non-defaulting parties who have paid to cover the amount in default). In addition, if the defaulting party does not cure a default within sixty days of the default notice, the non-defaulting parties have the option to require the defaulting party to withdraw from the D6 PSC and JOA.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The receipt of the default notice from the operator of the D6 PSC resulted in an event of default under the terms of the Company’s Facilities Agreement with its senior lenders (the “Lenders”). No action has been taken by the Lenders and the Company continues to have discussions with the Lenders with whom the Company believes it has a positive relationship. The Company has requested that, under the terms of the Facilities Agreement, some or all of the Lenders provide a senior loan facility for funding of D6 Block expenditures. None of the Lenders is under any obligation to provide this loan facility and, to date, none of the Lenders have offered to provide this loan facility.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If the default under the D6 JOA is not cured on a timely basis and the non-defaulting parties request that Niko withdraw from the D6 PSC and JOA, then this will have a material adverse impact on the Company’s stakeholders. No assurance whatsoever can be made that the Company will be able to meet its funding requirements under the D6 PSC or its other obligations on a timely basis or at all.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Block 9 in BangladeshIn the first quarter of fiscal 2019, the Company was notified by the operator of the Block 9 PSC that Bangladesh Oil, Gas and Mineral Corporation (“<span class="companylink">Petrobangla</span>”) had paid funds to the operator of the Block 9 for recovery of costs incurred by the operator related to Niko Block 9’s interest in Block 9 and the Company understands that <span class="companylink">Petrobangla</span> has continued to do so for subsequent periods. The estimated cumulative amount of non-payments by <span class="companylink">Petrobangla</span> of amounts due for Niko’s share of the profit petroleum portion of invoiced amounts due for gas and condensate sales supplied pursuant to the Block 9 gas and condensate sales agreements for March 2016 to September 2018 is $35 million. Refer to Note 30(a)(ii) of the audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended March 31, 2018 for further details on this matter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Efforts to Realize ValueThe Company is continuing its efforts to realize value from its core assets. Per the Waterfall Distribution mechanism defined in the agreements governing the Term Loan and the convertible notes of the Company, 100% of any net proceeds received for these assets up to $180 million would be payable to the Lenders of the Term Loan. As such, if the Company were able to conclude any transaction to realize value up to $180 million, this value would be required to be distributed to the Lenders. No assurance whatsoever can be made that the Company will realize any value for its core assets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Contingent LiabilitiesThe Company and its subsidiaries are subject to various claims from other parties, as described in Note 30 of the audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended March 31, 2018 and updated in Note 9 of the condensed interim consolidated financial statements for the quarter ended September 30, 2018, and are actively defending against these claims. An adverse outcome on one or more of these claims could significantly impact the future cash flows of the Company.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ability of the Company to Continue as a Going ConcernAs a result of the foregoing matters (including the ongoing obligations, defaults and contingent liabilities of the Company and its subsidiaries), there are material uncertainties that may cast significant doubt about the ability of the Company to continue as a going concern.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Complete details of the Company's financial results are contained in its condensed interim consolidated financial statements and Management’s Discussion and Analysis for the quarter ended September 30, 2018, which will be available under the Company’s SEDAR profile at www.sedar.com[http://www.sedar.com].</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">RESULTS OF OPERATIONS</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The following significant items impacted the Company’s financial results for the second quarter of fiscal 2019:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Impairment of Assets, net of Derecognition of Associated LiabilitiesAs at September 30, 2018, the Company determined that the realization of value from its D6 and Block 9 property, plant and equipment and exploration and evaluation assets, inventory, restricted cash, income tax and other receivables was substantially dependent on uncertain events that were not wholly within the control of the Company. As such, in the second quarter of fiscal 2019, the Company recognized impairments of these assets, net of associated liabilities, totalling $222 million, reducing the carrying value of these balance sheet items to nil.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Revaluation of Long-term Debt As a result of the impairment of the assets noted above, the Company revalued its long-term debt as at September 30, 2018 to nil, resulting in the recognition of a gain on revaluation of long-term debt of $211 million.</p>

Total sales volumes in the second quarter of fiscal 2019 of 61 MMcfe/d decreased from 77 MMcfe/d in the second quarter of fiscal 2018 primarily due to lower natural gas sales volumes from the D6 Block in India, lower sales volumes from Block 9 in Bangladesh, and the sale of the Company’s interest in the Hazira Block in India, effective October 1, 2017, partially offset by higher crude oil sales volumes from the D6 Block in India as the MA field ceased production in September 2018 at the end of the term of the contract for the floating, processing, storage and offloading vessel.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Net oil and natural gas revenue in the second quarter of fiscal 2019 increased slightly from the second quarter of fiscal 2018 primarily due to higher crude oil and natural gas prices and higher crude oil sales volumes, partially offset by lower natural gas sales volumes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">EBITDAX from continuing operations in the second quarter of fiscal 2019 increased from the second quarter of fiscal 2018 primarily due to a realized foreign exchange gain in the second quarter of fiscal 2019 versus a realized foreign exchange loss in the second quarter of fiscal 2018.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Net loss from continuing operations of $(34) million in the second quarter of fiscal 2019 increased compared to $(11) million in the second quarter of fiscal 2018 primarily due to increased depletion expense resulting from negative revisions to proved reserves for the D1 D3 and MA field in the D6 Block in India and the recognition of a net impairment loss of $11 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2019.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Non-IFRS MeasuresThe selected financial information presented throughout this press release is prepared in accordance with IFRS, except for “EBITDAX”. The Company utilizes EBITDAX to assess performance and to help determine its ability to fund future capital projects and to repay debt. EBITDAX is calculated as net income before interest expense, income taxes, depletion and depreciation expenses, exploration and evaluation expenses, and other items (impairment loss, net, share-based compensation expense, restructuring costs, accretion expense, non-cash finance and other income, commercial claim expense and unrealized foreign exchange gain or loss). EBITDAX should not be viewed as a substitute for measures of financial performance presented in accordance with IFRS or as a measure of a company’s profitability or liquidity. These non-IFRS measures do not have any standardized meaning prescribed by IFRS and therefore may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other companies. Refer to the Company's Management’s Discussion and Analysis for details on non-IFRS financial measures and reconciliation of non-IFRS measures to the most directly comparable measures defined under IFRS.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Forward-Looking InformationCertain statements in this press release constitute forward-looking information, including forward-looking information relating to the Company’s efforts to realize value from its core assets, the ability of the Company to fund its operations and meet its obligations, the Company defending certain claims and the possible actions of the Lenders. Such forward-looking information is based on a number of risks, uncertainties and assumptions, which may cause actual results or other expectations to differ materially from those anticipated and which may prove to be incorrect. Undue reliance should not be placed on forward-looking information. Such forward-looking information reflects the Company's current beliefs and assumptions and is based on information currently available to the Company. This forward-looking information is also based on certain key expectations and assumptions, many of which are not within the control of the Company. There can be no assurances that the Company will be able to successfully complete its strategic plan on a timely basis or that the Company will be able to meet the goals and purposes of its business plan (including resolving various disputes in its favour) or fund its cash requirements. In particular, the Company has not been successful in its efforts to sell its interest in the D6 Block in India or secure financing for funding of its share of the R-Cluster, Satellite Cluster and MJ development projects in the D6 Block, and while it will continue such efforts to enhance its liquidity there can be no assurance whatsoever that these efforts will be successful on a timely basis or at all. In addition, the Company has requested that the Lenders waive a default under the Facilities Agreement and fund a senior loan facility. The Lenders have not agreed to either request. Further, the Company’s ability to defend claims may be restricted or limited for various reasons. Absolutely no assurance can be made that the Company will be able to meet its funding requirements under the D6 PSC or its other obligations on a timely basis or at all, and nothing herein should be read as stating or inferring otherwise. The failure to meet or satisfy any of the foregoing is likely to have a material adverse impact on the Company and thereby significantly impair the value of security holders’ interest in the Company. The reader is cautioned that the assumptions used in the preparation of forward-looking information, although considered reasonable at the time of preparation, may prove to be incorrect. Actual results may vary from the information provided herein as a result of numerous known and unknown risks and uncertainties and other factors and such variations may be material. Such risk factors include, but are not limited to those set out above as well as: risks related to the ability of the Company to continue as a going concern, risks related to the Company not being able to increase its cash resources, the risks associated with the Company meeting its obligations under the amended Facilities Agreement, risks related to the various legal claims against the Company or its subsidiaries, as well as the risks associated with the oil and natural gas industry in general, such as operational risks in development, exploration and production, delays or changes in plans with respect to exploration or development projects or capital expenditures, the uncertainty of estimates and projections relating to production rates, costs and expenses, commodity price and exchange rate fluctuations, government regulation, marketing and transportation risks, environmental risks, competition, changes in tax, royalty and environmental legislation, the impact of general economic conditions, imprecision of reserve estimates, the lack of availability of qualified personnel or management, stock market volatility, risks associated with meeting all of the Company's financing obligations and contractual commitments (including work commitments), the risks discussed under "Risk Factors" in the Company's Annual Information Form for the year ended March 31, 2018 and in the Company's public disclosure documents, and other factors, many of which are beyond the Company's control. Niko makes no representation that the actual results achieved during the forecast period will be the same in whole or in part as those forecasts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The forward-looking information included in this press release is expressly qualified in its entirety by this cautionary statement. The forward-looking information included herein is made as of the date of this press release and Niko assumes no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking information to reflect new events or circumstances, except as required by law.</p>

</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">FINANCIAL AND OPERATING HIGHLIGHTS (THREE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2018)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">* Funds flow from operating activities of $1.93 million compared to $0.58 million recorded in the prior quarter, and $1.76 million reported in the third quarter of 2017. The increase from the prior quarter is primarily due to the expiration of our hedges on June 30, 2018, which had been responsible for a $1.56 million net realized derivative loss in the second quarter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">* WTI-WCS differentials widened towards the end of the quarter, which had a negative impact on Zargon’s realized field prices for our Alberta properties. For the 2018 third quarter, the WTI-WCS differential averaged $29.07 Canadian dollar per barrel, an increase of 17 percent compared to the prior quarter WTI-WCS differential of $24.82 Canadian dollar per barrel and 133 percent compared to $12.45 Canadian dollar per barrel in the third quarter of 2017.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">* Third quarter 2018 production averaged 1,953 barrels of oil equivalent per day, an eight percent decline from the preceding quarter rate of 2,118 barrels of oil equivalent per day and a 26 percent decline from the third quarter 2017 production rate of 2,628 barrels of oil equivalent per day. The reduction in production volumes was primarily due to the suspension of discretionary oil exploitation capital programs, the deferral of routine maintenance operations due to cash constraints and the shut-in of uneconomic natural gas properties.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">* Third quarter 2018 field operating netbacks defined as sales (excluding hedges) less royalties and operating/transportation costs were $20.89 per barrel of oil equivalent, essentially unchanged from the prior quarter field operating netback of $20.86 per barrel of oil equivalent. The corresponding third quarter 2018 field operating cash flow was $3.75 million, a seven percent decrease from the prior quarter’s $4.02 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">* For the third quarter of 2018, field revenues (unhedged) were $56.61 per barrel of oil equivalent per day ($56.23 per barrel of oil equivalent per day in Q2 2018), royalties were $8.57 per barrel of oil equivalent per day ($8.13 per barrel of oil equivalent per day in Q2 2018) and operating (including transportation) costs were $27.15 per barrel of oil equivalent per day ($27.24 per barrel of oil equivalent per day in Q2 2018).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">* Third quarter 2018 capital expenditures were $0.93 million, a 22 percent decrease from the prior quarter’s $1.19 million and a 47 percent decrease from the 2017 third quarter expenditures of $1.77 million. No wells were drilled in the quarter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">* Third quarter 2018 abandonment and reclamation costs totaled $0.24 million, unchanged from the $0.24 million recorded in the prior quarter, and 56 percent lower than the $0.55 million of costs in the 2017 third quarter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">* Zargon has included a going concern disclosure in its unaudited financial statements for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018 and the accompanying MD&A.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">* On November 2, 2018, subsequent to quarter end, Zargon announced that it had entered into a financing agreement for $3.50 million (US) term debt. These funds will be utilized for low risk oil exploitation capital projects and general corporate purposes. Strategic Alternatives Process Update</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Zargon’s Board of Directors recognizes that Zargon is a suboptimal size to operate as a public oil and gas company in Canada, and continues to explore alternatives to allow Zargon to continue as part of a larger, better capitalized entity, to reorganize the Company, or to sell the Company. The Board also recognizes, that Zargon’s long-life, low-decline oil exploitation assets have significant upside potential in a period of prolonged higher oil prices. In addition to this option value to higher oil prices, Zargon brings a TSX listing and more than $155 million of non-capital losses that could have significant value in a more favourable Canadian energy investment climate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In an effort to realize these unrecognized values, Zargon has previously initiated a strategic alternatives process and continues to seek outcomes that will maximize the value for the Company and its stakeholders.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This press release offers our assessment of Zargon’s future plans and operations as at November 13, 2018, and contains certain forward-looking information and statements within the meaning of applicable securities laws. The use of any of the words "anticipate”, “continue”, “estimate”, “expect”, “forecast”, “may”, “will”, “project”, “should”, “plan”, “intend”, “believe” and similar expressions (including the negatives thereof) are intended to identify forward-looking information or statements. In particular, but without limiting the foregoing, this news release contains forward-looking information and statements pertaining to the following: our expectations for the WTI-WCS differential; our expectations for the use of funds from our US term debt; and our strategic alternatives process under the heading “Strategic Alternatives Process Update”. In addition, all statements relating to reserves, including ASP reserves, in this press release are deemed to be forward-looking as they involve an implied assessment, based on certain assumptions and estimates, that the reserves described, can be properly produced in the future.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The forward-looking information and statements included in this news release are not guarantees of future performance and should not be unduly relied upon. Such information and statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause actual results or events to differ materially from those anticipated in such forward-looking information or statements including, without limitation: those relating to results of operations and financial condition; general economic conditions; industry conditions; changes in regulatory and taxation regimes; volatility of commodity prices; escalation of operating and capital costs; currency fluctuations; the availability of services; imprecision of reserve estimates; geological, technical, drilling and processing problems; environmental risks; weather; the lack of availability of qualified personnel or management; stock market volatility; the ability to access sufficient capital from internal and external sources; and competition from other industry participants for, among other things, capital, services, acquisitions of reserves, undeveloped lands and skilled personnel. Risks are described in more detail in our Annual Information Form, which is available on www.zargon.ca[https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=SpHZ-MeieE_-TC_UNVeT3vwLCgA5XaSK5RaCowG1jkS0QM-XlTtTsMj7BnbjgySQM1b5CTuOoglDExCskiKYAA==] and on www.sedar.com[https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=mnuXUXkJzfs6ox6JUrvhR5Dqi2DDzRz9Dd92JhunJj-L0yQukamyXl4c3AkGX4iuFgneWTFD6sm_VgLIrmc0VQ==]. Forward-looking statements are provided to allow investors to have a greater understanding of our business.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">You are cautioned that the assumptions used in the preparation of such information and statements, including, among other things: future oil and natural gas prices; future capital expenditure levels; future production levels; future exchange rates; the cost of developing and expanding our assets; our ability to obtain equipment in a timely manner to carry out development activities; our ability to market our oil and natural gas successfully to current and new customers; the impact of increasing competition; the availability of adequate and acceptable debt and equity financing and funds from operations to fund our planned expenditures; and our ability to add production and reserves through our development and acquisition activities, although considered reasonable at the time of preparation, may prove to be imprecise and, as such, undue reliance should not be placed on forward-looking statements. Our actual results, performance, or achievement could differ materially from those expressed in, or implied by, these forward-looking statements. We can give no assurance that any of the events anticipated will transpire or occur, or if any of them do, what benefits we will derive from them. The forward-looking information and statements contained in this document is expressly qualified by this cautionary statement.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Additional GAAP and Non-GAAP Financial Measures</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Zargon uses the following terms for measurement within this press release that do not have a standardized prescribed meaning under Canadian generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) and these measurements may not be comparable with the calculation of similar measurements of other entities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The terms “funds flow from operating activities” and “operating netback per boe” in this press release are not recognized measures under GAAP. Management of Zargon believes that in addition to net earnings and cash flows from operating activities as defined by GAAP, these terms are useful supplemental measures to evaluate operating performance and assess leverage. Users are cautioned; however, that these measures should not be construed as an alternative to net earnings or cash flows from operating activities determined in accordance with GAAP as an indication of Zargon’s performance.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Zargon considers funds flow from operating activities to be an important measure of Zargon’s ability to generate the funds necessary to finance capital expenditures and repay debt. All references to funds flow from operating activities throughout this press release are based on cash provided by operating activities before the change in non-cash working capital and asset retirement expenditures since Zargon believes the timing of collection, payment or incurrence of these items involves a high degree of discretion and, as such, may not be useful for evaluating Zargon’s operating performance. Zargon’s method of calculating funds flow from operating activities may differ from that of other companies and, accordingly, may not be comparable to measures used by other companies. Funds flow from operating activities per basic share is calculated using the same weighted average basic shares outstanding as is used in calculating earnings per basic share. See Zargon’s Management’s Discussion and Analysis (“MD&A”) as filed on www.zargon.ca[https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=SpHZ-MeieE_-TC_UNVeT3nCVbiPaElGd1mGhDvwmuf6ZlHC8MDyMUL_l0q-rBQ9nONrqsdYZwRd6_8GAbhNShA==] and on www.sedar.com[https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=mnuXUXkJzfs6ox6JUrvhR8kBq0j5HVYU1zF7zjS6BTiVJjUx5n7fIakGNetA97J3rx4iuWSxXbrSJTM1cu9YLA==] for the periods ended September 30, 2018 and 2017 for a discussion of cash flows from operating activities and funds flow from operating activities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">51-101 Advisory</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In conformity with National Instrument 51-101, Standards for Disclosure of Oil and Gas Activities (“NI 51-101”), natural gas volumes have been converted to barrels of oil equivalent (“boe”) using a conversion rate of six thousand cubic feet of natural gas to one barrel of oil. In certain circumstances, natural gas liquid volumes have been converted to a thousand cubic feet equivalent (“mcfe”) on the basis of one barrel of natural gas liquids to six thousand cubic feet of gas. Boes and mcfes may be misleading, particularly if used in isolation. A conversion ratio of one barrel to six thousand cubic feet of natural gas is based on an energy equivalency conversion method primarily applicable at the burner tip and does not represent a value equivalency at the wellhead. Given that the value ratio based on the current price of crude oil as compared to natural gas is significantly different from the energy equivalency of 6:1, utilizing a conversion ratio on a 6:1 basis may be misleading as an indication of value.</p>
