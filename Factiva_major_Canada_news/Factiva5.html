<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Union leader Jerry Dias is unabashedly channelling Trump's political brand to fight the General Motors shutdown in Oshawa[https://www.thestar.com/topic.oshawa.html], and urging Prime Minister Justin Trudeau to take some pages from the Trump playbook as well.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“If somebody has a better way to get <span class="companylink">General Motors</span>' attention, I'm all ears,” Dias, the head of Unifor, said as he floated the idea of punishing tariffs and joint, Canada-U. S. retaliation against GM and Mexico in the wake of the Oshawa closing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Asked whether he was urging Trudeau to be more like the U.S. president, Dias said, “I'm asking him to behave like Jerry Dias.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Immodesty aside, Dias's second day of rage provoked an intriguing question or two in the immediate aftermath of the GM announcement on Monday: Why was Dias the angriest public figure in Canada about this decision by <span class="companylink">General Motors</span>? Why did the prime minister and Ontario's premier seem so resigned to the shutdown and the almost certain loss of thousands of jobs?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It almost seemed like Trudeau, Doug Ford and Dias made a pact to divvy up the famous five stages of grief — the politicians took depression and acceptance, while the union leader plunged into bargaining, denial and anger.</p>

Editorial | Trudeau and Ford should speak louder for GM workers[https://www.thestar.com/opinion/editorials/2018/11/27/trudeau-and-ford-should-speak-louder-for-gm-workers.html]
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Plant shutdowns breed populist discontent, as we've learned with Trump's support in Rust Belt, U.S.A., and populism creates unexpected coalitions with unpredictable results. This is what is making the news about GM such a wild card in Canadian politics at the moment — it's whipping up many of the same sentiments that gave political heft to Trump, among some of the same demographics, notably men in the suburbs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Anger toward <span class="companylink">General Motors</span> is coming from the left and the right of the political spectrum in Canada. Union members feel betrayal about the unionized job losses, while Conservatives are wondering whether Stephen Harper's bailout of 10 years ago to the big automakers bought any loyalty from GM.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Repeated reports over the past few years, including one just about a month ago, have revealed that nearly one-third of the $13.7-billion bailout offered to the big automakers back in 2008 will never be recovered.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now, that is a story that the average taxpayer can understand, and certainly resent. It plays into the populist belief that the odds are stacked in favour of rich individuals and corporations — who only turn around and, in Dias' colourful turn of phrase on Tuesday, “give the finger” to everyone else.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Populist anger doesn't like the mushy, complicated middle, and that's where Trudeau's Liberals might need to watch their own political backs amid the fallout over GM's announced Oshawa shutdown.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For three years now, the Trudeau government has been trying to assure Canadians that there is a middle ground between the environment and the economy — and that we don't have to choose between the two.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That is not going to be an easy message to sell to laid-off GM workers or all those other middle-class autoworkers aspiring not to be laid off (to borrow a phrase) as carbon-heavy industries adopt to climate-change measures. GM, with its announced intentions to head into the electric and autonomous vehicle market, appears to confirm that saving the planet will come at a big personal cost to those in the old economy. This of course, isn't news to those in the resources industry, especially in Alberta, where currently record low oil prices are delivering a long, sustained blow to people's hopes and livelihoods in the West.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In short, the combined shocks in Oshawa and the West seem designed to sow disbelief that Canada is capable of transitioning to a greener economy without a huge price.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dias was heavily involved with the negotiations over a new Canada-U.S.-Mexico trade deal and, the union leader often sounded as suspicious as Trump about how Mexico was taking jobs away from the rest of North America. Dias was back on that soapbox on Tuesday, accusing <span class="companylink">General Motors</span> of planning to relocate those lost Canadian jobs to Mexican plants.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He wasn't saying that Canada should build a wall with Mexico — at least not yet — but if Trump was listening to the Canadian union leader slam GM on Tuesday, he would probably have sympathized.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dias says his fight against the GM plant closure is just beginning. So too may be the stirrings of Trump-style populism — unleashed by this decision — be only now starting to unfold in the Canadian political universe. Like Trump himself, the end result is unpredictable.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Organizer James Robson with the Canada Action Coalition says his group — which picketed a speech by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau last Thursday — plans to show up every time a federal cabinet minister does because it's important Canadians see the "pain" caused by low oil prices blamed on insufficient pipeline access to markets.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Inside, during a speech to the Calgary Chamber of Commerce, Morneau said Ottawa has shown its support of western Canadian energy workers by buying the Trans Mountain pipeline for $4.5 billion and continuing to try to get its expansion project built after a court overturned its regulatory approval in August.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He conceded that the "industry is under threat" and said he is sympathetic to the "extreme anxiety" Albertans are feeling but added policies unveiled in his fiscal update last week will help encourage investment in the country.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He dodged questions about whether the federal government will contribute to an Alberta plan to buy railcars to transport oil to market, noting he is willing to listen to short-term solutions but repeating that the Trans Mountain expansion is the best long-term answer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Robson said his organization wants the government to rethink its Bill C-69 to revamp the <span class="companylink">National Energy Board</span> and Bill C-48 to ban oil tankers on the northern coast of British Columbia, noting both make building pipelines more difficult.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Both proposals have been passed in the House of Commons and are being considered in the Senate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There needs to be people associated with the pain that's going on," Robson said of the protests.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It obviously isn't resonating from a high-level conversation so it needs to be grassroots. It needs to be real and they need to see it."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Morneau told reporters he doesn't think the protesters are mistaken.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"They're not wrong at all, they're feeling extreme anxiety which we completely understand," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The industry is under threat, we're not getting market prices for our resources and as a result people aren't making the kinds of investments we want them to make."</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It’s not too soon to start preparing for the next economic downturn.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Shrink your debts, build savings and avoid new entanglements that will place additional strain on your finances. Plan for weak stock markets, squishy housing and stingy pay raises. The end of this boom is coming and it might happen as soon as 2019.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In many parts of the world, there’s a sense of uncertainty about whether economic growth has peaked. The United States is going strong for now. But low oil prices are a negative for a Canadian economy that has been growing at a respectable rate, and output actually shrank in both Japan and Germany in the three months ended Sept. 30. China also shows signs of a slowdown.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The unemployment rate in Canada remains quite low at 5.8 per cent, but the level of growth in earnings and wages in no way suggests a hot labour market. A firm called <span class="companylink">Capital Economics</span> sized up the latest trends in income and advanced the theory that growth has already peaked. Hourly earnings growth came in at 2.2 per cent in October, compared to a 3.9-per-cent increase in May.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Judge your wage increases by how they stack up against the rising cost of living. The inflation rate in October was 2.4 per cent, which means the typical household is falling a bit behind.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The stock market’s performance this fall suggests a realization by investors that we’ve seen the best already for economic growth and corporate profits, even if interest rates in some countries continue to rise. The S&P/TSX Composite Index lost 5 per cent for the year through Oct. 30, and that’s with dividends included. The S&P 500 eked out a 3-per-cent gain over that same period when measured in U.S. dollars, a far cry from the annualized 11.5-per-cent gains of the past three years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The housing markets in the country that qualify as hot this fall are Ottawa and Montreal, both of which are late bloomers, and some of the cities outside Toronto. The average resale price in Toronto rose 2.6 per cent in October on a year-over-year basis, but it’s well down from spring 2017 levels. Vancouver home sales fell 35 per cent in October, although prices were a tick higher. In Alberta, Saskatchewan and Eastern Canada, prices are generally weakening.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Three big wealth drivers in your life are your investments, your house (if you own one) and your paycheque. All three could falter when the economy next slows down.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We’ve not seen the likes of this in ages. Remember, the 2008-09 recession was a fairly mild one for most Canadians. Wage growth has been consistently disappointing for the most part, but we’ve had good stock-market gains for globally diversified portfolios and a stellar housing market in many cities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A four-part survival plan for tough times ahead:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">* Don’t sweat a down market for housing: Declines from the peak value of your home are painful to see but meaningless if you stay put, pay down your mortgage and wait for the next upturn. Housing wealth is overblown, anyway. It can’t do much for you unless you sell in an expensive market and move somewhere much cheaper.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">* Build savings: The best high-rate savings accounts are edging toward the mid-2-per-cent range, which puts you just ahead of inflation. If you see any risk to your job or income, pad your savings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">* Shrink debt: Decreasing your monthly debt payments is the no-fail way to increase your financial flexibility.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">* Buy stocks: Buying stocks when they are beaten down is a great way to position yourself for long-term gains. Buying hot stocks at a market peak feels smart, but it’s not.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The best financial move right now might be to hold off on big purchases that take you into a higher league of spending. Examples: A more expensive car with higher monthly payments, a bigger house with higher mortgage payments or a renovation that triggers a big monthly payment on your line of credit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Stay nimble as we head toward the uncertainties ahead. We may yet see more from housing, stocks and the economy, but winter is coming.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For months, much of the focus on Alberta’s oil-price woes has centred on Western Canadian Select.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That’s understandable because heavy oil accounts for about half of Canada’s crude production, and WCS is the heavy-oil benchmark. Earlier this month, it plunged to a record low of less than US$14 a barrel, and currently sits around US$19.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But what about the other half of production? The situation is likewise grim.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Two lighter oil benchmarks, used in pricing about 40 per cent of Canada’s crude production, have dropped precipitously over the past three months to less than US$30 a barrel. Those benchmarks – Edmonton Mixed Sweet and Synthetic Crude – now sell at steep discounts to U.S. crude, a sign that no corner of Alberta’s oil industry is untouched by pricing challenges.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Discounts for WCS are standard, owing in part to costs associated with moving and refining Canada’s heavy crude. Over the past decade, WCS has sold for an average of US$17 cheaper than West Texas intermediate, the U.S. benchmark, on a per-barrel basis. This fall, the differential ballooned to a record of around US$50.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Differentials are slimmer for Edmonton Mixed Sweet and Synthetic Crude, and the latter has often sold for a premium to WTI. Both are lighter grades than WCS and cheaper to refine.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But over recent weeks, unprecedented price gaps have opened up, despite those grades having “comparable quality profiles” to WTI, as a recent TD Economics report put it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prior to the latest downturn, the largest differential for Synthetic Crude was US$23 a barrel, according to Bloomberg data going back to 2006; on Nov. 1, it was a record US$34 cheaper.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Before 2018, the average price gap for Edmonton Mixed Sweet was about US$4 a barrel, in Bloomberg data going back to mid-2014. It hit a record discount of US$39 this month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Canada’s lighter grades are getting slammed by the same forces affecting heavy crude – namely, a pipeline bottleneck that’s made it tougher to ship product, along with refinery outages during maintenance season in the U.S. Midwest. As a result, an increasing amount of crude is being transported by rail and truck. Some executives in the oil patch have also called on the Alberta government to intervene and impose production cuts, aimed at bolstering prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fortunately, some of the factors weighing on Canadian crude are temporary, and price differentials should continue to improve, TD said on Friday. For one, the group notes that refinery operations are getting back to normal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lighter grades “should see a speedier normalization pattern” next year, TD economists Omar Abdelrahman and Brian DePratto wrote, noting they “are generally easier to flow through pipelines” than heavy crude and “have lower transportation costs.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Historically, WCS spreads have been far more volatile and are far more likely to surge than those of synthetic or light crudes, implying that its normalization path should be subject to more risk than the two lighter oil benchmarks.”</p>

<span class="companylink">TransCanada Corp</span>. is asking a federal judge in Montana to authorize early work on its $8 billion (U.S.) Keystone XL oil pipeline even as the decade-long project faces outstanding legal challenges.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Calgary-based company has asked U.S. District Judge Brian Morris to clarify or amend his ruling earlier this month to say the current injunction doesn't apply to pre-construction activities, spokesman Terry Cunha said in an email. That work would allow <span class="companylink">TransCanada</span> to start construction as early as mid-February, he said.</p>

A year-long setback would cost the company $949 million in earnings and put off the hiring of about 6,600 workers, according to <span class="companylink">TransCanada</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Associated Press reported earlier that <span class="companylink">TransCanada</span> had sent a written statement to the court requesting clarification or an amendment to the injunction. The company declined to release a copy of the filing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 1,900-kilometer pipeline, which would help carry 830,000 barrels of crude a day from Alberta's oil sands to U.S. Gulf Coast refiners, has faced legal holdups amid staunch opposition from environmental groups and landowners. <span class="companylink">TransCanada</span> has yet to formally declare that it will build the conduit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Environmental Assessment</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Earlier this month, Morris found that the project's 2014 environmental assessment by the Obama administration was inadequate. President Donald Trump used that review in a March 2017 decision allowing the project to proceed. Now, the government must consider oil prices, greenhouse-gas emissions and formulate a new spill-response strategy before allowing the pipeline to move forward, Morris wrote in the ruling.</p>

If you’re part of the majority, you should think about buying portfolios rather than individual stocks. Funds provide just such a package and fund investors naturally focus on the performance of their funds rather than on the securities their funds own.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For instance, you can invest in the Canadian stock market by buying the <span class="companylink">iShares Core S&P/TSX Capped Composite Index ETF</span> (XIC). The exchange-traded fund has a low annual fee (management expense ratio) of 0.06 per cent. It is a good proxy for the S&P/TSX Composite Index, which follows about 250 of the largest stocks in Canada.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Canadian stock market provides a timely example because it isn’t doing well this year. The iShares ETF fell 2.9 per cent from the start of January to the close of Nov. 8, according to Morningstar.ca[http://morningstar.ca/] .</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the performance of most of the stocks in the index was more alarming. Half of the stocks in the index saw their prices fall by more than 9 per cent over the same period, 14 stocks fell by more than 40 per cent and five fell by more than 50 per cent.

</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ask Globe Investor</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Question: I have noticed that a lot of the stocks making new lows on the TSX have been preferred shares. Why are preferreds getting hit so hard?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Answer: First, let’s put the decline into perspective.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since Oct. 1, the S&P/TSX Preferred Share Index has skidded by about 9 per cent (excluding dividends). That’s a hefty drop for sure, but for the three years ended Sept. 30, the index posted a cumulative total return (including dividends) of 32.8 per cent. So preferred shares have only given up a portion of the gains they recorded over the past few years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Why the recent weakness? Well, the preferred share market nowadays is dominated by rate-reset preferreds, whose dividends are adjusted every five years at a spread over the five-year <span class="companylink">Government of Canada</span> bond yield. Rate-reset preferreds tend to do well when interest rates are rising (in anticipation that dividends will reset at higher levels) and do poorly when rates are falling (in anticipation of dividend cuts).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Back in 2015, for instance, when the five-year Canada yield languished below 1 per cent for most of the year, many rate-reset preferred shares cut their dividends and the index posted a total return of negative 15 per cent. But as the five-year yield moved higher over the next few years, the index rebounded, producing solid gains for preferred share investors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now, with the global economy showing signs of slowing, what’s happened is that interest rate expectations have moderated. The five-year Canada yield has slipped to about 2.29 per cent, down from about 2.47 per cent two weeks ago. That’s a significant drop in a short period of time, and it was enough to rattle the preferred share market, which is thinly traded and dominated by retail investors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
James Hymas, who manages a preferred share fund and writes the PrefLetter, said the recent drop may have been exacerbated by tax-loss selling, in which investors dump losing stocks in order to offset capital gains on their winners.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“There’s also a certain amount of ‘fighting the last war’ syndrome,” Mr. Hymas said in an e-mail. “People remember what happened the last couple of times the <span class="companylink">Bank of Canada</span> cut its [benchmark] rate (January 2015, especially) and are terrified it will happen again.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite those fears, after the recent drop many preferred shares now offer even more attractive yields. That’s especially true considering that preferred shares, unlike corporate bonds, qualify for the dividend tax credit. What’s more, assuming the five-year Canada yield stays roughly where it is, most preferreds will actually raise their dividends – not lower them – on the next reset date, Mr. Hymas said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“My advice to current holders of preferreds remains the same as it was during the credit crunch: Shut up and clip your coupons,” he said.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Alberta has pledged to impose cleanup timelines on energy companies in a major policy shift to reduce growing financial and environmental risks tied to tens of thousands of idled oil and gas wells across the province.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Energy Minister Margaret McCuaig-Boyd said on Monday she has also told the Alberta Energy Regulator to beef up oversight of energy companies’ financial health. But she stopped short of committing to legislative changes that would give the provincial regulator greater powers over corporate takeovers where the buyer has insufficient funds to meet cleanup obligations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We absolutely are looking at targets and timelines" to ensure companies meet their cleanup obligations, she said in an interview. “Because for too long, operators were allowed to just punt these things down the road until the point there were no operators left to be responsible for them.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The commitment comes after a six-month Globe and Mail investigation published this weekend that revealed about 20 per cent of all oil and gas wells in British Columbia, Alberta and Saskatchewan are inactive, and that there are 54,147 more idle wells in those three provinces than there were in 2005. Such wells no longer produce oil and gas, but have not been plugged.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another 84,569 wells have been abandoned[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/canada/article-oil-patch-fails-to-clean-up-growing-stockpile-of-abandoned-wells/] , many of them for decades. Those wells have been filled with cement and capped because there is no profit left in them, but companies have not yet reclaimed the sites and restored the surrounding land to its original state.</p>

</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Globe investigation also detailed a brisk trade in distressed wells and other facilities, in which major companies routinely offload properties saddled with hefty cleanup obligations onto smaller players with scant ability to pay for remediation. The deals were approved even in cases where purchasers didn’t meet the Alberta regulator’s test for financial fitness.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The deal-making has flourished since oil prices crashed in 2014, aggravating concerns over unfunded liabilities as a string of corporate bankruptcies punted hundreds of millions of dollars in cleanup costs onto the wider industry and the public.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Neither Saskatchewan Energy Minister Bronwyn Eyre nor B.C. Energy Minister Michelle Mungall were available for an interview by deadline on Monday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last year, Alberta’s NDP government loaned the industry $235-million to accelerate cleanup of defunct wells. Such wells have no solvent operator; their number in Alberta alone has swelled to 4,349, up from 545 in 2014. Ms. McCuaig-Boyd said the provincial loan has accelerated cleanup of more than 2,400 wells while creating 1,600 jobs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Alberta’s pledge to tighten cleanup regulations risks antagonizing an industry beset by weak prices. Some of the sector’s biggest companies have called for government relief to address export bottlenecks that have led to steep discounts on much of the province’s heavy oil.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The province has asked Ottawa to subsidize the purchase of rail cars to transport oil under a three-year plan estimated to cost about $3-billion. Meanwhile, a supply glut and low prices have stung Western Canada’s natural gas industry.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. McCuaig-Boyd would not say when the province would introduce cleanup timelines, but the commitment comes amid a wider policy review to address the glut of dormant wells and future industry liabilities the provincial regulator has pegged as high as $260-billion. That review was supposed to be completed by the end of 2017.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She said she has directed the Alberta Energy Regulator (AER) to improve mechanisms to assess company’s finances to stop major companies offloading cleanup obligations. But she blamed successive provincial governments for failing to address mounting liabilities tied to unprofitable wells and other infrastructure.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“They’ve allowed it to grow over a number of years," she said. "That’s why this isn’t a simple solution and we need to take the time to make sure we’re closing the loopholes that we need to and, really, monitoring corporate health is one of the biggies, so companies aren’t allowed to continue to do this.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are several stark differences between how regulators in Western Canada and the United States manage idle wells and the transfer of energy assets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Alberta, Saskatchewan and B.C. focus on a company’s asset-to-liability ratio when determining whether to allow a firm to acquire energy assets. So do many states, such as North Dakota, Nevada and Pennsylvania, but they also look at the company’s debt and the amount of inactive wells involved in the transfer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Security-deposit rules also differ. States such as California and Texas require security bonds from all producers, while Alberta, Saskatchewan and B.C. only request deposits from firms that fall below their financial stress tests.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many U.S. states require companies to seek continuing approvals and post security bonds to keep wells inactive. In some cases, they have to show evidence that the wells could be returned to production, if commodity prices improve. Alabama and Nevada require operators to put a well back into production or begin cleaning it up within two years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">University of Calgary economics associate professor Lucija Muehlenbachs has studied Alberta’s inactive wells. Her predictive modelling, released last year, showed that most of the province’s idle wells would remain dormant even if oil prices rose an astronomical 200 per cent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The AER, itself, found that less than 0.1 per cent of wells that had been idle for more than 10 years were brought back online in 2016 and 2017.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The longer a well is inactive it is even less likely to be reactivated,” Ms. Muehlenbachs said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“It is troubling when I read about 122,000 inactive wells,” she added. “What is the loss of the land? What is the methane emissions from these inactive wells? What’s the water contamination risks?”</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The GM impact</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">General Motors Co</span>. may not have the manufacturing oomph it once had, but the shutdown of its Oshawa assembly plant will ripple through the economy, nonetheless.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists estimate a modest hit to economic growth and a blow to middle- and higher-income jobs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To recap, GM announced Monday it plans to close three assembly operations in Oshawa, Ont., Detroit and Warren, Ohio, along with two propulsion operations in the U.S. as it shifts its focus and saves an expected US$6-billion by the end of 2020.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Almost 3,000 Oshawa workers are affected.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This follows, of course, the huge financial crisis-era bailout of GM by Canadian and U.S. governments that left Canada with about $3.5-billion in losses on the rescue.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It’s true that aid meant some auto jobs could survive for another decade, though it must rankle many who see GM saying thanks and goodbye. Or, as the auto maker phrased it in its announcement, you’re unallocated.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The company has dwindled in Canada since its heyday, but the impact will still be felt.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“It’s a vote by one major company voting on the side of reducing operations in Canada instead of expanding,” said CIBC World Markets chief economist Avery Shenfeld.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Here’s a look at the impact:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">PRODUCTION</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">About 6 per cent of autos manufactured in Canada are assembled in Oshawa, a hefty decline from 13.5 per cent five years ago, said deputy chief economist Brett House and his colleague at <span class="companylink">Bank of Nova Scotia</span>, economist Juan Manuel Herrera.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That represents a drop to 113,000 vehicles from 317,000, respectively, they added in an e-mail.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">GM had been the biggest auto maker in Canada before the bailout era, but has since been eclipsed by Toyota, <span class="companylink">Fiat Chrysler</span> and <span class="companylink">Ford</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Here’s another telling statistic: GM’s share of overall production in Canada stood at 40 per cent in 2007, and now accounts for just 16 per cent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The shutdown, Mr. Herrera added in an interview, is because of shifting consumer tastes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“In the case of the Oshawa plant, I wouldn’t put it specifically to the Canadian auto sector,” he said. “I think this is more of a consumer preference issue.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That’s because the sedans produced in Oshawa are out of favour, supplanted by crossovers or sport utility vehicles.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Do not forget that Oshawa primarily produces passenger cars in a light truck world,” added auto consultant Dennis DesRosier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“It wasn’t that long ago that about 50 per cent of sales were cars, but now they barely make up 30 per cent of new vehicle sales. This means car plants close.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As CIBC’s Mr. Shenfeld noted, Canada has lost market share in autos to Mexcio, Asia and the U.S. itself.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“In the U.S., they’ve been closing in areas like Michigan and opening in the non-union south,” Mr. Shenfeld said. “We’ve just been closing.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And that, he added, is a “bad omen” for a country desperate to expand its exports.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The announcement is a tough pill to swallow given the Oshawa plant’s symbolic status and longstanding ties to the local community,” <span class="companylink">Bank of Montreal</span> economists said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“However, the plant’s position in the pantheon of Canadian assemblies has long since been surpassed by its competitors,” chief economist Douglas Porter and his colleagues Benjamin Reitzes, Alex Koustas and Robert Kavcic added in their report.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“In fact, the Oshawa plant produced the fewest units in Canada over the past year among the nation’s eight assembly plants, and that’s including the final finishing and painting of mostly assembled pickups from the U.S.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Canadian auto production has suffered “a long-term decline,” the <span class="companylink">BMO</span> economists noted, but that’s not equal across the industry.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">GM production in Canada has plunged 59 per cent since peaking in 2004, and has tumbled 45 per cent from its post-crisis high of 2012, <span class="companylink">BMO</span> said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“For context, that amounts to a staggering 570,000 units displaced since 2004 and a hefty 290,000-unit decline since 2012,” the <span class="companylink">BMO</span> economists said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The trend has been much more stable and, in some cases, positive for other manufacturers in the context of the current cycle.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">THE ECONOMY</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The overall vehicle and auto parts industries account for about 2.4 per cent of Ontario’s gross domestic product, and the Oshawa plant alone about 0.15 per cent, noted Scotiabank’s Mr. House and Mr. Herrera.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Royal Bank of Canada chief economist Craig Wright estimated the shutdown would shave about half a percentage point off Ontario’s annual economic growth, largely in 2020. The hit to overall Canadian growth should be shy of 0.2 of a percentage point, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Obviously, incredibly unfortunate news for those directly affected by the news, and for Oshawa, as well,” Mr. Wright said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There’s a ripple effect here, of course, given what goes into a car and the post-production delivery chain.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Consider, for example, that GM’s St. Catharines engine plant is a supplier to Oshawa, Scotiabank’s Mr. Herrera noted. Then there are dealers and others involved in delivery.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“From a regional perspective, the impact will fall squarely on Ontario, as the auto sector plays a significant role in the province’s economy,” the <span class="companylink">BMO</span> economists said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Directly, auto and parts manufacturing accounts for 2.3 per cent of GDP, but accounting for various indirect effects (think transportation, housing, local retailers, etc.) could bump the real world impact to 5 per cent to 10 per cent of the provincial economy.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of course, the auto share of the provincial economy has recovered just about half of the drop it suffered during the crisis and recession, so it now represents “only about half the weight it did less than 20 years ago,” Mr. Porter and his colleagues said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">THE RIPPLES</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As Mr. Herrera put it, you don’t have the money to spend if you’re out of a job, and that’s going to ripple through the community.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Indeed, <span class="companylink">BMO</span> said, the GM shutdown would represent more than 2 per cent of the industry’s employment, though just 0.02 per cent of total employment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But “the income hit looks to be a bit more impactful, as the job losses consist of solid middle-income earners,” the <span class="companylink">BMO</span> economists said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We estimate the income losses will be around $300-million annually.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That’s based on the industry’s so-called multiplier effect, which suggests about four times the impact per job.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Then there’s the emotional side of it all.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“While the impact on the Ontario economy will likely be contained over all, the longer-term symbolism of this move is significant,” the <span class="companylink">BMO</span> economists said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“That is, Ontario continues to gradually shift away from basic manufacturing toward higher valued-added production/research (true, even within the auto industry itself) and into professional services, a trend that began to unfold at the start of the 2000s and then accelerated through the financial crisis.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Where GM itself is concerned, Mr. DesRosier noted the auto maker said it was suffering from the Trump administration’s tariffs, but it would take no action until the midterm elections were done.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“It is now past the elections, and they are taking action,” he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Partial blame for this goes to Trump and his isolationist policies; this is much bigger than U.S. politics, but it certainly is part of the issue.”</p>

</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">VANCOUVER, British Columbia, Nov. 27, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- <span class="companylink">Gen III Oil Corporation</span> (“Gen III” or the “Company”) (TSX-V: GIII) (OTCQX: ISRJF) is providing the following near-term milestones guidance:</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Project Level Debt. The Company’s wholly-owned subsidiary, Gen III Oil (Alberta) Inc. (“Gen III Alberta”) received a senior credit facility term sheet from <span class="companylink">Export Development Canada</span> (“EDC”), a financial Crown corporation, for a term loan for up to $72 million (the “Senior Credit Facility”) to finance up to 50% of our base oil re-refinery in Bowden, Alberta (the “Project”). This financing is non-dilutive to shareholders of the public Company. With EDC offering credit to Gen III Alberta against capital previously expended, we believe our current financing ratio is 55% debt to 45% equity. This ratio will continue to evolve.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Project Level Equity. Management and the Board of Directors decided earlier this year the goal of project financing was to minimize/eliminate dilution to shareholders of the public Company. We are actively working with private equity, family offices and strategic partners to finance the Project at the Gen III Alberta level.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Non-Brokered Private Placement (“NBPP”). The Company is in dialogue with a number of parties to ensure the second tranche of its NBPP is strategically placed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">FEED Study. Front-End Engineering and Design (“FEED”) study is nearing completion. We anticipate the FEED Study will be delivered to the Company in late Q4 2018.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Project Costing. Construction capex is estimated at $89.4 million and we have added a 22% margin for inflation, engineering/construction variables, carrying costs and G&A, resulting in a total Project capex of $119 million. A thorough review of the ongoing FEED study is being undertaken by our Engineering, Procurement and Construction (“EPC”) contractor, PCL Industrial Management Inc. (“PCL”). The Company anticipates securing an updated, fixed Project price from PCL in late Q4, 2018.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Feedstock. Senior management of the Company attended the NORA conference in early November, 2018. NORA membership includes all major participants in the used motor oil (“UMO”) collection and re-refining sectors. As a direct result of meetings held during the NORA conference, the Company is currently engaged in UMO supply negotiations with several of the largest collectors and re-refiners in North America.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Site Demolition. Tendering for site demolition is complete. The Company is finalizing its review of the submissions and we expect to make an award announcement shortly.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Project Commissioning. The targeted commissioning of the Project is Q1 2020.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Forward Looking Financial Projections. Based on the Bowden plant running for 330 days/annum; a 60/40 debt-to-equity ratio; using actual market contracted prices for Group II and Group III secured in Q3, 2018; and the Company’s financial model, we anticipate generating approximately $170 million in gross revenues and EBITDA of $85 million in our first full year of plant operations, subsequent to nameplate commissioning. EBITDA is a non-GAAP measure.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Future Facilities, Joint Ventures and Licensing of IP. The Company is actively engaged in discussions with parties in the USA and Europe for additional re-refining projects.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The major policy shift[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/canada/article-alberta-vows-to-impose-oil-gas-well-cleanup-timelines-on-energy/] comes after a Globe investigation that detailed the environmental and financial risks tied to a surging number of idled oil and gas wells. Data show there are 122,456 inactive sites in B.C., Alberta and Saskatchewan, while another 84,569 wells have been abandoned as companies put off the cost of remediation. (for subscribers)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Alberta’s Energy Minister said she has also told the provincial regulatory body to beef up oversight of energy companies’ financial health. The Globe reported that major firms often offload wells requiring major cleanup onto smaller players who are increasingly at risk of failing, which could punt costs to the public. Alberta isn’t committing to giving the regulator greater powers over corporate takeovers where the buyer has insufficient funds for cleanups.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The RCMP have been probing former Liberal MP Raj Grewal’s gambling for months</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The force has been closely analyzing millions of dollars in transactions[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/politics/article-rcmp-probed-former-liberal-mp-raj-grewals-gambling-for-months/] , including at a casino near Parliament Hill, and occasionally tracking his movements, federal sources say. Grewal is said to have spent millions at casinos over the past three years. He resigned last week from the Liberal caucus and his seat of Brampton East, actions which caught many by surprise given his recent nomination to run for a second term in the next federal election. But sources say there’s been a growing interest by law-enforcement authorities into Grewal’s gambling activities. Upon his resignation, the Prime Minister’s Office said Grewal had a gambling problem and had accumulated “significant personal debt.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">GM’s Oshawa plant shutdown: The key takeaways</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Almost 3,000 people will lose their jobs[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/business/article-gm-to-shut-oshawa-plant-slash-thousands-of-jobs-in-bid-to-cut/] at the plant just east of Toronto by December of 2019 (for subscribers). GM blamed the decision, which also ends production at four U.S. factories, on changing consumer demand. The company said it is eliminating older, poorly selling vehicles like the Oshawa-assembled Chevrolet Impala sedan and refocusing on cleaner energy options and automation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The news sparked a walkout by Oshawa employees while union leaders urged the federal and provincial governments to take action to save manufacturing jobs. The latest collective agreement guaranteed production through September, 2020, according to Unifor. But Ontario Premier Doug Ford said he was told by a GM executive that there’s nothing the province can do. “Basically the ship has already left the dock,” Ford said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The move also underscores a number of issues facing the auto industry, Ian McGugan writes[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/investing/markets/inside-the-market/article-gm-plant-closure-in-oshawa-four-others-in-north-america-signal-change/] (for subscribers). For one, consumers are buying cars at a slower rate and driving less than they used to. And while strong economic growth in recent years has kept car sales in good shape in North America, rising interest rates may deter buyers over the next year. Automakers also face enormous development costs for electric vehicles, and even in good times GM has earned only about 8 cents of profit, before taxes, for every dollar of revenue.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Clerk of the House Craig James, who has been suspended from his role as the top administrator of the legislature pending a criminal investigation, says he was the architect[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/canada/british-columbia/article-decision-to-suspend-bc-legislature-officers-wont-be-examined-by/] of “bulletproof” accounting changes that tightened spending controls. James said he helped shape new policies after a 2012 review found the legislature had “significant deficiencies” including sloppy handling of travel expenses. Sergeant-at-Arms Gary Lenz, who has also been suspended, said: “I know I have done nothing wrong. It’s not an issue of anything I have done that’s going to be coming out.”</p>

Canada Post has said it expects delays to continue through the holiday season and into January. The <span class="companylink">Canadian Union of Postal Workers</span> went on strike to fight for better pay and job security, guaranteed hours for rural and suburban carriers and rules to cut down on workplace injuries it says have reached a “crisis” level.

In Europe, London’s FTSE 100, Germany’s DAX and the Paris CAC 40 were down by between 0.2 and 0.3 per cent by about 6 a.m. ET. New York futures were also down. The Canadian dollar was below 75.5 cents.</p>

Justin Trudeau: Environmentalist or oil sands saviour? He can’t be both</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“When then prime minister Stephen Harper yanked Canada from the Kyoto climate accord in 2011, environmentalists labelled him a fossil. Perhaps, but he wasn’t a hypocrite. He knew Canada had zero chance of meeting carbon-reduction targets as long as it remained a resources-based economy, and he was right. Trudeau is promising a greener future, but his enthusiasm for carbon-intensive projects belies that image. Canada is still part of the global warming problem.” –  Eric Reguly [https://www.theglobeandmail.com/business/rob-magazine/article-is-justin-trudeau-a-climate-change-hypocrite/] (for subscribers)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">America is the bad guy now</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“On Sunday, U.S. agents shot canisters of tear gas at migrants attempting to cross the southern border from Tijuana, Mexico. Photographs of women and children crying as they fled clouds of gas now join the disturbing images of migrants in cages, toddlers wailing behind chain-link fences, families separated by armed guards with little hope of reuniting. This chaos, and the mounting pain in the name of the American flag, has made one thing painfully obvious: the United States is on the wrong side of history. That unfortunate truth has become more evident since Donald Trump took the oath of office and steered the country by its worst instincts. The unvarnished bigotry of his campaign and eventually his administration peeled back the thin veneer hiding our ugliest prejudices. We are in very deep, very dark waters.” –  Jared Yates Sexton [https://www.theglobeandmail.com/opinion/article-america-is-the-bad-guy-now/] , associate professor at Georgia Southern University</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A Chinese scientist says he helped produce the world’s first genetically edited babies</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The unverified claim, which has already sparked backlash, would be a major technological milestone. Researcher He Jiankui says he edited embryos[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/world/article-chinese-scientist-provokes-furor-with-claim-of-worlds-first/] , resulting in the birth of twins with a genetic code manipulated to make them less vulnerable to HIV. While altering genetic codes offers the promise of eradicating heritable disease, it also creates the potential to design human beings with biological advantages. China has been at the forefront of genetic advancement, but even many in the country’s scientific community signed a petition of condemnation. “Pandora’s Box has been opened, but we may have a chance to close it before it’s too late,” it reads.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Here’s the view from André Picard[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/opinion/article-has-the-brave-new-world-of-designer-babies-arrived/] : “There is no question that Dr. He’s experiment was cavalier, unethical and potentially illegal. But the technology is changing so quickly that many scientists are taking a ‘if I don’t do it, someone else will’ attitude. The therapeutic and preventive potential for gene editing is enormous. The opportunity for abuse is also significant. We can’t let fear of eugenics stifle scientific progress. We need to find a way to navigate that ethical minefield. We won’t get there with sweeping bans or self-righteous pronouncements, but with tough discussions leading to some form of societal consensus on how “designed” our future designer babies can, or should, be.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MOMENT IN TIME</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Original Penn Station opens in New York</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nov. 27, 1910: When the station opened in November, 1910, it was a temple to transportation. The new New York terminal of the Pennsylvania Railroad Company reflected all the grandest civic impulses of its age: its waiting room modelled after the Baths of Caracalla in Rome, sculpted from travertine and pink granite. Designed by the great New York architects McKim, Mead and White, it was a high point of public architecture in North America. And then, quite quickly, it began to crumble. In 1961, after decades of booming car ownership and the decline of rail travel, news of the end came: the station would be replaced by a new one, a new Madison Square Garden and an office complex. The result was beloved by nobody: subterranean, labyrinthine, fluorescent-lit, reeking of fast food. The architectural historian Vincent Scully captured the change: “One entered the city like a god,” he wrote. "Now one scuttles in like a rat.” Still, the battle over whether to preserve the station spurred the historic preservation movement, in New York and then across North America. The destruction of this temple brought about a reverence for history that remains with us today. – Alex Bozikovic</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The brutal murder and dismemberment of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi, a murder that was apparently ordered by Saudi Arabia's crown prince, means Canada has some decisions to make.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The most obvious one involves a multibillion contract to supply light armoured vehicles to Saudi Arabia, which is waging a merciless war against men, women and children in Yemen.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Should Canada renege on that contract given that the Saudi royals have shown themselves to be a rogue regime that is willing to murder whomever they want whenever they want without fear of consequences?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Canada also has another business arrangement with Saudi Arabia that perhaps we should also consider cancelling.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to the <span class="companylink">National Energy Board (NEB)</span>, Canada imports approximately 80,000 barrels of oil a day from the kingdom, about 12 per cent of our total oil imports.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That amounts to about $2 billion a year that we pay Saudi Arabia for oil that is refined in New Brunswick and consumed mostly in Eastern Canada as gasoline, diesel, or airplane fuel. The Irving refinery in St. John, N.B., counts on Saudi Arabia for 40 per cent of its crude oil.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Maybe we should be calling that oil "dirty oil."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Given that Canada is the fourth largest oil producer in the world and has more than enough oil to supply the whole country, it has long irked western oil producers that while opposition to pipelines and tanker traffic on the West Coast has met with vociferous opposition, oil tankers from Saudi Arabia, Algeria, Nigeria and Norway regularly unload on the East Coast and yet there is not the same outcry.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sure, the oil imported on the East Cast is a lighter, sweeter crude than the tarry diluted bitumen that would be exported from the West Coast.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But given that we might want to think about cutting off Saudi Arabia, which supplies the second highest volume of oil imports after the U.S., because of its mafia-like behaviour, perhaps we should reconsider that Energy East pipeline project <span class="companylink">TransCanada</span> mothballed a few months back.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It looks pretty good right now given that both the Trans Mountain and the Keystone XL pipelines are stalled indefinitely.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If Energy East were to be revived, would opposition in Ontario and</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Quebec be quite so strong if people knew they were making a choice</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">between Canadian oil and Saudi Arabian oil? And what if the tarry diluted bitumen could be upgraded in Alberta so it was less of an environmental threat?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That was a possibility touted by Alberta Premier Rachel Notley last week. Her government pledged to invest</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">$2 billion in partial bitumen upgrading facilities. Six private sector proposals are being looked at and if they come to fruition, the oil moving through the pipelines would be thin enough not to require diluents, which takes up pipeline capacity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With increased pipeline capacity, the current of glut of Alberta oil would be reduced, which could mean higher prices for Alberta bitumen.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of course, all these proposals would take a few years to become reality. But the fact remains: Demand for oil is not going to totally dry up any time soon. Demand will decrease eventually, but oil will still be needed for some years to come so we can have gasoline, diesel, jet fuel and petrochemical feedstock to make all the plastics we use.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Right now, most of the oil Canada produces sells into the United States for about $15 a barrel. At the same time, we are importing oil from places like Saudi Arabia for a much higher price. How does that make any sense?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's also clear that given the upsurge in shale oil production in the U.S., our trusty customer doesn't need our oil as much as it used to. That combined with U.S. President Donald Trump's volatility when it comes to trade could put our oil exports in danger.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There's a lot of uncertainty in the world these days. What better time for Canada to make sure we don't have to depend on anyone else but ourselves when it comes to energy?</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Falling oil and gas prices and the differential between U.S. and Canadian benchmarks is expected to create headwinds for Canada's banks, although some will be affected more than others.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">The Bank of Nova Scotia</span>, which kicks off the earnings parade on Tuesday, and the <span class="companylink">Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce</span>, which reports on Thursday, may have the highest exposure to the sector, according to a new report by RBC analyst Darko Mihelic.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Analysts will not only be looking at each bank's direct exposure to the sector, such as the likelihood that loans to oil and gas producers could sour. They'll also be studying how the possible contagion could spread to other areas of the economy, affecting everything from credit card loans to mortgages to consumer spending.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although the price of U.S.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">benchmark oil has recovered somewhat from 2016 lows, the Canadian energy sector continues to lag, as a lack of pipeline capacity and refinery shutdowns in the United States are forcing Western Canadian producers to accept steep discounts for their oil and gas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The gap between West Texas Intermediate and Western Canadian Select oil widened significantly in the fourth quarter, with WTI declining by 5 per cent while WCS dropped by 44 per cent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile the spread between Canadian natural gas and U.S. natural gas prices has more than doubled, according to the report.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">Toronto-Dominion Bank</span>, which will also announce its results on Thursday, has the lowest exposure to Canadian oil and gas, Mr. Mihelic wrote. The <span class="companylink">Bank of Montreal</span> and National Bank both have large energy-sector loan books but more limited exposure to personal loans in Alberta. <span class="companylink">BMO</span> will report on Dec. 4 and National Bank will follow on Dec. 5. RBC, which reports on Wednesday, was not discussed at length in the report.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We think ‘conservative' provisioning behaviours in Q4 will be rewarded by the market given the recent decline in oil and gas prices/widening differentials," Mr. Mihelic wrote. “However, details matter and it will be quite interesting to see how banks communicate their exposures."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Back in 2016, plummeting energy prices were also the central focus during the banks' earnings calls.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The banks provided helpful disclosure around their oil and gas exposure at the time, Mr. Mihelic said. But given the much larger differential between U.S.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">and Canadian prices and the adoption of new accounting standards, that disclosure is now outdated, he added.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The new International Financial Reporting Standards 9 accounting standard, which was introduced just more than a year ago, puts more emphasis on banks' expected losses over the life of a loan. It is expected to make provisions for credit losses - the money that banks set aside to cover bad loans - more volatile.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“If banks' outlooks are negatively revised to incorporate the potential impact of sustained low oil prices, we expect to see higher provisions for credit losses," the report said.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Before getting into it, let's be clear that Albertans take no joy in other Canadians losing their jobs.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Scores of thousands of energy workers know how it feels. The individual pain is the same, whatever the impact on society at large.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">About 2,500 Ontarians will be unemployed directly, and another 30,000 or so are expected to either be out of work or have their jobs seriously affected, because of GM's Oshawa plant closure next year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This is not trivial, especially after the Harper government put in more than $13 billion in 2009 to save GM and <span class="companylink">Chrysler</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since 2015, the Liberals have added another $393 million in incentives to Ontario's auto industry, according to federal Economic Development Minister Navdeep Bains.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That kind of public cash, it appears, will buy you less than 10 years of auto industry loyalty.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Consecutive federal governments have tried their best, both with policy and money, to keep the auto plants viable in vote-rich southern Ontario.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There's always been debate about whether the bailouts were wise. But many other Canadian regions would love to have such instant attention from Ottawa on any pressing problem.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The political and media focus on the closure was overwhelming Monday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nearly every significant political player commented within a couple of hours, with Andrew Sheer, the Conservative leader, even implying he'd be willing to cough up more money. The CBC gave it full national-crisis treatment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Albertans often ask themselves how Ottawa would react if our provincial crisis suddenly hit Ontario. Reporters and politicians would probably collapse, frothing in hysteria.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By some estimates, more than 40,000 workers lost their jobs after the 2014 oil price crash began. Up to 100,000 people may have lost direct and related work in Alberta and other provinces.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The losses were spread over many companies. Unlike the auto workers, nobody got a year's notice before layoffs actually began. It was put down tools or pack up the briefcase, and out the door you go.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Because Alberta's layoffs were so general, the media attention was less intense. Certainly, there were no teams of national reporters waiting for workers at the gates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ontario has 14.1 million people. Alberta's population is 4.2 million. This province suffered a much larger hit across a far smaller population.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Calgary's downtown office towers were hollowed out. The vacancy rate in a once-booming sector is now 28 per cent. The city's towers have lost $12.6 billion in assessed value since 2015.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This has shifted the property tax burden in a city of 1.4 million to near and outer suburbs. The city has subsidized the tax hikes but that can't go on. Businesses of all kinds face a serious threat for years to come.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Oshawa, a city of 170,000, will certainly face similar pain. But it's unlikely that the whole Greater Toronto Area (6.4 million) will feel more than a ripple from the GM closure.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since Albertans own oil and gas in a general constitutional way, the provincial treasury was also slammed with a massive cut in royalty payments from companies, a crisis that's deepening even now with the disastrous price differential.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ontario doesn't face that problem. The province will lose corporate and personal tax revenues because of the GM closure, but Alberta has seen lower tax revenues too, on a much larger scale.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When Prime Minister Justin Trudeau came to Calgary last week, he offered no help for the massive gap between world prices and the cost of Alberta oil.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He and his ministers constantly point out that they already bought the Trans Mountain pipeline project, as well as <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span>'s other assets, for $4.5 billion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That's all we get, but so far it's been a dud for Alberta. There's no guarantee the expansion project will even be built.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Ottawa has earned $70 million in revenue from the existing pipeline in just a few months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If you're counting money in Ottawa, that must sound pretty good.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Alberta, it doesn't mean a thing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Oshawa, our sympathies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We really do feel your pain.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">You have to give Justin Trudeau credit for turning up to deliver remarks on his energy policies in Calgary, where he's made himself about as welcome as an expenses claim from Adrienne Clarkson.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since 1972, when Trudeau's father began a string of four consecutive elections without winning a seat in Alberta, the Liberals have elected a grand total of 10 Alberta members of Parliament spread over 14 elections. The four Trudeau won in 2015 tied the 1992 highwater mark in that string. Yet Jean Chrétien, previous holder of that record, grew so oblivious to Albertans he didn't bother to have his plane land there in his final campaign.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The current prime minister seems more likely to match his father's goose-egg than his 2015 tally. But he showed up to take the heat. Give him that.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Less impressive was his response to a suggestion that his government has no concrete plan for dealing with the gap between the price other oil producers get for oil, and the price Alberta gets. Premier Rachel Notley calculates the difference between Canadian and U.S. crude is costing the Canadian economy $80 million a day. The <span class="companylink">Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers</span> figures the loss adds up to $13 billion in the first 10 months of 2018 alone.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Trudeau acknowledged the situation is "very much a crisis." But then, pushed on Ottawa's plans, he delivered a response that seemed to suggest the poor unenlightened locals didn't understand the difficulties he faces.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"You think there's a supersimple easy answer and there's not," he told Chamber of Commerce president Sandip Lalli.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There's a multi-faceted complex issue and as much as there is a tendency out there in the world to give really simple answers to really complex questions, unfortunately the world doesn't work like that," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We need to make sure that we're moving forward in the right way and that is where actually listening to the experts is sort of the best way to make policy."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If the prime minister had been speaking to a Grade 5 class in Ontario, or some other province where oil isn't part of the local lifeblood, his remarks might have made sense. But he was speaking Calgary, centre of the Canadian energy business. It's a fair guess his audience contained quite a few executives who have spent a lifetime finding, extracting and shipping oil and gas. Their job requires a high level of expertise in negotiating the hoops and high jumps set up for them by regulators at various levels of government, which are regularly changed as new figures arrive on the federal and provincial stage.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Just three years ago, the arrival of Notley's New Democrats represented a wrenching change in an industry accustomed to four decades of compliant Tories. That Calgary's oil executives managed it is evidence of their skill set and ability to adapt. To be lectured on the complications of the business by a prime minister who was still giving snowboard lessons when they were dealing with one of the world's most volatile and unpredictable commodities must have seemed a bit rich.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Not to the prime minister, however. One of the things we've learned about Justin Trudeau over his three years in office is that he occasionally slips loose from the official spin to reveal what's actually running through his mind. It's often embarrassing, such as his recent rush from the House of Commons to mock the opposition as "ambulance-chasing politicians" over their demand that child-killer Terri-Lynne McClintic be sent back to prison. (That one looked particularly foolish when his government buckled to public pressure and did exactly as suggested.) Or his belated discovery, when accused of groping a young woman, that men and women can see experiences in different lights.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It seems likely that when Trudeau suggested Lalli couldn't possibly understand the intricacies of the oil business, he believed what he was saying. Because it's very clear that those complexities have come as a revelation to Trudeau himself. Over the past six decades, Liberal governments in Ottawa have made crystal clear how little they understand the energy business. Usually their ignorance has been accompanied by a level of ambivalence that does a lot to explain their continual failure to deal effectively with one of Canada's most crucial industries throughout those years. During his run for office, this prime minister treated the province's long-standing distrust in the same way he handled other challenges: it would all be solved with good fellowship and honest discussions between wellmeaning Canadians.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I understand how energy issues can divide the country," he said in Calgary in 2015." "But I also know that strong leadership can see us through the challenges we face. Not leadership by fiat but leadership that listens, that respects our differences while bringing people together and keeps the door open to new and innovative ideas."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That being the case, wouldn't it make sense for the prime minister to listen to the people in the industry who have decades of firsthand experience when they say that Bill C-69, which is to overhaul the review process for energy projects, will make a bad situation worse, ensuring pipelines and other essential infrastructure become impossible to build? Such is the desperation of the situation that Notley has suggested an emergency fleet of railcars be assembled to transport oil, given the government's inability to get a pipeline built. It's an unlikely plan that would barely count as a stopgap measure, but wouldn't be suggested if the province hadn't lost all faith that Ottawa knows a pipeline plan from a hole in the wall.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Trudeau did sit down with 11 oil and energy executives after his Calgary speech, but Lalli noted that "the sense of urgency was still not there."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Why would it be? The Liberals haven't seen anything urgent in Alberta in 60 years. Who else but a Liberal prime minister could suggest Calgary isn't able to grasp the complexities of the energy business as acutely as the mandarins and aides who advise him in Ottawa?

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CALGARY—The Alberta government is “cracking down” on the province's oil and gas sector by asking the province's industry-funded energy regulator to step up, Energy Minister Margaret McCuaig-Boyd said Monday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Friday, the Star and National Observer published a joint investigation[https://www.thestar.com/news/investigations/2018/11/23/oilsands-waste-is-collected-in-sprawling-toxic-ponds-to-clean-them-up-oil-companies-plan-to-pour-water-on-them.html] that found the oil industry's strategy to deal with a trillion litres of toxic bitumen mining waste — called tailings — is centred on an unproven process. Despite years of promises from public officials that the ponds where the tailings are stored would shrink and go away, they continue to grow and appear to be leaking into the nearby Athabasca River system, the investigation found.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">McCuaig-Boyd declined to comment on the tailings issue in an interview Monday. However, she did blame the looming costs of cleaning up the oilpatch on the previous conservative government, and said she has directed the Alberta Energy Regulator (AER), which is industry-funded, to tighten its rules in key areas to “keep bad actors off the landscape” and ensure “responsible companies are protected.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“It's a problem that's built up over decades,” she said. “It's not an overnight fix but (the AER is) working with us ... We'll be able to report more soon.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Earlier this month, the joint investigation revealed the cost of cleaning up Alberta's oilpatch could be as high as $260 billion. The AER had previously said the cost was just over $58 billion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The joint media report was based on a presentation given by one of the regulator's vice-presidents, released through Freedom-of-Information legislation. The regulator has since said its use of the higher figure, which was calculated by its own experts, was a “mistake” and it stands by the lower figure.</p>

Toxic gas nearly killed this oil worker. His employer never told the province[https://www.thestar.com/news/canada/2017/12/21/toxic-gas-nearly-killed-this-oil-worker-his-employer-never-told-the-province.html]
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The liability estimate factors in the costs of shutting down and cleaning up oil-and-gas sites at the end of their usefulness. That includes inactive wells, pipelines and tailings ponds in the oilsands. So far, companies have only submitted about $1.6 billion in security deposits to cover the cost.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Alberta has also seen an increasing number of inactive wells becoming “orphans” — sites at the end of their useful lives that need to be cleaned up, but no longer have owners who can pay for the job. In recent years, the number of orphan wells designated for abandonment has climbed from fewer than 800 to more than 2,000, according to industry data.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Earlier this year, for instance, Sequoia Resources Ltd. went bankrupt and left the province without decommissioning and cleaning up 4,000 wells, pipelines and other facilities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Monday, the <span class="companylink">Alberta Liberal Party</span> called for the NDP government to create a bond program that would require companies to put up cash for cleanup cost, a measure party leader David Khan said could protect the government from picking up such costs in the event of financial disaster.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Obviously the whole industry is struggling ... but we have to have a higher-level discussion about how to meet these challenges,” Khan said. “It's just not something we can continue to ignore.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Khan compared the idea to the system used in Texas, which successfully adopted such a program in 2002.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We don't have all the specific silver bullet answers, but we want recognition that this is a serious problem and high-level government examination of the situation,” he said. “If we allow companies that are owned by offshore entities to go bankrupt and transfer their liabilities to the public purse or to the rest of the oil and gas industry, it's going to hurt our homegrown oil and gas producers and it could create a huge liability for everyone in the future.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">McCuaig-Boyd said the government has looked at the bond idea and has a variety of measures in the works, though she declined to share details or a timeline.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Canadians shouldn't be on the hook for actions of irresponsible operators,” she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In response to the tailings investigation, United Conservative Party MLA Jason Nixon said liabilities and environmental issues in the oilpatch are “not a new thing” in Alberta.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“It is an issue that needs to be addressed by the government long term for the sustainability of our industry and our province,” he said. “We have to do that at the same time right now as trying to balance an economic crisis and being able to make sure we keep our industry going.”</p>

Despite the pittance he was preparing to pay, negotiations had bogged down. By early August Mr. Wang, who had previously worked at major U.S. investment banks, was firing off an e-mail to Ms. Riddell Rose in which he threatened to put the deal on hold.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After all, the acquisition was not without major risks. Many of the wells were nearing the end of their economic life, and the deal included the assumption of future cleanup costs, pegged by the seller at $133.6-million; Mr. Wang’s company simply did not have the financial wherewithal normally required to convince the Alberta Energy Regulator (AER) that he could afford such a cleanup.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">No matter, as that environmental bill had been glossed over: The deal had been structured in such a way that the AER – an industry-funded agency that operates at arm’s length from the provincial government and is charged with both promoting and policing the oil business – would not be able to assess whether Mr. Wang’s new company could meet the obligations.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What followed was a complex deal that exemplifies the dangers of a brisk trade in high-liability energy assets now confounding governments and their regulators. Within 18 months, Mr. Wang’s company, by then named <span class="companylink">Sequoia Resources Corp</span>., would be insolvent, triggering disputes over how it was allowed to buy up energy properties in the first place – and who would cover the costly cleanup of the wells.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Globe and Mail spent six months poring over court records and delving into thousands of pages of corporate and government documents, obtained via freedom-of-information laws, in an effort to shine a light on a murky corner of the oil and gas business that has flourished through the prolonged slump in commodity prices: the buying and selling of wells and production plants saddled with major environmental liabilities. Along the way, The Globe has also scoured oil- and gas-well databases in British Columbia, Alberta and Saskatchewan, examined several companies’ fiscal reports and public statements and interviewed dozens of industry executives, landowners and bankers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The reporting points to a looming financial and environmental crisis: Of the 610,696 oil and gas wells in those three provinces, some 20 per cent are sitting inactive, according to The Globe’s data. Almost two-thirds of these 122,456 idle wells have been shut off for more than five years. And a growing proportion are owned by companies that can least afford to clean them up – a process known as reclamation – when their commercial life ends. Costs have already overwhelmed dedicated cleanup funds set up by the industry, put a strain on regulators and prompted Alberta’s NDP government to step in with hundreds of millions of dollars in loans.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Glossary</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">* Active A well that is producing oil and gas</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">* Inactive A well that is not producing oil and gas and has not been plugged</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">* Plugged The well has been filled with cement and its wellhead has been removed and capped. This type of well is also known as abandoned</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">* Reclaimed The well site has been returned to its original state and a reclamation certificate has been issued</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">* Orphaned The well has no owner because the owner is bankrupt. The well and its cleanup costs have been transferred to an orphan well fund</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Through the middle of the past decade, natural gas was Canada’s economic trump card. Tight U.S. supplies pushed up prices, providing incentives for companies to tap even small, shallow reserves across the Prairies. The upshot: a drilling boom that sent profits soaring – and royalties gushing into provincial budgets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But then came the shale-gas fracking revolution, which allowed the U.S. industry to access massive reserves near major population centres. Early this month, Alberta gas was selling for less than $2 a unit. That’s one-sixth what it fetched at the market peak in 2005 – and even less than the $3 and change it got in 2014. This past summer gas traded, at times, for negative values.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Medicine Hat, Alta., is struggling with the new market reality. Some wells in the city date back more than a century. Over the years, the city itself had become an active gas driller, padding the municipal budget with large dividends.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But today drillers are largely bypassing this corner of Alberta. New investment is more likely to come from an altogether different sector: On a 71-acre spread near the city’s outskirts sits the makings of <span class="companylink">Aurora Cannabis Inc</span>.’s massive greenhouse. The civic moniker, “The Gas City,” feels distinctly out of date. “We haven’t seen new gas drilling for a long, long time down here,” said Brad Maynes, manager of the municipal energy division.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Across the Prairies, the prolonged downturn in prices has aggravated concerns, as inactive wells – and their future cleanup costs – languish on the books of Perpetual, Husky, Enerplus and others. As wells age and production declines, such obligations are like pension funds faced with growing payouts as beneficiaries retire, says Jeremy McCrea, an analyst at <span class="companylink">Raymond James Ltd</span>. in Calgary.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, costs such as maintenance, lease payments to landowners and municipal taxes remain elevated, even as production falls. None of which pleases investors. “Companies with higher abandonment liabilities trade at a bigger discount than their peers,” Mr. McCrea noted.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Keith Wilson, an Edmonton-based lawyer who represents landowners in disputes with energy companies, is blunt. “The commerce of the business is to take high-value producing wells, produce them as much as you can, and then, as soon as the economics become marginal, hand them off to someone else and include the liability within it,” he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Along with those liabilities have come growing risks for governments, as companies with weak finances have snapped up money-losing wells in an ill-advised roll of the dice on natural-gas prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the case of Sequoia, e-mail correspondence shows that executives repeatedly assured AER staff that the company had a plan to arrest financial losses inherited from Perpetual, even as Sequoia snapped up distressed assets from Waldron and another bankrupt energy producer, Endurance Energy Ltd. The AER has said it did not collect security deposits – typically required in transfers of wells to financially precarious producers – in several of the deals.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Then, in June of 2017, Sequoia Resources bought natural-gas assets that were burdened with $22.8-million in associated liabilities from <span class="companylink">Husky Energy</span>. As part of the deal, Husky gave Sequoia $6.5-million, with half of that held in escrow to help pay for well cleanup over two years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Two months later, Sequoia’s Mr. Wang and Mr. Yang agreed to acquire another 2,644 wells from Husky, with liabilities of $135-million. Almost 50 per cent of the wells were inactive, according to documents filed with the regulator outlining the purchase. This time around, the buyer was not Sequoia Resources but Sequoia Operating Corp., a related company run by the same management and from the same office.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sequoia Operating, which now goes by the name AlphaBow Energy, also picked up assets at bargain prices from OMERS Energy, Superman Resources and debt-saddled <span class="companylink">Pengrowth Energy Corp</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Every single deal received the AER’s blessing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the deals with Husky, Sequoia’s principals filed what’s known as a discretionary-approval request form asking the AER to relax rules that were established, in the regulator’s own words, “to protect Albertans from unfunded liabilities.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The paperwork was routine. On Aug. 4, 2017, Vicki Benoit, chief operating officer of Sequoia Operating, wrote to Hélène de Beer, then the AER’s director of closure and liability, outlining plans to buy what she called “low-risk oil and gas wells” from Husky.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By its own math, however, Sequoia’s financial position would deteriorate as a result of the transaction, according to documents it filed with the regulator in support of the asset-transfer process.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For Husky, majority-owned by companies controlled by the family of now-retired Hong Kong billionaire Li Ka-shing, the sales were part of wider efforts to shore up finances bruised by the collapse in oil prices. By late 2017, Husky had shed about $840-million in long-term cleanup obligations, primarily through asset sales in Western Canada.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Husky spokesman Mel Duvall insists the company takes into account the creditworthiness of purchasers and prevailing market conditions before it sells assets and will include money for cleanup if needed. He would not comment on the specific terms of many of the transactions, but he noted that AlphaBow Energy remains a solvent operator. He said Husky had spent $136-million on well cleanup in 2017, up from $87-million in 2016.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“From our perspective,” he wrote in an e-mail to The Globe, “we see the regulator working at balancing the benefit of maintaining production to support the local economy, generate royalties, taxes and lease payments against the potential risks of transferring assets and liabilities.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Life cycle of an oil and gas well</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The life of an oil or gas well can be long, spanning an average of 20 to 30 years. When a well reaches the end of its production life, it can enter a period of dormancy before finally being abandoned and decommissioned. Abandoning a non-producing well can be an expensive proposition entailing plugging, sealing it with concrete and cleaning up any possible contamination. The final step is restoring the land to its original state.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">1</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Identification and drilling</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After locating an oil or gas deposit and obtaining rights, a drilling rig is brought in to bore a hole to the licensed depth. The wellbore is lined with a steel casing to prevent collapse and groundwater contamination. Drilling mud is pumped continuously to wash out drilling debris.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Play animation</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sequoia’s collapse has cast a critical light on the AER’s ability to gauge financial risk, not least when assets change hands. This year, <span class="companylink">Canadian Natural Resources Ltd</span>. – the oil-and-gas giant chaired by billionaire Murray Edwards – has launched dozens of regulatory appeals and several lawsuits to block deals it says expose the industry to billions of dollars in cleanup costs due to the perceived insufficient funds of buyers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Such costs are borne by the industry cleanup fund; payments are proportional to a company’s liabilities. CNRL’s extensive holdings and sizable backlog of dormant wells effectively mean it foots the largest share of the bill when other players fail.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It argues that current regulations make it too easy to transfer liabilities to thinly financed producers. “Obviously we’re concerned,” said CNRL president Tim McKay. But, he added, the company is “working proactively with the government to enhance the rules.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He would not discuss specifics – whether, for example, companies should be required to post cleanup bonds upfront, before they drill a well. But it’s clear CNRL’s interventions are not limited to Alberta. It has sued Predator Oil BC Ltd. and Ranch Energy Corp. over a complex transaction in B.C.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ranch Energy billed itself as a specialist in buying up and reclaiming aging assets burdened with expensive cleanup obligations. According to affidavits filed as part of the company’s receivership proceedings, it aimed to use cash flow from the production of oil and gas to systematically clean up wells as they petered out. In this case, the cash was also needed to pay off a hefty debt in a related business (providing airplane and helicopter service to the oil industry) for which Ranch was in default.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The acquisition was effectively a flier on gas prices, one that proved tragically optimistic. It was a flawed business plan that also triggered a court battle with Ranch’s lender over what to do with assets carrying tens of millions of dollars in abandonment costs. Ranch’s insolvency now threatens to add to the province’s growing tally of defunct sites.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That number has swelled to 294, up from just 24 in 2014, according to the BC Oil and Gas Commission, the provincial agency that hands out drilling permits and oversees asset transfers between companies. The increase has overwhelmed cleanup funds in B.C. Just $5.3-million was available as of March, 2017, against a total cleanup cost estimated at $40-million to $60-million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Across Western Canada, regulators insist they are paying close attention to who is buying oil and gas wells. This past April – on the heels of a fiscal year in which the BC Oil and Gas Commission says it rejected two of 60 permit-transfer applications, and where nearly a third of the wells in the province are inactive – the B.C. government enacted legislation to increase an industry levy that funds the cleanup of defunct sites. It is also toughening regulations, with the aim of preventing operators with checkered histories from producing oil and gas in the province.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Alberta, the AER is embroiled in a Supreme Court case involving insolvent <span class="companylink">Redwater Energy Corp</span>. At issue is a lower-court ruling, from 2016, that effectively put the interests of secured creditors – including provincially owned <span class="companylink">ATB Financial</span> – to recoup money on soured loans ahead of regulators’ ability to enforce the cleanup of old, unproductive wells when a company goes bust. A decision from the top court is expected soon. Should its appeal fail, the AER has warned of more pressure on an already strained system.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And strained it is: CNRL, lawyers and landowners have all criticized the regulator for lowballing risks. Industrywide, the AER pegs total liabilities at about $58.7-billion. In fact, documents made public by the regulator say the industry’s ultimate cleanup bill for everything from pipelines to tailings pits could swell to $260-billion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Against such risks, the regulator says it has collected about $1.6-billion in security deposits.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, a wider policy review to address the glut of dormant wells and future industry liabilities that was launched by Premier Rachel Notley’s NDP government has stalled after initial consultations. A spokesman for Energy Minister Margaret McCuaig-Boyd said the minister was unavailable for comment. Alberta’s Auditor-General is also studying the issue but is not expected to release findings until after next spring’s general election.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Policymakers in Saskatchewan have floated changes that would require companies to post higher security deposits when transfers involve large numbers of wells facing major cleanup obligations. The provincial Ministry of Energy and Resources has tested the new model and insists it ensures enough money is collected to cover eventual cleanups.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Publicly, at least, even the industry itself says it is on board. “We want to make sure that the participants in the market are willing and able to discharge their end-of-life obligations,” said Brad Herald, vice-president of Western Canada operations for the Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But many likely won’t be able to meet those obligations. In Alberta alone, 45 per cent of producers are in a precarious financial state, according to the regulator’s financial test. These companies account for 28,523 wells. They include SanLing Energy Ltd. and Houston Oil and Gas Ltd.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The problems aren’t going away.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Stretching beneath an immense swath of flat prairie and rolling sand hills, the Shackleton gas field in southwestern Saskatchewan once minted fortunes for investors. In 2002, Husky announced plans to drill 170 wells in the newly discovered shallow-gas reserve. Four years later, a company called Profico Energy Management Ltd. sold its holdings in the region to <span class="companylink">Focus Energy Trust</span> in a $1.2-billion deal. Focus then merged with a forerunner of Enerplus in a transaction worth about $1.4-billion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These days, following a decade of low gas prices, production has slowed to a trickle. Husky and Enerplus have handed off most of their wells to little-known Abbey Resources Corp. The company’s president, Jim Gettis, has conceded he acquired some of the drilling leases for as little as $10, a minuscule sum for assets that once changed hands in billion-dollar deals.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But despite that sweet entry fee, Mr. Gettis says he needs to cut costs if he is to revive the wells and make his business plan work.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At least that’s what he told farmers at a meeting at the Living Sky Casino in Swift Current, Sask., this past April. In his pitch, now posted on <span class="companylink">YouTube</span>, he asks farmers to swallow a 50-per-cent cut in lease payments – which can run between $1,000 and $3,000 a year – for wells on their grain fields. He also outlines plans to ask local municipalities for a tax break. Just before the meeting, he had been proposing to offer shares in Abbey in lieu of annual lease payments, but he scrapped that idea when it became clear it wouldn’t fly with the 100-plus farmers in the casino’s theatre.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Months later, about a dozen farmers gathered for coffee on an early September morning in a former grocery store they chipped in to buy and turned into their hub. And they were still steaming.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After the casino meeting, the company had sent a letter to each farmer stating that Abbey was immediately cutting its lease payment in half – and that cashing the enclosed cheque would signal acceptance of the company’s “rent reduction program.” For those who didn’t accept, their wells “will have to be abandoned,” read the letter, signed by Mr. Gettis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some of those farmers that September morning planned to seek legal advice. Others had cashed the cheques and sent their own letters back, stating they did not agree to the rent-reduction terms and that they expected their contracts to be honoured in full.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Gettis declined to respond to detailed questions from The Globe. In an e-mail, he wrote that “Abbey is a private company and discussing private issues in public at this stage is not in the best interest of Abbey or the stakeholders who continue to benefit. In fact, it would put the recovery plan at risk.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Farmers aren’t the only ones being shortchanged. Instead of paying its full 2017 and 2018 property taxes – totalling more than $3-million – to four regional municipalities and the local school division, Abbey instead tried to cut deals with them. Two municipalities have refused his terms; one has partially agreed, while the other recently accepted.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">All of which, farmers say, raises another question: If Abbey can’t afford its rent and taxes, how can it afford to maintain its wells – and clean them up when they’re no longer productive? And if it can’t do that, why was it allowed to acquire them at all?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The answer, at least in part: A letter of credit – guaranteeing payments of almost $28-million in the event that Abbey fails and can’t clean up its 2,345 wells – has been posted with the Saskatchewan government. But not by Abbey; it didn’t have the funds. Enerplus and Husky committed the security deposit instead, said a spokesperson with the Ministry of Energy and Resources.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That might have helped smooth the way to Abbey assuming custody of the assets – but landowners say it won’t be enough, should Abbey’s plans not pan out, to plug and reclaim all the wells. And there are lots of them: They would nearly sextuple the province’s so-called orphan-well count, currently at 516, unless yet another company were to buy them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“It’s too easy for these people to buy a company or properties,” said farmer Barry Tuchscherer, “and not worry about the liability.” Mr. Tuchscherer knows the Shackleton gas field intimately: He was a lead operator, akin to a foreman, for Enerplus for 15 years. The company was a good employer, he says. It cleaned up many wells that were no longer viable and it paid farmers lease payments in full.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But he thinks the government should collect more money up front from companies when times are good, so that the cash is there for reclamation when a downturn comes along.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Indeed, while many are angry with Abbey, farmer Kelly Bradford’s ire is reserved, in the main, for Enerplus. While taking a Globe reporter on a tour of neglected Shackleton wells, he described Mr. Gettis as a businessman playing the game. “Those wells should have stayed with Enerplus, and they should have used their deep pockets and cleaned it up,” he said, “just like everybody else does in business.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In an interview, Drew Mair, manager of investor relations for Enerplus, said it transferred its Shackleton wells because they were no longer essential to its core business. In any case, he added, Enerplus is not offloading its environmental responsibility; he noted it is reclaiming 600 wells, at its own expense, that Abbey didn’t want.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">From that perspective, Mr. Mair said, “we’re not shirking any responsibility.”</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CALGARY, Alberta, Nov. 26, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- <span class="companylink">Bellatrix Exploration Ltd</span>. (“Bellatrix” or the “Company”) (TSX, NYSE: BXE) announces that it has entered into a definitive agreement to acquire complementary assets within its core Ferrier area of west central Alberta from POSCO Daewoo E&P Canada Corporation (“<span class="companylink">Daewoo</span>”) for total consideration of approximately $9.5 million. Bellatrix also announces updated commodity risk management contracts.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Transaction Highlights</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The acquisition includes approximately 1,250 boe/d (65% natural gas, 35% liquids) of low decline (&lt;15%) current production and represents the consolidation of working interest ownership in existing producing wells and formation rights. The acquisition consolidates 100% of partner assets in the area further simplifying Bellatrix’s business and long-term strategy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The acquisition includes production volumes from 61 gross (19.6 net) producing wells and acreage originally acquired by <span class="companylink">Daewoo International Corporation</span> and Devonian Natural Resources Private Equity Fund (“Devonian”) in 2013, and subsequently jointly developed with Bellatrix. Total consideration of approximately $9.5 million includes $1.75 million in cash and 6.75 million shares of Bellatrix. The transaction has an effective date of September 1, 2018.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The transaction is consistent with Bellatrix's strategy to consolidate operated production and acreage within its core area at attractive metrics. The acquired volumes are expected to be processed through Bellatrix owned and controlled infrastructure and facilities, and as a result, the acquisition is expected to have no incremental impact on general and administrative expenses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Details of the transaction include:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><pre class="articlePre" > 
 Total consideration                   $9.5 million
 
 Estimated current production          1,250 boe/d (65% natural gas, 35% liquids)

</pre>
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Estimated acquisition metrics include:</p>

</pre>
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Note (1): Estimated 2019 net operating income based on prices of $1.66/GJ AECO and US$62.88/bbl WTI.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The asset acquisition will contribute approximately one month of volumes (based on an estimated closing date on or before November 30, 2018) to Bellatrix’s annual results or the equivalent of approximately 100 boe/d, therefore Bellatrix is not amending its 2018 full year production guidance range.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Updated Commodity Price Risk Management Protection and Market Diversification Benefits</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bellatrix’s entered into a series of market diversification contracts approximately one year ago that provide a distinct advantage and benefit from recent North American natural gas price improvement. Bellatrix’s market diversification sales into the Dawn, Chicago and Malin markets represent approximately 55% of Bellatrix’s natural gas volumes (based on the mid-point of 2018 average production guidance). Each of these three markets has demonstrated price improvement in concert with strengthening Henry Hub prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bellatrix has proactively fixed the prices on a portion of these markets to reduce the impact of commodity price volatility on our business. As at November 26, 2018 Bellatrix has locked in fixed prices in December 2018 (approximately 30% of natural gas volumes based on current annual 2018 production guidance at a Canadian equivalent price of approximately $4.33/Mcf) and the first quarter of 2019 (approximately 20% of natural gas volumes at a Canadian equivalent price of approximately $4.20/Mcf) as follows:</p>

More particularly and without limitation, this document contains forward-looking statements concerning the expected impacts of the Daewooo acquisition; the expectation that the acquired volumes will be processed through Bellatrix owned and controlled infrastructure and facilities; the expectation that the acquisition will not have any incremental impact on general and administrative expenses; expectations regarding the production declines associated with the assets; the expected closing date of the acquisition; the expected 2019 net operating income (including the components thereof) and the expected 2019 net operating income multiple associated with the assets acquired. To the extent that any forward-looking information contained herein constitute a financial outlook, they were approved by management as at the date of this press release and are included herein to provide readers with an understanding of the anticipated funds available to Bellatrix to fund its operations and readers are cautioned that the information may not be appropriate for other purposes. Forward-looking statements necessarily involve risks, including, without limitation, risks associated with oil and gas exploration, development, exploitation, production, marketing and transportation, loss of markets, volatility of commodity prices, currency fluctuations, imprecision of reserve estimates, environmental risks, competition from other producers, failure to meet the conditions for closing the acquisition, inability to retain drilling rigs and other services, incorrect assessment of the value of acquisitions, failure to realize the anticipated benefits of acquisitions and dispositions, delays resulting from or inability to obtain required regulatory approvals, actions taken by the Company's lenders that reduce the Company's available credit and ability to access sufficient capital from internal and external sources. Events or circumstances may cause actual results to differ materially from those predicted, as a result of the risk factors set out and other known and unknown risks, uncertainties, and other factors, many of which are beyond the control of Bellatrix. In addition, forward looking statements or information are based on a number of factors and assumptions which have been used to develop such statements and information but which may prove to be incorrect and which have been used to develop such statements and information in order to provide shareholders with a more complete perspective on Bellatrix's future operations. Such information may prove to be incorrect and readers are cautioned that the information may not be appropriate for other purposes. Although the Company believes that the expectations reflected in such forward looking statements or information are reasonable, undue reliance should not be placed on forward looking statements because the Company can give no assurance that such expectations will prove to be correct. In addition to other factors and assumptions which may be identified herein, assumptions have been made regarding, among other things: the impact of increasing competition; the general stability of the economic and political environment in which the Company operates; the timely receipt of any required regulatory approvals; the ability of the Company to obtain qualified staff, equipment and services in a timely and cost efficient manner; drilling results; the ability of the operator of the projects which the Company has an interest in to operate the field in a safe, efficient and effective manner; the ability of the Company to obtain financing on acceptable terms; field production rates and decline rates; the ability to replace and expand oil and natural gas reserves through acquisition, development of exploration; the timing and costs of pipeline, storage and facility construction and expansion and the ability of the Company to secure adequate product transportation; the ability for all parties to satisfy all conditions for closing the acquisition; future commodity prices; currency, exchange and interest rates; the regulatory framework regarding royalties, taxes and environmental matters in the jurisdictions in which the Company operates; and the ability of the Company to successfully market its oil and natural gas products. Readers are cautioned that the foregoing list is not exhaustive of all factors and assumptions which have been used. As a consequence, actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in the forward-looking statements. Additional information on these and other factors that could affect Bellatrix's operations and financial results are included in reports, including under the heading "Risk Factors" in the Company's annual information form for the year ended December 31, 2017, on file with Canadian and United States securities regulatory authorities and may be accessed through the SEDAR website (www.sedar.com[http://www.sedar.com]), through the SEC website (www.sec.gov[http://www.sec.gov]), and at Bellatrix's website (www.bxe.com[http://www.bxe.com]). Furthermore, the forward looking statements contained herein are made as at the date hereof and Bellatrix does not undertake any obligation to update publicly or to revise any of the included forward looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as may be required by applicable securities laws.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NON-GAAP MEASURES: Throughout this press release, the Company uses terms that are commonly used in the oil and natural gas industry, but do not have a standardized meaning presented by International Financial Reporting Standards ("IFRS") and therefore may not be comparable to the calculations of similar measures for other entities. Management believes that the presentation of these non-GAAP measures provide useful information to investors and shareholders as the measures provide increased transparency and the ability to better analyze performance against prior periods on a comparable basis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Net operating income is calculated by subtracting royalties, transportation, and operating expenses from total revenue. Management believes this measure is a useful supplemental measure of the amount of total revenue received after transportation, royalties and operating expenses. Net operating income multiple is calculated as the purchase price of an acquisition divided by the net operating income from the related acquisition. With respect to the assets acquired from <span class="companylink">Daewoo</span>, the net operating income multiple is calculated as follows: approximate purchase price of $9.5 million divided by 2019 forecast net operating income from such assets of $3.5 million. This non-IFRS measure is used by management to analyze the metrics of an acquisition.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These measures have been described and presented in this news release in order to provide shareholders and potential investors with additional information regarding the benefits of the acquisition on Bellatrix's liquidity and its ability to generate funds to finance its operations.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Crude prices sank to new lows for the year on Friday, sending Canadian energy stocks into a tailspin and adding to concerns that the damage is spreading well beyond the oil patch.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The re-emergence of an oversupply in the global oil market dragged U.S. crude down by 7.8 per cent on Friday to just above the US$50-a-barrel mark in what has been a swift descent from more than US$76 in just two months. The price for Western Canadian select – Canada’s heavy-oil benchmark – fell to just US$1 a barrel above an all-time low of US$13.46 on Nov. 15.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The bear market in oil globally combined with a persistent discount on Alberta crude has resulted in a powerful double negative for Canadian energy stocks. The S&P/TSX energy index slumped nearly 5 per cent Friday to levels not far off the depths of the 2014-to-2016 crash in oil prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Shares of big Canadian energy producers such as <span class="companylink">Suncor Energy Inc</span>., <span class="companylink">Canadian Natural Resources Ltd</span>. and <span class="companylink">Cenovus Energy Inc</span>. on Friday posted losses of between 4 per cent to 8 per cent, leaving them with declines of 20 per cent to 35 per cent since mid-July.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Problems in Canada’s oil patch are rippling through to other companies with exposure to the sector. The S&P/TSX Composite Index is down by 7.4 per cent so far this year, reinforcing the sway the energy sector still holds over the Canadian market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“In terms of sentiment and the view towards the Canadian stock market, the influence of oil is as large now as it ever has been,” said Ryan Bushell, president and portfolio manager of Toronto-based Newhaven Asset Management.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Take the big Canadian bank stocks, which are on pace for their second-worst calendar year since the financial crisis. Despite decent earnings growth, bank valuations are close to the bottom of their historical range.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Canadian dollar, meanwhile, has recently rekindled its close relationship with the global price of oil, having dropped by 6 US cents from its 2018 high.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are casualties of the oil sell-off to be found throughout the Canadian market. These are some of the non-energy names feeling the squeeze, showing their share-price declines from their respective 52-week highs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">Methanex Corp</span>., down by 30.0 per cent</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This Vancouver-based company is the world’s largest supplier of methanol, which is used in the production of a number of chemicals, plastics, and as an additive to gasoline. A good portion of the demand for methanol is energy-related, making the stock highly susceptible to oil fluctuations. “We believe there is good upside for investors who are bullish on the global economy,” Nelson Ng, an RBC Dominion Securities analyst, said in a recent note.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">Boardwalk REIT</span>, down by 18.3 per cent</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Boardwalk’s portfolio of residential rental properties is heavily concentrated in Alberta, where housing demand rises and falls with the oil economy. Never having really recovered from the bear market in oil starting four years ago, Boardwalk’s share price is under renewed pressure now. “Is this the new normal?” Canaccord Genuity analyst Brendon Abrams wrote. “An expectation that [the] current woes facing Alberta’s primary economic driver, the energy sector, will be resolved in the near term, requires … a very optimistic viewpoint.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">Finning International Inc</span>., down by 22.5 per cent</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As a <span class="companylink">Caterpillar</span> dealer focused on Western Canada, Finning is active in providing heavy machinery to oil-patch companies. The prospect of production cuts tends to weigh on the company’s stock whenever crude hits a sustained downturn. “But it shouldn’t go down one for one with the oil price, and that’s kind of what’s happened,” Mr. Bushell said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">Canadian Western Bank</span>, down by 31.3 per cent</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After its stock bottomed out in early 2016, it took nearly two years for CWB shares to recover from the previous Alberta recession. Now, the return of cheap oil has resurrected fears of slowing loan growth and rising loan losses. “<span class="companylink">Canadian Western Bank</span> likely faces the highest relative credit risk given its geographic concentration in Western Canada,” <span class="companylink">Veritas Investment</span> Research analyst Nigel D’Souza said in a note.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">Russel Metals Inc</span>., down by 25.8 per cent</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Between steel tariffs and the oil slide, it’s been a double whammy for Russel this year, which generates about 40 per cent of its revenues selling tubular products to oil and gas drillers. The sell-side remains relatively upbeat on the stock, however, with three out of four analysts following the company rating its stock a “buy.”</p>

<span class="companylink">General Motors</span> has officially announced it will stop production at its Oshawa plant in 2019, confirming media reports from late Sunday evening.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The move will affect thousands of jobs in the city, just east of Toronto.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is part of broader changes at the company's North American operations, including also ceasing production at assembly plants in Ohio and Michigan, according to a press release posted to GM's website Monday morning.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to GM's website, the Oshawa Assembly Plant employs 2,522 workers with Unifor Local 222. Production began on Nov. 7, 1953, and in the 1980s the plant employed roughly 23,000 people. The plant is used to make the Cadillac XTS and Chevrolet Impala sedans as well as the Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra trucks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The actions we are taking today continue our transformation to be highly agile, resilient and profitable, while giving us the flexibility to invest in the future,” GM Chairman and CEO Mary Barra said in the release.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We recognize the need to stay in front of changing market conditions and customer preferences to position our company for long-term success.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The company will lay off 14,700 factory and white-collar workers in North America and put five plants up for possible closure as it restructures to cut costs and focus more on autonomous and electric vehicles.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">About 6,000 factory workers could lose jobs in the U.S. and Canada. The reduction includes 8,100 white-collar workers, some of whom will take buyouts and others who will be laid off.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Monday morning, dozens of workers were seen walking out of the Oshawa plant, with some saying they were very unhappy with news of the planned closure.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One man said the union had told workers at the plant to go home and would be speaking with employees at an afternoon meeting.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Most workers leaving the plant declined to speak, just shaking their heads.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“This one just caught everyone by surprise. Normally, you have some idea when something like this is coming. We're all just in shock,” said one worker, who didn't give his name because he wasn't authorized to speak with the media.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“It's kind of fitting that we're out in the cold and rain,” he added, before getting into his car and driving off.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Premier Doug Ford, who recently unveiled an “Ontario — Open For Business” sign along the U.S. border at Sarnia, said the GM announcement is “devastating” for GM workers and auto parts suppliers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We'll do whatever it takes to make sure they get back on their feet,” he pledged in the legislature after a call with Prime Minister Justin Trudeau to ask for an extension of employment insurance eligibility when layoffs occur, as has been done in Alberta's oil patch, and to press the federal government to continue working with the U.S. to remove punitive steel tariffs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The province, which got official notification from GM of its plans on Sunday afternoon, is also deploying its rapid re-employment and training services program to help workers in Oshawa with training for other jobs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NDP Leader Andrea Horwath said the government should be pushing GM for new products to save the plant and its workers livelihoods instead of “waving bye-bye” to the jobs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“They don't want an adjustment program. They want to keep their jobs,” she thundered in the legislature's daily question period. “I've never seen a government roll over so quickly and throw in the towel.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ford said of his talks with GM that “they told me straight up, there's nothing we can do….they're gone.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He accused Horwath of wanting to give billions of dollars to a company that “doesn't want it.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As a TV announcer read out portions of GM's news release, the bustling lobby of Unifor Local 222 headquarters went silent. A few exasperated sighs, and the occasional four-letter word was heard.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Unifor, the union representing more than 2,500 workers at the plant, said it has been informed that there is no product allocated to the Oshawa plant past December 2019.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a statement, Unifor local 222 leadership said they do not “accept the closure of the plant as a foregone conclusion.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The union is assuring members that we are calling on <span class="companylink">General Motors Canada</span> to allocate product to Oshawa. The Oshawa assembly plant is GM's most decorated plant with a highly skilled, committed workforce.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The statement added “our plant has been in this situation before with no product on the horizon, and we were able to successfully campaign for continued operations.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the fall, the Detroit automaker offered buyouts to 18,000 white collar workers, but it has yet to say how many accepted, or if it's close to meeting the staff reduction goals it set to better withstand leaner times.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Interim Liberal leader John Fraser said the GM Oshawa situation has Ontario”on the verge the worst economic catastrophe to hit Ontario since the Great Recession a decade ago” and questioned why <span class="companylink">Ford</span> was blindsided.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“There is a short window to win a new mandate from GM for electric or autonomous vehicles. Mr. Ford should work closely with the union and the federal government to win that mandate,” said Fraser, the MPP for Ottawa South.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At Queen's Park, NDP MPP Jennifer French, representing Oshawa, expressed grave concern about the news.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Words cannot fully describe the anxiety that my community is feeling at this moment.”</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The crunch in Canada's oil market is taking a "drip-drip-drip" toll on the economy, with the threat of even deeper trouble.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Already, oil patch producers are pulling back and economists are cutting their forecasts for economic growth in Alberta, whose fortunes, of course, affect the country.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At this point, many are pinning their hopes on an early December meeting of <span class="companylink">OPEC</span> producers and their allies to agree a supply cap. Never mind that President Donald Trump is pushing for lower prices, and backing Saudi Arabia in other areas, the group is expected nonetheless to agree to production cuts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Oil prices regained some ground today after Friday’s drop, but Brent crude remained below US$60 a barrel, while West Texas intermediate, the U.S. benchmark was just above US$51.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While global oil prices have plunged, much of the focus is on Western Canada Select, or WCS, a blend of oil sands bitumen and heavy oil, which has suffered an exceptional discount to Brent and WTI.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The longer the extreme lows persist for Canadian oil prices, the greater the economic damage for Alberta, and thus the national economy,” said Bank of Montreal chief economist Douglas Porter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The received wisdom is that WCS will mount a comeback in coming months, but in the meantime, we will keep shaving our growth forecasts on a drip-drip-drip basis until that recovery shows up in the real world," he added.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Indeed, last week <span class="companylink">BMO</span> cut its forecast for economic growth in Alberta to 1.7 per cent from 2.1 per cent in a new projection “that’s probably about a point lower than had oil prices not gone into the tank in the past two months,” Mr. Porter said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Toronto-Dominion Bank economist Omar Abdelrahman and senior economist Brian DePratto calculated production cuts so far will trim half a percentage point from fourth-quarter economic growth, but Canada will regain that as the WCS discount narrows next year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That would mean only a “muted impact” on economic expansion next year, albeit “slightly more pronounced” in Alberta, with a modest hit to Saskatchewan. Production cuts are expected to shave up to half a percentage point from fourth-quarter growth in Canada, and 0.1 of a point from what would otherwise would have been projected in the first quarter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Alberta’s growth alone could be hit to the tune of 0.2 to 0.3 of a percentage point throughout 2019.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But look out if it doesn't improve.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"If current pricing holds, impacts on real activity, incomes, and government revenues would quickly mount," Mr. Abdelrahman and Mr. DePratto said in a report.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"In that instance, Alberta’s economy would be hard-hit and national Canadian growth could be cut by as much as 0.5 of a percentage point relative to our current baseline path," they added.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Meanwhile, producers have been resorting to less-than-ideal measures in response to this. Perhaps the most significant near-term support will come from producers’ recently announced temporary production shut-ins, estimated to now surpass 160,000 barrels per day for both November and December, with the purpose of gradually balancing the existing glut."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They have also ramped up shipments by rail to record numbers to help get around pipeline constraint issues.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WCS discounts "of this extreme magnitude" tend to last no longer than a few months, Mr. Abdelrahman and Mr. DePratto said, projecting the differential to WTI will narrow to between US$20 to US$25 over the next several quarters.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Obviously, the mess in the oil market is a threat to the outlook, said Stephen Brown, senior Canada economist at Capital Economics.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"At $51 at the time of writing, WTI is dangerously close to dropping below the $50 level that we think would start to cause serious pain for the Canadian oil industry," he said in a report.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Even if WTI remains just above $50, the drop in Western Canadian Select to just $15 per barrel is consistent with declines in production before the end of the year.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Earl Sweet, head of economic risk at <span class="companylink">BMO</span>, believes the oil cartel and its allies, a group observers call OPEC+, will cut supply sufficiently to see a moderate boost in prices, and that WTI will average US$62 a barrel next year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That's down from <span class="companylink">BMO</span>'s earlier projection of US$65 a barrel. And, as Mr. Sweet noted, it's well below the US$73 a barrel, based on an average of WTI, Brent and Dubai crude, that the <span class="companylink">International Monetary Fund</span> calculates as Saudi Arabia's fiscal break-even level.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“In Canada, producers will continue to be heavily challenged by a very wide discount from global oil prices until transportation capacity out of Alberta is increased,” Mr. Sweet said, echoing the complaints of many observers about pipeline delays.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“As oil production in Alberta continues to grow, the seemingly interminable delays to projects targeting expanded pipeline capacity to the United States (Keystone XL) and to the Pacific coast (Trans Mountain) have caused local supplies to accumulate,” he added, though, like the TD economists, he also expects the WCS differential to narrow next year, though remain high, as more oil is shipped by rail and <span class="companylink">Enbridge Inc</span>. completes an overhaul of one its pipes.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What to watch for this week</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Define a symbiotic relationship: Canada's economy and its big banks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Both are in the spotlight this week as <span class="companylink">Statistics Canada</span> reports on third-quarter economic growth and the major banks begin posting quarterly results.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Growth popped higher in the second quarter, but momentum has slowed since then,” CIBC World Markets senior economist Royce Mendes said of what’s expected in Friday’s report on gross domestic product in the third quarter</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Household spending appears to be feeling the pinch of higher interest rates," he added.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"So is the housing market, which is also being dragged lower by tighter mortgage lending standards. Even the positive contribution from net trade will show up as a result of imports falling more than exports, rather than anything more constructive for the Canadian economy."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Analysts generally expect the report to show the economy expanded between July and September at an annual pace of between 1.8 and 2 per cent, with September alone showing a slim gain of just 0.1 per cent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Friday's reading will feed into expectations of whether the <span class="companylink">Bank of Canada</span> could raise its benchmark rate again in December or wait until January.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The economy was searching for growth engines in Q3, as the one big source of support - net exports - came with a twist, since the improvement was led by a drop in imports," said <span class="companylink">BMO</span>'s Mr. Porter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Otherwise, look for slim gains in consumer spending and business investment, and a flat performance for housing," he added.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Before that, though, <span class="companylink">Bank of Nova Scotia</span> kicks off its industry's fourth-quarter reporting season on Tuesday, followed later in the week by <span class="companylink">Royal Bank of Canada</span>, <span class="companylink">Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce</span> and <span class="companylink">Toronto-Dominion Bank</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The quarter will be neither hot nor cold, Barclays analyst John Aiken projected in his lookahead to the bank reports.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“But a steady, uneventful close to [fiscal year 2018] may be just right: Heading into Q4, we believe the Canadian banks will deliver a solid close to the year, which should translate into mid-single-digit earnings growth for FY18,” Mr. Aiken said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Over all, we believe the following trends will resonate in the quarter: positive margins; steady loan growth; normalizing but still benign credit quality; weaker investment banking fees and stabilizing trading revenues; a higher [efficiency ratio] driven by a 'kitchen sink' Q4, but core operating leverage remaining positive; a more modest [foreign exchange] tailwind to the bottom line; and dividend hikes from BMO, NA, and LB," he added, the latter to referring to National Bank and <span class="companylink">Laurentian Bank</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Stock values could benefit, according to the Barclays analyst.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"While bank valuations have been caught in the broader market downdraft, we believe that there may be investor concerns of a domestic operating environment that remains challenged, underscored by slower loan growth and an economic cycle that is likely in the late innings," Mr. Aiken said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"That said, we believe the banks' relatively defensive positioning, including steady mid-single-digit earnings growth, fairly diversified businesses to weather a slowdown, their historical 'flight to safety' trade, and a solid dividend yield of 4.3 per cent offers compelling counterpoints to fend off the bears."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MONDAY</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's Cyber Monday. And it's probably a good thing that the economics and earnings calendar is rather light, so you don't need to divert from online shopping for too long.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Britain and the <span class="companylink">EU</span> agreed to a divorce deal on the weekend, but Prime Minister Theresa May now has to get it through her own Parliament.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Fear of no deal has hurt the sector in the past few weeks, and these tests will be a valuable indicator as well as insurance policy for investors to reassure them that the U.K. banking sector will be capable of riding out any number of Brexit scenarios."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">Statistics Canada</span> is expected to report that the country's current account deficit narrowed nicely in the third quarter, but watch what you read into that.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists project the shortfall will come in at about $11.5-billion to $12-billion, a far cry from the second quarter's $15.9-billion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"In nominal terms, exports showed a healthy increase, though that was attributable to price increases rather than volumes, which were actually slightly lower during the period," said CIBC's Mr. Mendes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Nominal imports were roughly flat during the quarter only because prices rose as real imports were down. Given the drop in real imports, the narrowing current account deficit shouldn’t leave markets with a sense of optimism regarding domestic demand."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Watch, too, for quarterly results from TD and CIBC, and the minutes from the last Fed meeting.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">FRIDAY</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Besides Canada's GDP report, a lot is riding on a G20 summit in Buenos Aires, notably the expected side meeting between presidents Donald Trump and Xi Jinping, who are in the midst of a trade war.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Expectations have slowly been dialed down about a possible solution in the short term, with the prospect that tariffs could well increase at the beginning of next year from the current 10 per cent to an increased rate of 25 per cent,” said CMC’s Mr. Hewson.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“While deal expectations have been set to a low level an agreement to not implement the proposed increased rate at the beginning of next year could be described as progress.”</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">You have to give Prime Minister Justin Trudeau some credit for showing up in a city in which he is so detested.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But show up the PM did this week in Calgary, to offer less-than-soothing assurances that he understands the depth of the pain the city, and province of Alberta generally, is experiencing. Not surprisingly, those attending the Chamber of Commerce speech that he gave were in no mood to offer the federal leader anything resembling a warm and hearty reception.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The atmosphere in the room was as icy as that outside, where 2,000 protesters screamed for a pipeline to get built.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There is justifiable anger in the province. The oil industry is in tatters at the moment. The discount that Alberta crude is suffering at the U.S. border is at historic highs. The situation will undoubtedly improve, but likely not for a few months. Meantime, the province’s economic pain is real, and not to be diminished.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Not surprisingly, much of the rhetoric coming out of the province is laced with anger and vitriol. Some of the viewpoints are reasonable. Many are not, the most common one among those being that if this were Ontario or Quebec suffering this same fate, action would have been taken by now.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I find that take on the situation somewhat bewildering. If I’m not mistaken, it was Mr. Trudeau who spent $4.5-billion to buy the Trans Mountain pipeline and the rights to the expansion of it. If it gets built, Ottawa will deserve some credit for rescuing the project when its original proponent, <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span>, decided it wanted no part of it. I mean, that has to count for something.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">People want to blame the Trudeau Liberals for the recent Federal Court of Appeal decision that put the pipeline expansion on hold over a lack of proper consultation with Indigenous groups, among other things. Well, sure, condemn Ottawa all you want if it makes you feel better. But we are living in far different times than we were even 10 years ago. The <span class="companylink">Supreme Court of Canada</span> has changed the rules of engagement when it comes to building resource projects in this country. And governments, including the one in the nation’s capital, are still trying to figure out how to proceed, and what, precisely, constitutes fair and reasonable consultation with First Nations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If the federal government hurries the Trans Mountain process again in a bid to get shovels in the ground soon, then the whole matter is going to end up back in court again, with likely the same outcome. They need to get it right this time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While likely no one at his Chamber of Commerce speech wanted to hear it, the one undeniably true thing Mr. Trudeau said Thursday afternoon was this: “It’s like you think there’s a super simple answer. There’s not. This is a multifaceted, complex issue."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One option being discussed for providing the province some relief is increasing rail capacity. Obviously, that’s not an ideal solution, but it’s something. Premier Rachel Notley is hoping Ottawa will become a willing partner (see: provide financial help) in increasing the number of locomotives that are shipping Alberta oil to the coast. Mr. Trudeau was noncommittal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New tank cars would have to be ordered. It would take a year or more to see any benefit from this plan. I’m not sure how that gives Alberta the instant support it’s looking for from the feds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Finance Minister Bill Morneau announced changes to capital cost write-downs in his recent economic update that should provide almost immediate aid to the oil and gas industry in Alberta. But while that is viewed as a positive step, it’s not nearly enough to save the oil industry from its current depths of despair.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I have enormous sympathy for those whose livelihoods are being severely impacted by the oil slump. There are thousands of jobs at stake. The province’s finances are reeling. But the fact remains there is no easy fix, despite all the pleas from Albertans looking for exactly that.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">People can point the finger at Justin Trudeau all they want for what is taking place. But remember when you point the finger at someone else, there are three fingers pointing back at you.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the climate change hypocrisy sweepstakes, it’s hard to beat Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. But he sure talks a good game.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Climate change is a clear and present danger, he says. Left unchecked, it will have dire consequences for the environment, the global economy and humanity itself. In late 2015, just before he enthusiastically endorsed the Paris climate change accord, Trudeau said: “The atmosphere doesn’t care where carbon is emitted. It requires us to take action all around the world.”</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In came plans for a carbon tax, which is now being imposed on any province without its own emissions pricing. The tax will start next year at $20 for every tonne of greenhouse gas emissions and will raise fuel prices, but it is designed to be revenue neutral. Canadians will receive rebates (the average Ontario family would get about $300 a year). So far, so good. But now look at what’s happening.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Less than a year after Canada endorsed the Paris deal, the federal government approved <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span>’s Trans Mountain pipeline expansion. The pipeline connects Alberta to the British Columbia coast and would give the oil sands, one of the world’s most carbon-intensive energy projects, a vast new market in Asia.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last spring, when a regulatory war between Alberta and B.C. put the pipeline into deep-freeze, <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span> abandoned the project. To keep it alive, the Trudeau Liberals spent $4.5 billion of taxpayers' money to nationalize it. They also approved the Enbridge Line 3 crude oil pipeline, from Alberta to Wisconsin. “I’ve said many times that there isn’t a country in the world that would find billions of barrels of oil and leave it in the ground while there is a market for it,” Trudeau said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In yet another Jekyll-and-Hyde moment in Trudeau’s initiatives on the climate file, he came out in support of the $40-billion LNG Canada project in October. Owned by a consortium of oil and gas companies led by <span class="companylink">Royal Dutch Shell</span>, the project will take gas from the Montney fields on the Alberta—B.C. border and send it by pipeline to a terminal near Kitimat, B.C., where it will be turned into liquefied natural gas (LNG) and shipped to Asia.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">LNG Canada is a carbon hog. It is also incompatible with B.C.'s carbon-reduction targets and Canada’s ostensible enthusiasm to meet the Paris agreement objectives, which seek to limit average global temperature increases to 1.5 C over pre-industrial levels.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Thanks to a carbon tax that is held up as a worldwide gold standard, B.C. was making credible progress in reducing emissions from all sources. In 2015, emissions were equivalent to 61.6 million tonnes of carbon dioxide, down 4.7% from the 2007 baseline year, even during robust economic growth. The province’s emissions targets were set to fall rapidly to 39 million tonnes in 2030, 26 million tonnes in 2040 and 13 million tonnes a decade later.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">LNG Canada’s domestic emissions, at best, threaten to make those targets much more difficult to meet. At worst, they will blow the province’s entire carbon budget. Marc Lee, a senior economist at the <span class="companylink">Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives</span>, delivered a submission to the B.C. government in August that calculated that the emissions from LNG Canada’s first phase alone would range from nine million to 12 million tonnes of carbon dioxide a year. That’s about double the emissions of B.C.'s entire existing oil and gas industry.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">LNG Canada says the annual emissions would be 3.5 million tonnes. But the figure apparently assumes the production of hydro power from a massive legally contested dam that has yet to be built.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Using Lee’s figure, LNG Canada alone would consume between 23% and 31% of B.C.'s allowable emissions by 2030, rising to between 69% and 92% by 2050. For LNG Canada (and other new LNG plants) to operate at full capacity, everyone else in B.C. would have to reduce emissions drastically. But who? Is the government going to buy every driver an electric car?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The LNG Canada figures, by the way, exclude emissions from burning the fuel in Asia. Add those to the B.C. emissions, and the total would reach 93 million tonnes of planet-warming CO2 a year when the project reaches capacity, Lee says. The project’s backers, including the Trudeau government, argue that the LNG would displace coal in China. That’s a big assumption. The LNG might fill new energy demand or even displace clean energy sources such as solar power.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When then prime minister Stephen Harper yanked Canada from the Kyoto climate accord in 2011, environmentalists labelled him a fossil. Perhaps, but he wasn’t a hypocrite. He knew Canada had zero chance of meeting carbon-reduction targets as long as it remained a resources-based economy, and he was right. Trudeau is promising a greener future, but his enthusiasm for carbon-intensive projects belies that image. Canada is still part of the global warming problem.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I don’t want to dismiss the extensive investigative journalism and work that went into this article, which deserves a long and careful reading and re-reading. But this was an open secret to anyone following the oil and gas industry. “Privatize profits, socialize costs” has been its mantra for decades, and governments have been its silent partners in ignoring environmental costs right from the start.  - Mark Shore[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/canada/article-hustle-in-the-oil-patch-inside-a-looming-financial-and-environmental/?commentId=6c832181-4bcc-484e-a826-df2d9a3018b8]

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Great reporting. The process of privatizing profit, pillaging the commons and socializing losses is how the extraction industries roll. And, as the writers note, "ultimately it has left taxpayers to shoulder a financial and environmental mess." It would one thing if there was a sovereign wealth fund that made Albertans real stakeholders. Instead, Albertans have been played for chumps by carpetbaggers and hustlers. - Moseby1[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/canada/article-hustle-in-the-oil-patch-inside-a-looming-financial-and-environmental/?commentId=3ee4bc01-644c-41ac-be99-fe08fba728eb]
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Excellent investigation. There were several references to the Alberta Energy Regulator which was once a respected regulatory agency when it was the original Energy Resources Conservation Board which made sure the energy industry obeyed the rules and served the best interests of the public. When the Klein government reformed the Board it became split between its responsibilities which resulted in a weakened regulatory agency in favour to a 'pedal to the metal' industry-friendly philosophy which worked as long as oil and gas prices were good and royalties helped balance a budget in the face of inadequate provincial revenues. When world prices tanked so did the mythical 'Alberta Advantage'. Happily, the Liberals and Justin Trudeau are now available to absorb every criticism and blame for the made-in-Alberta (and conservative governments') problem despite rescuing the Trans Mountain Pipeline project from oblivion. - Jimbo5[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/canada/article-hustle-in-the-oil-patch-inside-a-looming-financial-and-environmental/?commentId=492411fd-34ff-410c-99c5-d7da2bfde326]

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I'll just add, that everyone Canadian without exception has benefited in a multitude of ways from these wells. Governments have collected royalties from the oil & natural gas extracted. Governments have collected taxation many times over from the oil & gas extracted. Every single Canadian has continually benefited from oil & gas extraction. Life absent of oil & natural gas would be vastly different, vastly inferior to the lives we lead today. Canadians really have no call to get their knickers in a knot about oil & gas extraction. Can we do better, absolutely! But let’s ensure we do better in a way that causes the least harm to everyone involved. - kbaumgart[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/canada/article-oil-patch-fails-to-clean-up-growing-stockpile-of-abandoned-wells/?commentId=39a33e27-971b-4461-8c54-f7b2bb860fb8]

(“Strad” or the “Company”) (TSX:SDY) today announced that the Toronto Stock Exchange ("TSX") has accepted Strad's notice of intention to commence a normal course issuer bid (the "NCIB"). Under the NCIB, Strad may purchase for cancellation, from time to time, as Strad considers advisable, up to a maximum of 4,067,205 class A shares of the Company ("Common Shares"), which represents 10% of the public float of the 57,244,420 issued and outstanding Common Shares as at November 15, 2018. Purchases of Common Shares may be made on the open market through the facilities of the TSX and through other alternative Canadian trading platforms at the prevailing market price at the time of such transaction. The actual number of Common Shares that may be purchased for cancellation and the timing of any such purchases will be determined by Strad, subject to a maximum daily purchase limitation of 7,213 Common Shares which equates to 25% of Strad's average daily trading volume of 28,852 for the six months ended October 31, 2018. Strad may make one block purchase per calendar week which exceeds the daily repurchase restrictions. Any Common Shares that are purchased by Strad under the NCIB will be cancelled.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The NCIB will commence on November 28, 2018 and will terminate on November 27, 2019 or such earlier time as the NCIB is completed or terminated at the option of Strad. Strad may enter into an automatic securities purchase plan in connection with the NCIB which would permit the Company to repurchase its Common Shares during periods of blackout or other periods in which the Company would not ordinarily be permitted to repurchase its Common Shares. Such automatic securities purchase plan would be subject to certain parameters set by the Company from time to time which would govern the automatic purchase of Common Shares.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Strad believes that from time to time the market price of the Common Shares may not reflect their underlying value and that, at such times, the purchase of Common Shares for cancellation may represent an opportunity to enhance shareholder value. Strad intends to use the NCIB to enhance total long-term shareholder returns in conjunction with management’s strategic focus on growing the Company’s Industrial Matting business. Pursuant to the Company’s previous NCIB which expired on September 13, 2018, the Company purchased and cancelled an aggregate of 2,768,320 Common Shares at an average price paid of $1.49 per Common Share.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">ABOUT STRAD Strad specializes in industrial matting and equipment rentals for projects of any size, from a network of branches across Canada and the United States.

In October, Questor was independently tested under <span class="companylink">EPA</span> testing procedures in North Dakota and, once again, confirmed its performance in excess of 99.99%. In what can be referred to as a game-changing solution, our high-performance emissions control delivers value in the form of increased oil production for our clients while limiting NOx and VOCs to low and compliant levels. Questor expects that approximately 30% of the existing rental fleet will be operating in the State of North Dakota during 2019.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Company recently announced that rental units are scheduled to be mobilized to Texas in the fourth quarter of this year. Questor is pleased to confirm that it has secured a 24 month contract with a new client in Texas commencing December 2018. The contract represents approximately $1.0 million of the $5 million announcement. The Permian Basin continues to be active while facing flaring restrictions in an area lacking sufficient infrastructure to handle the associated gas produced with the oil. This lack of pipeline take-away capacity in the basin is creating interest in our rental equipment to deal with the gas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Questor continues to enlist new clients for its rental fleet in Colorado which was one of the company’s objectives for 2018 and into the future. The balance of the $5 million announcement is a 12 month contract with a new client in the basin. Colorado’s Regulation 7 mandates the use of enclosed combustion and now targets methane, resulting in a statewide focus on the responsible management of potentially fugitive hydrocarbons.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Justin Mahendra, Vice President Sales and Marketing says, “With the implementation of these contracts Questor has successfully accessed the North Dakota and Texas markets while increasing our footprint in Colorado providing strategic diversification of our client and revenue base.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With the significant increase in US demand, the Company recommenced the capital program and is currently building additional rental units that will be mobilized to the Colorado, North Dakota and Texas markets. In order to execute the contracts successfully Questor will open a service Centre in North Dakota and we are presently evaluating optimal locations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Questor will continue to commit capital to regions where producers are looking for high performing, cost-effective technologies to manage their waste gas and fugitive emissions,” commented Audrey Mascarenhas, Questor’s President and CEO. Mrs. Mascarenhas went on to say, "The opportunity for our technology solutions continues to grow and the team at Questor is ideally positioned to continue to deliver meaningful cost-effective innovative solutions while supporting new strategic areas.”</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sources say the closing, which would affect roughly 2,500 unionized workers, is part of a restructuring[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/business/article-general-motors-to-shut-down-oshawa-plant-sources-say/] of GM’s operations to focus on autonomous and zero-emission vehicles. The plant is slated to be idle in a year, GM told the union that represents the autoworkers. The federal government will be examining the impact of the closing and what measures it might take to help laid-off workers. The Oshawa plant, which has been a key hub for GM for more than 100 years, was saved from imminent closing in 2016 after GM said it would invest $400-million to upgrade an assembly line.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The oil patch has failed to clean up a growing stockpile of abandoned wells</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Data show[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/canada/article-oil-patch-fails-to-clean-up-growing-stockpile-of-abandoned-wells/] 84,569 wells in B.C., Alberta and Saskatchewan have been abandoned as Canada’s biggest oil and gas companies put off the cost of remediation. That’s on top of the 122,456 inactive sites tallied in a Globe investigation[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/canada/article-in-western-canada-surge-of-inactive-wells-a-brewing-disaster/] . And unlike those inactive sites, abandoned wells hold no potential for future production. Equipment has been removed and holes have been sealed, but the surrounding landscape hasn’t been restored to its predrilling state – a process that can unearth contamination of soil and water and potentially require expensive monitoring and remediation work. The numbers show how lax regulations allow companies to delay the final cleanup steps for years, and sometimes decades, after production has ceased. (for subscribers)</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Ukrainian navy said Russia’s military[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/world/article-russia-blocks-three-ukrainian-navy-ships-from-entering-sea-of-azov/] opened fire on and seized three of its ships, wounding six sailors in the process. Russia countered that the Ukrainian ships had entered Russian waters near the disputed Crimea region. Now, Ukraine is considering declaring martial law in the country, raising alarms that President Petro Poroshenko might use the incident to delay a presidential election polls suggest he’s trailing in.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Just last month, author Richard Lourie wrote about how Vladimir Putin’s newly constructed Crimean Bridge “is a piece in a political game, one that both resembles chess as well as the bait-and-switch moves of three-card Monte. The bridge not only allows Putin to safeguard Crimea, it gives him a way to fuel a conflict with Ukraine in the Sea of Azov that in turn frees him up to play peacemaker in Donetsk.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. authorities fired tear gas on migrants approaching the border</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The latest escalation in tensions[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/world/article-migrants-enveloped-in-tear-gas-sunday-after-heading-toward-us/] came after Mexican police broke up protests in Tijuana, triggering a rush toward the border. The U.S. also shut the country’s busiest border crossing, with traffic suspended in both directions between San Diego and Tijuana. Thousands of Central American migrants, mostly Hondurans fleeing poverty and violence, are camped in a sports stadium on the Mexican side after arriving in a caravan. Mexico’s government said it would deport those who attempted to “violently” and “illegally” cross the border yesterday.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“After spending the weekend studying back-to-work legislation, Canada’s Senate will continue the discussion Monday. Whether or not postal workers are mandated back to work, the deeper, existential structural problems facing Canada Post will not be fixed. Since the middle of the last decade, as with other industries including financial services, retailing and entertainment, Canada Post has experienced profound digital disruption. … The good news for Canada Post is that parcel delivery has exploded due to the phenomenal increase in e-commerce sales. Parcel revenue increased by over $400-million between 2011 and 2015 and reached the $2-billion mark last year. However, the displacement of letters with parcels masks a deeper set of structural issues facing Canada Post and the transformation to a parcel-delivery firm. The business model that underlies parcel-and-courier delivery firms is radically different from traditional postal systems.” –  Ian Lee [https://www.theglobeandmail.com/opinion/article-even-if-back-to-work-canada-post-is-still-plagued-by-deeper-issues/] , associate professor at Carleton University’s Sprott School of Business</p>

The decisions also touched a raw nerve in Quebec.

</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">VANCOUVER, British Columbia, Nov. 26, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- <span class="companylink">MGX Minerals Inc</span>. (“MGX” or the “Company”) ( / / ) is pleased to report that as of last week engineering partner PurLucid Treatment Solutions (“PurLucid”) had processed the first shipment of 40m3 of wastewater brine from an oilsands customer. The 5m3 system treated highly concentrated evaporator blowdown wastewater (“EBD”) and will provide significant cost savings for the customer. The system is currently operating at a 3rd party industrial location and the Company is pleased to report that the same steam assisted gravity drainage (“SAGD”) operator recently received an operating permit for the equipment from the Alberta Energy Regulator. A new 10m3 high temperature, high pressure system, is near completion and is expected to be deployed on site in January. The current 5m3 system will continue to operate and process water from customers. Additional systems are expected to be deployed approximately every other month through first and second quarter of 2019, with a significant acceleration of deployments thereafter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When placed within the SAGD operation itself the system will significantly reduce greenhouse gases through energy savings on steam generation. The technology provides superior treatment outcomes when compared to conventional technology which requires offsite trucking and high cost (due to toxicity) disposal. The technology can treat the water in line, under temperature and pressure, without cooling water first and is a paradigm shift advancement in waste water management and oilsands operations. This will result in significantly less energy use for water treatment, reduction in greenhouse gases and also eliminate the single major operational challenge of a (“SAGD”) facility, which is heat exchanger fouling.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lithium ExtractionDue to the high concentration effect on contained minerals of EBD wastewater, low concentration minerals are significantly increased. While not all oilsands EBD wastewater contains significant concentrated lithium. One of two current SAGD operation customers discharges wastewater that contains lithium in the 100ppm range. This lithium can be extracted by the technology once the water is cleaned of oil and bitumen as result of the front-end water treatment system processing. Commencement of lithium extraction will occur as this customer comes on line resulting in oilfield operation, small commercial scale Petrolithium extraction in the oilfield environment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“This technology represents a landmark shift in environmental services and, where there are significant concentrations of lithium, a by-product that, with the rapidly increasing demand for lithium, may now represent to the energy industry, a shift similar to that which resulted from the commercialization of natural gas. There is no doubt that on a daily basis in North America the oil and gas industry generates far more wastewater brine feedstock containing lithium (LiCl) then current global commercial lithium brine operations, largely due to the very long time solar evaporation takes, the traditional method of lithium brine extraction. As natural gas was once seen as a hinderance or waste product, to be flared off, there is a similar parallel to wastewater treatment and mineral extraction. The potential to offset surging wastewater management costs with our technology both in direct processing of water and, where applicable, extraction of lithium, may begin to solve the single biggest ancillary cost in oil & gas today. I am proud to say this technology driven shift began last week.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rapid Lithium Brine Extraction TechnologyMGX has developed a rapid lithium extraction technology eliminating or greatly reducing the physical footprint and investment in large, multi-phase, lake sized, lined evaporation ponds, as well as enhancing the quality of extraction and recovery across a complex range of brines as compared with traditional solar evaporation. This technology is applicable to petrolithium (oil and gas wastewater), natural brine, and other brine sources such as lithium-rich mine and industrial plant wastewater. The MGX was recently chosen as winner of the Base and Specialty Metals Industry Leadership Award at the 2018 S&P Global Platts Global Metals Awards.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">About PurLucidPurLucid’s exclusively licensed and patented nanoflotation technology was designed specifically for oilfield environments. The technology separates impurities from oil and gas wastewater and produces clean water as a final product. This allows for the recycling or controlled release of oilfield wastewater and reduces or eliminates downhole and associated transportation costs. Water handling costs are one of the largest operating costs in the oilfield and oilsands operations today. Learn more at . MGX currently owns 60% of PurLucid and has the right to acquire up to a 100% interest in PurLucid through successive investments.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Canada's ambassador to the United States from 1989 to 1993 and served as a director of TransCanada Corp.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Alberta's energy sector is hurting severely but few in the rest of Canada seem to care. What had been a locomotive for growth both in the province and the country is reeling under the combined pressure of collapsing oil prices and policy paralysis. What limited amounts of oil Alberta is able to export sells at roughly US$13 a barrel, 40 per cent below the world price and well below the costs of production. With world prices at US$40+ the lost revenue from the “Canadian discount" is about US$100-million a day or US$36billion a year. Cuts are being implemented by energy producers on capital spending, on work forces and on production and are prompting demands by some for <span class="companylink">OPEC</span>-style production quotas that would help stabilize the market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">All this at a time when global demand for oil and gas continues to grow. Oil production in the United States alone has increased by two million barrels a day, to 11 million, which, along with increased global production, is squeezing Canadian supply even further. Transportation costs, especially by rail, for lengthy supply chains are an additional burden.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The major problem is the chronic lack of pipeline capacity in Canada that would enable shipments to markets south, east and west of our borders. Plans have either been delayed, discarded or rejected outright by policy gridlock in Ottawa, regulatory delays and erratic, judicial activism. The only plan that is still alive is the extension of the Trans Mountain line in British Columbia. When the owner (<span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span>) backed away because of political and regulatory uncertainties, the government nationalized the project at a cost of $4.5-billion to taxpayers. Yet, there is still no guarantee that this pipeline will ever be built.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Earlier, the federal government had rejected the Northern Gateway pipeline, which has been conditionally approved by the <span class="companylink">National Energy Board</span>, leaving Trans Mountain as the only option to tidewater on the west coast.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A circuit judge in Montana, who had been appointed by former U.S. president Barack Obama, recently overruled President Donald Trump's approval of Keystone XL contending that the approval had been “political" while ignoring the fact that Mr. Obama's rejection had itself been “political" and not supported by any environmental analysis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Energy East was abandoned by the proponent (<span class="companylink">TransCanada</span>) due to the excessive regulatory burden imposed on the project and lukewarm political support from Ottawa. Meanwhile, hundreds of tankers carry oil from Saudi Arabia and other countries up the St. Lawrence River free of regulatory restrictions on “upstream emissions." (A curious bonus for Saudi Arabia these days).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Absent pipelines, shipments by rail have doubled to 400,000 b/d increasing carbon emissions if not risks substantively. New startups for refining capacity in Canada would help but only marginally.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Strong pressure from environmentalists and some Indigenous groups prompted the government to attempt a compromise allowing for a pipeline (Trans Mountain) in exchange for a commitment to a carbon tax. But the attempt at a Solomon-style balance did not work. According to polls, environmentalists represent a minority view on the issue of pipelines but that minority has major, political influence, notably in British Columbia and Quebec. Several other provinces are now resisting implementation of the carbon tax. However, Bill C-69, now before the Senate, will only add further complexity to an already stultifying process for regulatory approval.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Major shifts downward in the pump price for gasoline will challenge any government attempt to manage supply and demand with carbon taxes or “prices on pollution."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It should not be a binary choice between one or the other but there is a pressing need for a realistic balance between the two. Given the availability and demand for relatively low-priced supplies of oil and gas, the global carbon-reduction targets inspired by the Paris Accord are unattainable by any measure. Not one G20 country, including Canada, is currently compliant so a major recalibration is in order, preferably one that re-engages the United States.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There is no easy solution to the self-made conundrum. Even if pipelines were approved quickly, it would take three to four years to make them operational.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The hard reality is that Canada is losing vast amounts of revenues and curtailing its oil production while the rest of the world profits.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The principal challenges for any <span class="companylink">Canadian government</span> are national unity, prosperity and security. Given the gross dysfunction throttling Alberta energy, the first two are now in jeopardy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Calls for Western separation from frustrated Albertans are gathering steam. Speaking in Calgary on Thursday, the Prime Minister acknowledged the crisis, described the oil price as “unacceptable" adding the market factors were “complex." But “I feel your pain" empathy is not sufficient. The problem affects Canada as a whole, not just Alberta, and cries out for bold leadership that will break the logjam and serve the national interest.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Morneau, in an interview with The West Block on Global News that aired on Sunday, said the province of Alberta could buy rail cars with industry should it choose to, but that the federal government was focused on building the Trans Mountain oil pipeline expansion.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"If that's a decision that the Alberta government and the industry wants to take, that's a decision that can be taken."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The federal government is said not to favour Alberta's proposal to buy trains to boost crude shipments on rail by 120,000 barrels daily. Alberta Premier Rachel Notley has said she might buy the rail cars herself.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Morneau's economic statement, released on Nov. 21, included billions in broad-based tax breaks for business but was criticized for not doing enough to help Alberta during its oil crunch.</p>

Whilst once it seemed that Theresa May's Conservatives could safely steer the United Kingdom out of the <span class="companylink">European Union</span> with the support of a united government, that seems a stretch today.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">May faces defections and resignations from her own caucus and cabinet on an almost daily basis. The opposition seems unlikely to provide her government cover, and allies in other parties are dropping like flies. No-deal on Brexit seems increasingly likely, as does an election — one that could see Jeremy Corbyn, the radical and divisive leader of the Labour Party, elected Prime Minister.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Stability in the United Kingdom is as hard to see as a polar bear in a blizzard.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The United States is in little better condition. President Trump has battled the media and critics since the beginning of his presidency. When the Democrats took control of the House of Representatives in the midterm elections, it signalled a whole new phase in the country's internecine conflict.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It seems inevitable that Nancy Pelosi will take the speaker's gavel. Under her leadership, the Democrats will formalize the opposition to Trump in a way that hasn't been possible for two years. The democrats will wield subpoena power, chair committee investigations and erect roadblocks that will frustrate, if not freeze, Trump's agenda.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The next two years of U.S. politics will largely be an acrimonious battle between branches of government, hindering their ability to move important government initiatives forward in a meaningful way.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This sustained period of international unrest presents challenges for Canada — particularly now that there is an increasing lack of ideological alignment between our provincial and federal governments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Trudeau Liberals have ushered in a number of policies that are cheered by progressives but jeered by conservatives. The challenge, much as in the U.S., is that opposition and partisanship are becoming far more entrenched. Right wing parties have been elected across the country in the last two years, and their leaders have made little secret of their distaste for policies originating from Ottawa.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The relationship, in particular, between Queen's Park and the federal government has been strained and Doug Ford is joined by a host of premiers who seem to have little interest in idly accepting the policies the federal government is intent on implementing. These differences are real, differences based in policy disagreements fundamental to each government's outlook.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That said, there are areas of cooperation that governments of all stripes and colours can find. What's more, it is critical they do so to ensure the continued stability of Canada's economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In that regard, there have been glimmers of hope in the apparent appetite for finding areas for collaboration.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Premiers have begun working proactively with one another to eliminate trade barriers between provinces. These barriers have been invisible anchors on the Canadian economy, stifling access, innovation and competition.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Perhaps just as importantly, an olive branch was extended when <span class="companylink">Ford</span> indicated that he would be happy to work with the prime minister if the goal was to create jobs. There are other policy opportunities for the premiers and the PM to find alignment in and mutual benefit from — not the least of which is ensuring Alberta's oil can find its way to market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Ontario government mentioned its commitment to helping solve Alberta's heavy crude problem in its Fall Economic Statement, and the PM this week reiterated that the status quo cannot continue. After all, the Canadian economy is losing an estimated $80 million a day.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Alberta question is approaching a boiling point. It is against this backdrop of international instability and internal strife that the federal government has requested a first ministers' meeting next month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">All involved in this meeting would be well served to recognize the opportunity before them. With their eye on the international horizon, Canadians are watching that their governments deliver more than a lump of coal in their stockings.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hundreds of thousands of oil and gas wells dot the land across Western Canada. Almost 72,000 of them haven’t produced any oil or gas for more than five years and thousands have been dormant for more than two decades. The looming potential for environmental and economic disaster is, like the wells, just below the surface.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
In a massive, six-month investigation[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/canada/article-hustle-in-the-oil-patch-inside-a-looming-financial-and-environmental/] involving Globe journalists in Calgary, China and Toronto, we’ve discovered the pliancy of Alberta’s regulator combined with the speculation by upstart companies gambling with risk and little else has created a looming, billion-dollar problem. It’s one that that no one – individual companies, the industry itself or the governments involved – want to own.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">National environment reporter Jeff Lewis is based in Calgary and has an extensive background in covering the oil and gas sector. Jeffrey Jones, also in Calgary, is the Globe’s mergers and aquisitions reporter and has also spent years covering the oilpatch. The story that triggered their curiosity came in March when Sequoia Resources,[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/industry-news/energy-and-resources/how-chinese-energy-firm-sequoia-went-bust-and-left-behind-a-huge-bill/article38297036/] collapsed into receivership. Creditors, including several municipalities and the Alberta Energy Regulator, were left holding millions of dollars in the form of unfunded cleanup costs for thousands of oil and gas wells.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There were signs of Sequoia’s iffy finances. Still, the regulator kept approving deals, even breaking its own rules, and allowed energy companies with better balance sheets to dump their unwanted wells and with them, their environmental obligations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The reporters learned that companies backed by Chinese money were snapping up oil and gas assets from stretched Calgary-based companies. There were billions of dollars' worth of deals, bearing similarities to the rush of offshore investment in Vancouver’s real-estate market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The investigation [https://www.theglobeandmail.com/canada/article-untangling-the-hustle-in-the-oil-patch/] eventually included China correspondent Nathan VanderKlippe and investigations editor Renata D’Aliesio. The group spoke to oil executives, lawyers and investment bankers. They staked out the lobby of one Chinese-backed company until someone agreed to speak to them through an interpreter. They went door-knocking at the residential address of the headquarters of several of the companies. No one was home, but pro-wrestling legend Brett (The Hitman) Heart answered the door next door. He said he didn’t know his neighbour.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The reporting prompted this weekend’s extra supplement in the print edition of the Globe.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The story [https://www.theglobeandmail.com/canada/article-hustle-in-the-oil-patch-inside-a-looming-financial-and-environmental/] reveals few angels among those involved in the deals. Well-known companies such as <span class="companylink">Husky Energy Inc</span>., <span class="companylink">Enerplus Corp</span>., and others have been able to work around regulators to load the cleanup costs on to smaller companies that are expanding by buying the distressed wells of the bigger players, sometimes even without secure bank financing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The business plan is based on a hope that natural-gas prices will rebound and generate profits big enough to fund the cleanup of the old wells as they end their life.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But it doesn’t always work out that way.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“In Alberta, a string of corporate bankruptcies has already pushed the number of defunct well sites to 4,349, up from 545 in 2014, necessitating a $235-million loan from the provincial government last year to shore up the fund set aside by industry to pay for cleanup.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, the number of inactive, abandoned and orphaned wells i[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/canada/article-in-western-canada-surge-of-inactive-wells-a-brewing-disaster/] n Western Canada that require cleanup and reclamation has ballooned to more than 210,000. ​</p>

Residents could be forgiven for thinking that honor had shifted to Ontario. But this week in B.C. brought back daily and increasingly bizarre intrigue.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It started Monday night, when the House leaders of the legislature’s three political parties were summoned to Speaker Darryl Plecas' office and were given an outline of events they regarded as concerning enough that they agreed to pass a motion suspending with pay the legislature’s two top officers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The next day,[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/canada/british-columbia/article-clerk-of-the-bc-legislature-sergeant-at-arms-suspended-and-escorted/] after the legislature’s clerk Craig James and Sergeant-at-arms Gary Lenz presided over the morning question period, the two were called to Mr. Plecas' office where they were told they were being suspended. At the same time in the legislature, MLAs – who were told only that they should approve the motion before the House – voted unanimously to suspend the men.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The men were escorted by Victoria police from the buildings. A bewildered Mr. James, who has worked there since 1984, said he had no idea what the allegations were or why he was being suspended under police escort.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
On Wednesday, [https://www.theglobeandmail.com/canada/british-columbia/article-investigation-into-bc-legislature-officials-underway-since-at-least/] Mr. Plecas' special adviser, Alan Mullen, held several chaotic briefings in which he revealed that he had been hired in January by his friend, Mr. Plecas, to help in an investigation into the pair. The two took their concerns to police in August and on Oct. 1, two special prosecutors were appointed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
On Thursday, [https://www.theglobeandmail.com/canada/british-columbia/article-bc-liberals-accuse-speaker-of-trying-to-install-his-friend-in-security/] Liberal House Leader Mary Polak delivered a sworn statement to reporters (that alone was odd) saying that during the Monday night meeting, Mr. Plecas had proposed installing Mr. Mullen as the acting sgt-at-arms. The idea was flatly rejected, events that were confirmed by the House leaders of the other parties. Ms.. Polak also tersely said she was unaware the complaint to police was initiated by Mr. Plecas' office. Increasingly under fire, Mr. Plecas first said he would hold a news conference to release details of “extra resources” his office was being afforded. He cancelled the news conference, but Mr. Mullen read a statement announcing former judge and Liberal attorney general Wally Oppal had been hired to advise the speaker and would be doing the public talking from now on .</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Friday, a lawyer for the two suspended men[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/canada/british-columbia/article-officers-at-centre-of-bc-legislature-controversy-demand-to-return-to/] issued a letter to the three House leaders demanding Mr. James and Mr. Lenz be reinstated to their jobs. The letter said the removal “was not done at the behest of the Special Prosecutors or the RCMP.” The Liberals indicated they were having second thoughts. Leader Andrew Wilkinson said his members had assumed there had been some legal diligence before making the recommendation.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">OTTAWA -- The country's annual inflation rate picked up its pace last month to hit 2.4 per cent in an advance mostly fuelled by temporary factors like higher gasoline prices and steeper airfares, compared to a year ago, <span class="companylink">Statistics Canada</span> said Friday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The federal agency's October inflation number marked an increase from 2.2 per cent in September and pushed the reading a little farther away from the <span class="companylink">Bank of Canada</span>'s ideal, 2 per cent target.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But analysts noted Friday that the slightly stronger inflation was likely to lose some of its momentum as the short-term factors fade and, especially, as the data start to show the effects of the recent, sharp decline in oil prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For now, experts like RBC senior economist Nathan Janzen expect the <span class="companylink">Bank of Canada</span> to stay in a holding pattern at its next interest-rate decision, scheduled for Dec. 5.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With the economy running at full tilt, the central bank is on a rate-hiking path to prevent inflation from climbing too high. Market watchers are predicting governor Stephen Poloz to wait until January before his next rate increase.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">However, the timing of future rate hikes could change if the oil-price slump deepens.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"If we have something really unexpected happen on oil prices - like a dramatic (decrease) again - it will start affecting the expectations for the pace of rate hikes from the <span class="companylink">Bank of Canada</span> going forward," Janzen said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">TD senior economist James Marple wrote in a research note that the falling oil prices - and the widening spread on Canadian oil benchmarks - will be of particular importance for Poloz. Marple said the price declines will likely to lead to a drop in oil production and income losses in energy-producing regions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The impact is not negligible and will slow the pace of Canadian economic growth over the next two quarters," he wrote.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On its own, the inflation report was unlikely to nudge the <span class="companylink">Bank of Canada</span> in either direction on its next rate decision, several economists said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The main forces behind the higher inflation were year-over-year price increases of 12 per cent at the pump, 9.4 per cent for airline tickets and a 7 per cent rise in mortgage interest costs, <span class="companylink">Statistics Canada</span> said. Experts, including Poloz, have said stronger gas prices and higher airfares are expected to be short-lived.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The downward pressure last month was led by price declines of 7.2 per cent for video equipment, 4 per cent for telephone services and 3.9 per cent for traveller accommodation, compared to a year earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Consumer prices were higher last month in all provinces compared to October 2017, but Alberta was the only one to show a slower pace of inflation. A year earlier, Alberta's inflation rate was 3 per cent, while last month, it was 2.8 per cent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Ontario, <span class="companylink">Statistics Canada</span> said energy prices slid 2.4 per cent on a month-to-month basis after the provincial government got rid of its carbon cap and trade program.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The yogurt-like mix of clay, water, toxic acids, metals and leftover bitumen has sprawled in artificial ponds to cover an area twice the size of the city of Vancouver.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More than one trillion litres of the goop, called tailings, fill these man-made waste lakes that can be seen from space. An equivalent amount of water would take five days to tumble over Niagara Falls.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The contaminated tailings ponds attract and kill migrating birds. They emit methane and other greenhouse gases.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite years of public promises from officials that the tailings ponds would shrink and go away, they are growing. And in the meantime, troubling gaps are opening in the oversight system meant to ensure the oilpatch cleans up its mess. Alberta has collected only $1 billion from companies to help remediate tailings- a problem that is now estimated to cost about 100 times that.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Decades and billions have been spent on research and still there is no sure solution to a problem that is getting attention beyond Alberta. In August, the <span class="companylink">Commission for Environmental Cooperation</span> - a <span class="companylink">NAFTA</span> organization composed of officials from the U.S., Mexico and Canada - announced it would investigate and produce a report on tailings ponds and the threat they pose to surrounding groundwater and rivers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While the world watches, the mining companies operating here have been allowed by regulators to pursue a cleanup technique called water capping.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's supposed to work like this: put the tailings into a mined-out pit, then cover it with fresh water from a nearby river or reservoir. The idea, according to oil producer Syncrude, is that the tailings will settle to the bottom and over time the lake will turn into a healthy ecosystem supporting fish, animals and aquatic plants.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's biologically and chemically an impossible fantasy," said David Schindler, a former University of Alberta professor and renowned freshwater scientist and officer of the Order of Canada.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other scientists say the water-capped ponds may become effective in storing tailings even if they do not one day support aquatic life, though it will take years to be sure.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What is clear is that the technique is unproven, and by conditionally approving industry plans that include it, Alberta officials are signalling they still have no idea how they're going to clean up the waste of the oilpatch.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Alberta Energy Regulator (AER) "can approve tailings management plans that rely on unproven technologies," the agency said. Water capping "requires more research, assessment and policy direction."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The ponds, meanwhile, are polluting the air and leaking out the bottom, possibly reaching surrounding groundwater and the nearby Athabasca River.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"One day, because of the environmental impacts, my people will become environmental refugees," said Athabasca Chipewyan First Nation Chief Allan Adam.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The ponds have just grown and grown for five decades," said Jodi McNeill, policy analyst for environmental think tank Pembina Institute. "If we just continue kicking the can down the road, we could be leaving a legacy of at least tens of billions in cleanup costs ... to future generations."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Syncrude - which operates two bitumen mines in the oilsands and has nine tailings ponds - has been studying water capping since the 1980s, and says on its website that decades of company research shows it will work. That research includes the industry's first full-size water-capped tailings pond, Base Mine Lake, which was filled in 2013.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A Syncrude report about Base Mine Lake, one of two obtained by the Star, shows that after its first year, 2014, the lake was toxic and inhospitable to most aquatic life. Schindler says the report shows high levels of methane in the overlying freshwater as well as oxygen levels that no fish and few invertebrates could tolerate. The levels of ammonia were toxic to most aquatic life and the dark water severely limiting to photosynthesis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After reading the other report - detailing improving conditions in the lake two years later, in 2016 - another freshwater scientist, Neil Hutchinson, said the cap may not be deep enough to prevent wind gusts from stirring up and resuspending solids from the tailings waste about 10 metres below the surface.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's a promising approach. It's far from proven," he said. "It might (end up becoming) a safe way to store tailings, but the jury is out on whether you're going to end up with a nice self-sustaining system."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Slicks of bitumen can occasionally float to the surface, the reports show.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Schindler calls Syncrude's claim that the water-capped waste lakes will become healthy ecosystems "hubristic," and the regulator "gullible" for approving several companies' plans "without evidence that even one ... can be restored as claimed."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nearby First Nations don't want water capping. A consultant to Mikisew Cree First Nation says approving more water-capped lakes is "risky" and "irresponsible," while the Fort McKay First Nation has called the idea a "major concern" that has "never been endorsed" by its community.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Syncrude spokesperson Will Gibson said "the water quality is improving" and the tailings are "consolidating," adding that the company has spent $3 billion developing technologies to treat tailings. "We are confident this technology will prove to be successful."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Oil companies are required to return the lands they develop to a natural state. But in August, after a bankrupt company simply left the province without decommissioning and cleaning up 4,000 wells, pipelines and other facilities, the CEO of the Alberta Energy Regulator took the unusual step of publicly addressing a "gap in the system" - an admission that showed the regulator is struggling to police the oilpatch. The CEO said that the incident has prompted the AER to look at ways to fix both the AER's processes and its governing legislation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The AER publicly says the province is protected from abandonment of tailings ponds because Suncor, Imperial, Syncrude, CNRL and other companies are required to put money into a fund called the Mine Financial Security Program. The fund has collected more than $1 billion from companies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The cost to clean up the oilsands mining operations facilities? An estimated $130 billion, according to internal AER calculations revealed in a recent joint investigation by the Star, Global News and National Observer. That's $100 billion more than the public had been told before. The tailings ponds make up the largest but unknown portion of this AER estimate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To put this staggering amount into perspective, cleaning up after the 2013 Calgary flood cost $6 billion, and recovery from the Fort McMurray fire, $9 billion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If there were just a bucket of tailings in your kitchen, you could put the waste in the oven and dry it out in a few hours. Industrial-size amounts can be dried using centrifuges and additives. Drying tailings makes them easier to contain and less likely to contaminate the landscape.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"At least it doesn't flow ... We know it's there. It's a salty piece of dirt or junk," said Dan Stuckless, industry relations manager with the Mikisew Cree First Nation, located downstream of the oilsands along the Athabasca River.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Companies have also treated tailings with gypsum or polymers, which speed up the water separation process. <span class="companylink">Canadian Natural Resources Ltd</span>. is researching a way to eliminate the need for tailings ponds altogether.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Syncrude uses a $1.9-billion centrifuge, though it uses a lot of electricity. Wapisiw Lookout is a former tailings pond that Suncor dried out with a water-separating polymer and covered with soil, trees and native grasses in 2010, transforming it into a 220-hectare watershed that supports wildlife, including the occasional bear.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At one point, the AER ordered companies to solidify and bury the waste, an expensive process. Industry didn't expect it would be so difficult to remove the water from the clay and other components of tailings, said Suncor spokesperson Sneh Seetal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Industry didn't comply. The government backed off.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Water capping is relatively cheap. During a 2012 hearing into a proposed oilsands expansion, a Syncrude company lawyer suggested it would cost less money and energy and require less land disturbance than centrifuging and another method called thin-lift drying.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since 2016, four companies have told the AER they intend to use water capping despite the fact that the regulator hasn't approved the technology. Though the regulator required the companies to submit plans for alternatives in case water capping fails, only one, Suncor, submitted a plan the regulator found sufficient.The companies have proposed a total of eight water-capped lakes that would store tailings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The regulator has issued conditional approvals requiring companies to research the technology further and allowing extra time - in some cases, years - to come up with alternatives. For example, <span class="companylink">Imperial Oil</span>'s Kearl mine must present its alternative by 2027.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While AER waits, the waste is increasing, projected to reach 1.5 trillion litres by late 2030. The volume won't begin to shrink until 2037, according to company filings and the Pembina Institute.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2009, embarrassed by international media coverage when 1,600 ducks died after landing on a Syncrude tailings pond - leading to an Alberta-record $3-million fine - provincial officials introduced the directive requiring companies to dry out and bury tailings. A government spokesperson said Albertans will have "certainty on ... when and how (tailings ponds) are going to be closed ... This has teeth." Two premiers have since told Albertans the ponds would soon disappear from the landscape.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the ponds are growing, and they're right along the migratory pathways for millions of birds that use the freshwater Peace-Athabasca delta for breeding or as a stopover as they move farther north to breed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Every spring and fall the ducks, loons, herons, raptors, songbirds and other birds, some of them rare, congregate. Those seasons are stormy, sending the birds in a hurry to find a safe spot to land.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mining companies are required to place bird deterrents on and around their ponds. The result is eerie: near-constant booms of bird cannons, nightmarish shrieks of radar-activated mechanical falcons and faceless scarecrows perched above the surface.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The ruses don't always work. Every year an estimated 200,000 birds land on the oilsands' industrial water bodies, including tailings ponds, according to a 2013 report by the <span class="companylink">University of Alberta</span>'s Oil Sands Bird Monitoring Program.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It only takes a dime-size drop of oil to kill a bird," said Sarah Hechtenthal, a wildlife biologist. A spot of bitumen is difficult to get out before it puts a hole in the waterproof shell of a bird's feathers. "They're so focused on the little spot of oil, they won't eat, they won't evade predators, they get so focused on preening." The oil could trouble the bird's ability to fly or stay warm. Oil from a bird's feathers could also clog the little holes on the surface of its eggs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The ponds also leak.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While companies are required to build dikes, wells and ditches to detect tailings, collect them and divert them back to their source, some appears to be trickling to groundwater.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Seepage ... may take decades to reach surface waters," said an internal 2009 memo, written by an associate deputy minister at <span class="companylink">Environment Canada</span>, adding that "in their environmental assessments, many oilsands companies acknowledge that this may occur."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Findings from a 2014 study by Environment Canada researcher Richard Frank and a team of Canadian and British scientists indicated oilsands-tainted groundwater was likely reaching the Athabasca River, the government has said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">Environment Canada</span> called the study "seminal" but stopped its proactive inspections around this time. A spokesperson told the Star it is not clear this seepage is harmful to the environment, and there is no definitive way to differentiate between groundwater that has been tainted by industry waste water and groundwater that has been impacted by naturally occurring bitumen deposits.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We used to eat fish all the time as an important staple," said Cleo Desjarlais Reece, a member of Fort McMurray First Nation. "But nobody does that anymore."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Trappers are afraid to eat the animals they catch, fearing that the wildlife may have drunk contaminated water. "Am I safe? Am I keeping my family safe by eating this?" said Jean L'Hommecourt of Fort McKay First Nation, located 54 kilometres north of Fort McMurray and surrounded by mining operations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tailings ponds are also a source of air pollutants: "Smog-forming volatile organic compounds, methane (a greenhouse gas) and benzene (a toxic, carcinogenic volatile organic compound) ... accounting for more than 70 per cent of a facility's total," according to the 2009 memo to the federal environment minister. There is "shockingly poor regulatory oversight and lack of ambition on tailings management progress in Alberta," the Pembina Institute told the AER in a February letter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Base Mine Lake is about 50 metres deep, most of it tailings. The water ripples in the breeze. A herd of wood bison grazes nearby, a fence separating the animals from the waves lapping at the grassy shore.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mechanical falcons screech from platforms above the surfaceand the cannons boom. Steam rises from the Syncrude plant on the horizon.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Below the surface, there is low oxygen, high salinity and naphthenic acids - byproducts of oil production that are toxic to fish and may be harmful to mammals - as well as chloride "much above provincial guideline," said Schindler after reviewing the company's latest internal report.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Megan Thompson, a freshwater scientist working as a consultant to Indigenous groups in the region, also reviewed the Syncrude test-lake reports and also noted high salinity, harmful to some freshwater life and "persistently high concentration of naphthenic acids."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While Schindler noted some water-quality improvements and areas with "a handful" of organisms, natural lakes in the region would have "hundreds to a few thousand species."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I still see no convincing evidence that these are going to be productive, viable lakes. Nothing yet that would indicate that these will be the nice lakes in their promotional fantasies," said Schindler, who has testified for intervenors in resource development hearings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Before capping the Base Mine tailings, Syncrude built smaller test ponds in 1989, each holding 2,000 cubic metres of tailings and water. "In the first year, the water quality improved to support aquatic life," said Gibson, the company spokesperson.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Syncrude scaled up to four test ponds of 140,000 cubic metres in the '90s, then finished filling Base Mine Lake with water in 2013.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"What we found in our test ponds was that the technology works ... We're hoping to show it'll do that on this scale," Gibson said. "But it isn't there yet."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Canada's Oil Sands Innovation Alliance, an industry group, said water-capped - or end pit - lakes "are a best practice in the global mining industry."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the <span class="companylink">Lusatia</span> region of Germany, former coal mines have been transformed into a glimmering recreational lake district. Alberta has had success with mostly former coal mines, including Quarry Lake in Canmore.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Water-capped Berkeley Lake in Montana, a former copper mine pit that was allowed to flood in the 1980s, is now filled with reddish-brown acidic waters that threaten to contaminate a nearby town's water supply.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Base Mine Lake was approved and filled under stricter regulations and after years of research and modelling, said Jerry Vandenberg, a pit lake expert who is sometimes contracted to work in the oilsands.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Vandenberg noted, though, that typical metal mine waste is often sand-like and separates from water "very rapidly," while bitumen tailings contain clay particles that repel each other and stay suspended in the water.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Water capping is an understandable pursuit, says freshwater scientist Neil Hutchinson, who worked as a lake scientist for the Ontario environment ministry and has advised industry and government on resource development projects across Canada since becoming a consultant.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"All the tailings are out there. Those (mined-out) pits are out there, too. If you could put the two of them together to find safe, long-term storage, that's a good idea - if it works as planned."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Alberta Energy Regulator says that a company must have a plan to return the land "back to how it looked and how it was used (or similarly) before development took place."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Safe tailings storage was the main consideration for Base Mine Lake, said Vandenberg, and therefore, it is "following the right trajectories. ... We're seeing faster detoxification than what we predicted."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He also said it's reasonable to anticipate the experimental lake could able to host fish in 10 to 20 years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Greg Lawrence, an expert in rehabilitating polluted lakes and a former Canada Research Chair involved with monitoring Base Mine Lake, noted improving dissolved oxygen levels and said the tailings are settling as planned but "it is too early to make any judgments."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 2009 internal memo to the environment minister warned that after 15 to 20 years the sediments could generate methane gas bubbles "that could resuspend tailings and prevent settling and potentially mix fine tailings into this proposed water cap."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Starting in 2021, the AER will begin getting the additional water-capping information it requested from companies, plus their backup plans.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"One thing about a lake is the bottom sediments is an important part of the productivity," Schindler said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"If the whole deep part of the lake is just toxic gunk that nothing can live in, and you have this little bathtub ring around the edge where the clean water cap is, they're not going to support fish and life.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There is never going to be a situation where these lakes will be rimmed with cottages."</p>

We couldn't know how much he suffered, but with only a few words and movement in one arm, which he raised to hold the hand of a loved one, the love and mirth shown in his big brown eyes never ended.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Born in 1945 in Thorold, Ontario Bill was the youngest of four boys born to their young mother Pauline, and older Ukrainian father, William. Sadly, he lost that adoring father at only 9 years old.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A graduate of Forest Hill Collegiate and the <span class="companylink">University of Toronto</span> (engineering), Stephen had a long and rewarding career with <span class="companylink">Imperial Oil</span>. He was the consummate “family man," an engaged father who took great pride in his children's and grandchildren's accomplishments, no matter how big or small. With a wide smile and genuine laugh, he was always welcoming to old and new friends alike. He had an adventurous and gregarious spirit, he saw the potential of turning an old schoolhouse into a treasured family retreat, spearheaded family road trips to the east and west coasts, travelled extensively with Jean and friends, and visited his children in far off places. Stephen's close circle of lifelong friends and their families were always in evidence at annual cottage weekends, camping and ski trips and frequent social gatherings. He was always active, a gifted racquet player who transitioned to aquafit later in life.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In retirement, Stephen was eager to keep his mind active as well; he and Jean joined the Academy for Lifelong Learning at the <span class="companylink">University of Toronto</span>, played bridge and he particularly enjoyed reading about and discussing finance and politics.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Stephen was also community oriented and volunteered with local organizations and in many capacities at Calvin Presbyterian Church. Jean's death earlier this year was a devastating blow to Stephen. He still forged ahead, his lymphoma in remission, only to be beset by a second form of cancer, melanoma, which spread too quickly for effective treatment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He was, however, able to enjoy a cross-Canada train adventure a month before his death.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">All these jobs were in reality to support his true passion for writing. A gifted story teller and eloquent writer, he published six novels, several to critical acclaim.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">BAP was a gentle sweet man who was remarkable in his ability to connect with people on any level.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">His knowledge of history, politics and literature was profound.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">His good nature, kindness, generosity, and keen sense of humour endeared him to all who met him. He was good company, perceptive and wise, and lots of fun to be around.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Up until two years ago, Bruce was in good health and still lived on his own. After suffering a debilitating stroke in November 2016 he moved to K-wing at the Sunnybrook Veterans Centre. The care and compassion the staff and volunteers have for the vets is remarkable. We are forever in their debt.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A celebration of his life will take place on Saturday, January 12, 2:00 p.m. at the Mount Pleasant Visitation Centre, Toronto.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">November 30, 1915 November 13, 2018 Nothing perfect lasts forever, except in our memories. Beloved wife of Bill (predeceased) and mother of David (predeceased) and John, passed away peacefully on November 13th.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A word or two from Vera on her favourite pastime. Reading has always been one of my greatest pleasures. Books are silent friends and what interesting friends I have sometimes found in books and with their authors. Many worlds are opened up within the pages of books and what exciting moments when finding views and opinions similar or identical to one's own, or an amusing comment, a philosophical thought, a beautiful description or a verse of poetry. Parents often try to encourage children to read. For me it seemed natural to have a book in my hand at an early age. Echoing down the passage of time, I hear my mother's voice..."Get your nose out of that book and come here, I want you to..." I was absorbed with reading when, at age ten, I won my first prize at school, “Little Women" by Louisa M. Alcott. I still have it and lovingly open it from time to time. About the same time, I was being introduced to the joy of poetry. My favourite teacher, Miss Drackley, gave us Tennyson, Wordsworth and others. I was unaware then that these poets would accompany me throughout my life. A special thank you to Brenda D for her many years of support.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">PETER HARVEY SIMS 1933 - 2018 Peter Sims passed away at St. Mary's hospital in Kitchener, Ontario, on November 22, 2018. Peter was 85 years old.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Peter was born in Kitchener, Ontario on February 20, 1933, only child of James Kenneth Davidson Sims and Mabel Flossy Alquire Cameron. Except for his time away at Ridley College, university and law school, Peter lived his entire life in Kitchener as his father, grandfather and great-grandfather Sims had.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On a tour of Europe in 1954, Peter met Betty Byers and, in 1957, they married and built a wonderful and full life together.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Peter is predeceased by his wife, Betty and is survived by their five children, Harvey, Ellen, Kenneth, Alison and Margaret; his daughter-in-law, Kim Sims; their grandchildren, Michael and his wife, Susie Sims, and Daniel Sims, Lyla, Peter, Eve, Ivy and Grace Smerchinski and Ella Sims, Josh and his wife, Megan Perovic; and his great-grandchildren, Kiera, Declan and Alina Sims, and Kazimira and Johnathan Perovic.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Peter obtained his Bachelor of Commerce Degree from <span class="companylink">McGill University</span> in 1955 and his LL.B. from Osgoode Hall in 1959. After being called to the bar in 1959, Peter joined his father in his law practice, which had been established by his grandfather in 1889 and which over the years grew and bore names including Sims McKinnon, Sims McKinnon Varey Griggs and Trafford, and Sims Clement Eastman and later merged with the national law firm Miller Thomson. Peter was managing partner of the law firm for many years. He was appointed Queen's Counsel in 1972.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He was also the successful owner and chairman of Chicopee Manufacturing for 30 years, until selling it to <span class="companylink">Magellan Aerospace Corporation</span> in 1998.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Peter served as a director and later chairman of the Economical Mutual Insurance Company for almost 30 years and also as a director and chairman of the Missisquoi & Rouville Insurance Company and the Waterloo Insurance Company. He served as president of the Waterloo Law Association and the Kitchener Chamber of Commerce.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In addition to his significant philanthropy, his volunteer contribution also included serving as a board member and chairman of the University of Waterloo's Board of Governors and the Freeport Hospital Foundation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In addition to numerous executive positions on other various charitable organizations, he served as president of the Kitchener Young Men's Club, the Kitchener Federal and Provincial Liberal Riding Association, and Sunbeam Home.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Peter received an honorary Doctor of Laws degree from the <span class="companylink">University of Waterloo</span> in 1999, which was a tribute to his important contribution to the university and also to his father's legacy as a founding member of <span class="companylink">University of Waterloo</span>'s Board of Governors. His philanthropic gifts to the university included gifts for the creation of the Peter and Betty Sims Reading Room. The Sims Student Study Galleria in the Davis Centre Library was named in his honour.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As important as his career and his community involvement, Peter was devoted to his wife and best friend Betty. They enjoyed their life together and their large family with family dinners, entertaining friends with dinners and parties, talking and telling stories for hours, trips and their shared interest in Chicopee Manufacturing. When their youngest daughter entered grade one, Peter supported Betty in beginning her business career at the family aerospace company Chicopee Manufacturing Limited. As her career flourished and in addition to his successful law practice and board work, Peter gradually took over cooking dinner for the family and over time cooking became his domain and a real joy for him and the family.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The family is grateful for the care provided by Peter's caregivers which supported him in living independently in the home that he had moved into with Betty when they were first married until his final days.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With the rise of niche ETFs, there is seemingly an exchange-traded fund for everything.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That includes an ETF for Western Canadian Select, the heavyoil benchmark that made headlines last week when it tumbled to less than US$14 a barrel. Not surprisingly, the Canadian Crude Index ETF (CCX-T) has plummeted in tandem.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Created in 2015 by Calgarybased Auspice Capital Advisors Ltd., CCX tracks an index that was “designed to provide returns that reflect the price of owning crude oil that is produced in Canada," specifically WCS, according to company documents.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The ensuing years have been a struggle. At launch, WCS traded hands at around US$50 a barrel; now, WCS is about US$15, a reflection of continuing troubles in the oil patch.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The ETF has plunged about 77 per cent since inception, as of Friday's close.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Granted, the fund is not widely held, with total assets of around $11-million, nor widely traded, save for a recent increase in volume. But in an age of abundant ETF options for retail investors, the situation does highlight the inherent risks of niche funds with a narrow – or in this case, singular – focus.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The number of Canadian-listed ETFs has exploded in recent years. At the end of 2017, there were 667 structured products – mostly ETFs – listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange, nearly double the 338 listings at the end of 2008.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Over the same span, the number of listings for operating companies declined to 834 from 1,232.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Those trends have spilled into 2018. Through the first 10 months of the year, 88 new ETFs have been listed on the TSX, compared with nine corporate IPOs, according to <span class="companylink">TMX Group</span>. The new funds track everything from small-cap cannabis companies to firms involved in the development of blockchain technologies.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And Sunday's Grey Cup showdown – Ottawa vs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Calgary – is shaping up as a metaphor for the duelling economic narratives playing out across the country.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On the one hand, there is Ottawa: flush with tax revenue and in spend mode as the national economy runs near full tilt, corporate profits surge and unemployment hovers at lows not seen since the 1970s.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For now, at least, conditions are hot enough for the <span class="companylink">Bank of Canada</span> to continue hiking interest rates to cool things down.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Then, there's Alberta: rapidly becoming a have-not province. Energy-dependent Alberta is in full-blown crisis mode as crude prices sink to new lows and inventories swell in the face of pipeline bottlenecks and too much supply. And the province is looking to Ottawa for handouts, most notably to subsidize the purchase of rail-tanker cars to haul oil.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It has been a dramatic reversal of fortunes. The Alberta government now faces a devastating loss of up to $4-billion in energy royalties in 2019 because of the record price gap between Western Canadian heavy crude and the main North American benchmark, exacerbating an already worsening fiscal situation, according to an analysis by the <span class="companylink">Bank of Nova Scotia</span>. That represents a potential loss up to $950 for every Albertan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Canada's richest province, which had zero debt as recently as the 2015-16 fiscal year, is on a track to have more debt relative to its size than profligate Ontario by 2042. Alberta and Manitoba are now on “dangerous long-term debt trajectories that could significantly compromise their economic growth prospects and place substantial burdens on the backs of future generations," according to a blog post this week by the Vancouver-based <span class="companylink">Fraser Institute</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Federal Finance Minister Bill Morneau walked into the economic divide with this week's Fall Economic Update, a sort of minibudget. Mr. Morneau acknowledged the “challenges" facing the oil and gas sector in a speech in the Commons. But he offered no special help for the oil patch as he talked up the country's “strong and growing economy." Mr. Morneau pointed out that “because the economy is doing well, we … have the fiscal room to continue to follow through on the commitments we made to Canadians."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The federal government is forecasting a declining budget deficit through to 2023-24. But it's letting those deficits run higher by spending part of the dividend from the strong economy on various measures, including nearly $600-million for the ailing news media and enhanced tax writeoffs on business capital expenditures, such as software and plant machinery. But there was no money for rail cars, prompting howls of protest from the Alberta government. Western Canadian oil producers are struggling to move their oil to refineries in the United States because existing pipelines are full and new projects remain stalled by legal and regulatory delays.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The hundreds of angry protesters who greeted Mr. Trudeau in Calgary, demanding action, suggest that Albertans, at least, do not see an economy that is doing “well."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Like Mr. Morneau, Mr. Trudeau offered empathy, but no firm commitments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“There is no question that folks in Alberta, folks here in Calgary, are living through extremely difficult times … ," Mr. Trudeau said. “I hear that very, very clearly."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To be fair, the federal government is already heavily invested in Canada's oil sector. Ottawa has committed roughly $12billion to purchase and expand the Trans Mountain pipeline to get Alberta crude to foreign markets via Burnaby, B.C.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For now, the pain of the oil-price squeeze is contained mainly to Alberta. It's a case of two economic solitudes – one grim, one more hopeful.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the longer Alberta's crisis lasts, the greater the risk that these duelling economic storylines will eventually collide, spreading the damage to the rest of the country. The TorontoDominion Bank estimates that if crude prices remain stuck at current levels it would knock half a percentage-point a year off economic growth nationally.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Grey Cup odds, at least, suggest Alberta is poised to inflict pain on the rest of the country. The Calgary Stampeders are four-point favourites over the Ottawa Redblacks in Sunday's game.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">Health Canada</span>'s 2018 Canadian Cannabis Survey, released this week, provides an overview of the consumption habits of recreational and medical users before the drug was legalized last month.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The survey involved 12,958 random people from across the country between May and July, with 3,395 respondents indicating they had used the drug in the past year. Nearly half that number (1,706) said they were using it medicinally.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jack Lloyd, a lawyer in Toronto who specializes in cannabis cases, said the new data show patients still don't have faith in Canada's medical marijuana system. Mr. Lloyd is part of a B.C. Supreme Court case arguing many patients turn to the illicit market to get edibles and high-potency concentrates that work for them because they don't know how to make these products themselves and they still can't get them through legal channels. Only the sale of dried flower or cannabis oils through government-licensed stores or licensed producers is legal, with legislation on edibles not expected until next year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The government was told that the restriction to dried flower was unconstitutional," Mr.Lloyd said, referencing the unanimous 2015 <span class="companylink">Supreme Court of Canada</span> decision that enshrined the right of medical-marijuana users to consume the drug in ways other than smoking.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The survey found nearly a third (30 per cent) of all those who said they used the drug as a medicine sourced it from a friend. Another 28 per cent reported getting their marijuana from an illicit dispensary and a further 13 per cent of respondents said they bought the substance from an illegal online dispensary or a drug dealer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The only legal option – the federal government's Access to Cannabis for Medical Purposes program – was used by 24 per cent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">Health Canada</span>'s latest national data show doctors had signed off on more than 330,000 prescriptions for medical marijuana since the system was created in 2014, but the agency doesn't break out how many of these patients are counted more than once after changing doctors or prescriptions and signing up again.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Medical marijuana has the most participants in Ontario, where 143,321 authorizations had been completed, followed closely by Alberta with 117,347. B.C., long the heart of the country's sizable underground cannabis economy, has seen only 12,820 prescriptions up over this time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Eric Morrissette, <span class="companylink">Health Canada</span>'s head of communications, said the number of registrations grew 10 per cent over the past year. He said it was a good thing that the number of respondents who said they got their cannabis from a dealer decreased from 22 per cent in last year's survey to 13 per cent this year. He also noted respondents were asked where they expected to get cannabis once it was legalized. The majority said from licensed avenues with only 16 per cent saying from someone sharing with them and 5 per cent from another illegal source.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The annual survey covers four themes: knowledge, attitudes and behaviours; cannabis use and products used; driving and cannabis, and cannabis for medical purposes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of the 1,126 people agreeing to answer more of <span class="companylink">Health Canada</span>'s questions about their consumption habits, 81 per cent said they used dried flowers and 30 per cent said they consumed edibles. Another 14 per cent said they bought cannabis oil from a licensed producer, while roughly the same percentage said they bought solid concentrates such as shatter and liquid products for vaping.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Canada is living an energy nightmare.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Its major oil producers have been expanding capacity for years under the assumption they are operating in a sophisticated country equipped with the regulatory framework and political maturity required to build a major export pipeline of great national interest in under, say, two decades.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But that assumption has proven invalid, and so now there's a glut of crude in Alberta that is selling at a discount of more than US$30 per barrel compared to the price for U.S.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">crude, which has easy access to markets. At times the discount has hit US$50, a previously unheard of gap between Canadian and North American prices. The Western Canada Select benchmark price slumped below US$13 this month, the lowest in a decade, while the U.S. benchmark remained above US$50.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Artificially low prices for Canadian crude are costing producers as much as $100-million a day in lost revenue, according to one frustrated oil company CEO. That figure might be high, but the damage is no less real for being estimated more conservatively. Alberta Premier Rachel Notley says the loss to the Canadian economy stands at $80-million a day. Choose your poison.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The main reason for this disastrous situation is the lack of pipeline capacity – capacity that has been repeatedly promised by federal governments of various stripes, but has not been delivered. The pressure to find an alternate solution is growing faster than the pressure inside the storage tanks holding all that unsellable Alberta heavy crude.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Which explains why, last week, the Trudeau government said it would consider a proposal from Alberta to buy rail cars to ship the province's landlocked surplus to export.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The cars would come online next summer and run for three years, at a total cost of $2.6-billion. They would move 120,000 barrels a day; the two governments would recoup as much as $2-billion by charging oil companies for the service.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's come to this, has it? After waking up one day to find themselves the owners of the Trans Mountain pipeline, which Ottawa purchased this year for $4.5-billion from an exasperated <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span>, now Canadians might become the owner/operators of an oil-by-rail concern? Why don't we just nationalize the whole industry and get it over with?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Canada's pipeline follies continue to be such a disheartening spectacle. Putting taxpayers on the hook for the latest round of desperate measures is not ideal, though we can't blame the Alberta government for seeking immediate solutions. Voters there want something – anything – done about a set of circumstances that is shortchanging oil companies, workers and the economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There is a useful irony in the rail idea, though. The major issue that opponents of pipelines overlook is that Alberta oil is going to move one way or another. If it can't travel down a pipe, then it will be loaded onto trucks and train cars.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This is not theoretical. The <span class="companylink">National Energy Board</span> reported last week that crude-by-rail exports from Canada rose to a record 269,829 barrels per day in September – double what it was a year ago. A cheaper and far safer alternative – the Trans Mountain expansion – sits unbuilt while oil still finds its way to markets on rail lines that intersect the main streets of Canadian cities and towns.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But is there a global oil scarcity because some Canadian crude is landlocked and Alberta is suffering? No. Is the lack of Trans Mountain expansion reducing the amount of driving people are doing in Vancouver? Or in Asia? No. Does the fact the Energy East pipeline was never built mean that people in Atlantic Canada and Quebec have no gasoline for their cars?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nope. Oil simply arrives in the East in tankers from Africa, the United States and the Middle East, including the bonesawing regime in Saudi Arabia.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There is a good chance Alberta oil will get a break in the new year. <span class="companylink">OPEC</span> is likely to announce a cut in production in December. Other countries, including the United States, have already started reducing output. <span class="companylink">Enbridge</span>'s Line 3 replacement project, which upgrades an existing pipe to the United States, could come onstream late in 2019. All of that will help.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But there will still be a significant gap between Canadian oil output and oil export capacity – the source of the price discount. The only solution is for Ottawa to focus on getting the Trans Mountain expansion approved in the shortest time possible. Just get it done.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Considered a sure thing only a couple of weeks ago, doubts are beginning to emerge about whether the central bank will hike in January without a rebound in slumping prices for Canadian heavy crude. In reports over the past 24 hours, <span class="companylink">Toronto-Dominion Bank</span> and <span class="companylink">Bank of Montreal</span> have put asterisks on their calls for a move, while swaps trading suggests investors are also paring bets.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Western Canada Select - the main blend sold by the oilsands - closed at US$13.46 a barrel on Nov. 15, the lowest in Bloomberg data stretching back to 2008. Its discount to U.S. benchmark crude exploded to as much as US$52.40 a barrel last month, also a record.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bank of Canada Governor Stephen Poloz has increased the policy rate five times since mid-2017, amid a strong economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">DePratto said by phone that Poloz will have to "acknowledge" the strains on the industry at the central bank's next rate decision on Dec. 5. Despite the caution, TD is anticipating oil prices will recover and the <span class="companylink">Bank of Canada</span> will raise rates in January.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Canada's heavy crude discount could narrow to around US$20 a barrel over the next few quarters as temporary supply problems fade, DePratto said in his note. That would allow the <span class="companylink">Bank of Canada</span> to focus on strength outside the energy industry that has pushed inflation above its two-per-cent target.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">BMO chief economist Doug Porter said he would consider cancelling a call for a January hike if Canadian oil discounts persist, adding some investors are underestimating the risks. "The spread is so extreme, the cries of pain from Alberta are so loud, I don't think they can just put blinders on and carry on as if nothing's changed," Porter said Thursday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Others remain confident there is a strong case for tighter policy in January. Energy is a smaller share of the economy than in 2015 when a bigger crash led to rate cuts, and the central bank's favoured survey of business conditions signals healthy growth, according to RBC economist Josh Nye.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The focus is going to remain on the national picture, but it's a tough balancing act when some provinces aren't doing as well," Nye said Thursday.</p>

</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Energy officials want to know how Trudeau, along with the provincial government, will fix the massive discount pounding Canadian oil prices because of a lack of pipeline capacity in the country.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Notley government also is disappointed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It hasn't been told if Trudeau's government will help bankroll the purchase of new locomotives to increase oil-by-rail shipments out of Alberta.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And a group of 2,000 protesters marching outside a downtown hotel where the prime minister was speaking Thursday afternoon had their own message for him about the Trans Mountain project.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Build that pipe," the crowd roared.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Everywhere he turned, it seemed the country's prime minister was getting an earful from an increasingly angry, anxious and frustrated province.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And for good reason. Alberta is watching millions of dollars of non-renewable oil wealth evaporate daily because of the country's inability to build new pipelines.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Better depreciation rates for companies making capital investments - one of the key components in the Liberal government's fall economic update this week - are welcomed by Alberta's business sector.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But it isn't enough. "We are looking for more than that," Mark Scholz, president of the <span class="companylink">Canadian Association of Oilwell Drilling Contractors (CAODC)</span>, said Thursday morning after delivering a speech to his association that excoriated the government for fumbling the ball on getting pipelines built.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"That's not going to save us."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Such skepticism didn't stop the prime minister from promoting his accelerated capital cost allowances while visiting the city.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Trudeau gave a luncheon speech to the Calgary Chamber of Commerce where he acknowledged the difficulties facing the province and economic distress caused by Canadian oil selling at a steep discount to global prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The price of Western Canadian Select heavy oil sold for just US$16.42 a barrel on Wednesday, while West Texas Intermediate crude fetched $54.62 a barrel.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Trudeau called the situation a crisis, noted it is costing Canada an estimated $80 million a day.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The prime minister pointed out he met with energy leaders in Fort McMurray earlier this year, and they requested Ottawa expand market access for Canadian oil and improve the capital cost allowance rules so major investments can be deducted quickly.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ottawa bought a pipeline - the Trans Mountain oil line to the West Coast - and now has announced the tax changes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">However, a court ruling has since put Trans Mountain's expansion on hold and it's uncertain when the $7.4-billion project will be built.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Changing the depreciation rules for businesses won't make much difference if petroleum producers slash their capital programs next year because of the oil-price carnage.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The accelerating capital cost allowance doesn't matter if the differentials are where they are - because no one is going to spend any money," said Steve Laut, executive vice-chair of Canadian Natural Resources, the country's largest oil and gas producer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There's going to be no jobs."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Trudeau pointed out a number of U.S. oil refiners shut down for maintenance this fall. The discount should ease somewhat as they come back online and need more Canadian heavy crude.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet, there is a persistent glut of oil in Alberta and not enough take-away capacity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I know that even industry isn't entirely united on the best ways to move forward on how to fix this differential," Trudeau said, referring to a battle between producers who want the Notley government to curtail oil output, and refiners who believe market forces should resolve the issue.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pressed by chamber CEO Sandip Lalli for a federal response to the short-term differential woes, Trudeau had little to offer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's like you think there's a super-simple answer. There's not. This a multifaceted complex issue," he replied.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Look, everyone gets it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These are complicated issues.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There is no silver bullet, no simple answer, no quick fix - choose your cliché - to the pricing predicament for Canadian crude.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But here's another reality.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Liberal government chose to kill the Northern Gateway project, not Alberta or the oilpatch.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It was the federal government that messed up consultations with Indigenous communities over the Trans Mountain pipeline expansion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">His government needs to come up with remedies, not just drop by to share Alberta's pain, or wait for others to come up with a master plan to make it all better. It's called providing leadership.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There was not one single specific solution offered by the prime minister to the differential, just a promise to meet with the industry while waiting for legal and regulatory issues around Trans Mountain to be addressed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To his credit, Trudeau did sit down with a handful of energy executives after the speech to hear their concerns and suggestions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One idea from Alberta is for the federal government to team up with the province and buy locomotives that could get two large-unit trains moving more oil out of Alberta each day.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It would likely take months for the engines to arrive, but it would improve transportation capacity next year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a speech to the <span class="companylink">CAODC</span>, Premier Rachel Notley said the province will keep pushing its rail plan and "if Ottawa won't come to the table, then we'll get it done ourselves."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Asked about the matter, Trudeau never came close to touching the question of Ottawa chipping in to acquire locomotives.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There was a lot of generalities, a lot of, 'I'm looking into it and listening.'But there wasn't really anything concrete," said Chris Bloomer, chief executive of the Canadian Energy Pipeline Association.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We didn't really hear any solutions today," added Tim McMillan, president of the Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Scholz didn't stop by to hear the prime minister. He didn't miss a beat when asked what message Trudeau should take away from his visit to Calgary.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"This industry is in crisis and we are not looking for Band-Aid solutions at this point," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The lack of action on this file has been deafening."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After Thursday's performance, it grew only louder.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It has been a strange week in Calgary, all right. On Monday the city's council met to hear the official, mathematical bad news about the plebiscite on a 2026 Winter Olympics bid. Mayor Naheed Nenshi introduced an omnibus motion annihilating all the various committees, boards and secretariats involved in preparing the doomed project. He then made a strange proposal, putting it to his colleagues that he should advocate for Calgary to keep $20 million in funding from higher levels of government that had been set aside to pay for the bid. Even though there is no bid.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Council's response to Nenshi's suggestion was not, perhaps surprisingly, to call an ambulance and have a nurse check whether the mayor had suffered a stroke. Not at all. Council thought the idea of Calgary being paid for a Winter Olympics bid it has abandoned was ... not nearly ambitious enough.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Why, they asked, shouldn't Calgary have all of the money that other taxpayers were going to throw at it for holding an Olympics? Council immediately solemnized the motion, formally requesting "that the mayor advocate with the provincial and federal government to continue their Olympic and Paralympic funding commitments ..." It is almost as if Nenshi and his council thought that maybe no one would notice they had held the plebiscite. Or, indeed, that they could grub for the cash and hope that the other governments just forgot about it by the time 2026 rolled around.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The prime minister flew into Calgary on Thursday to meet with Mayor Nenshi, chat with the Chamber of Commerce, and have photos taken at the site of new social housing being built partly on Ottawa's dime. The PM left no word on what he thought of the whole "let's buy Calgary an Olympics without going to the trouble of having one" concept. There were unexpected distractions at every turn in Calgary, the main one being a fierce protest outside his temporary headquarters at the downtown Hyatt.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Herald's agreed-upon estimate of the size of the anti-Trudeau protest was two thousand people. I am not sure I trust their math, but at any rate the crowd was large enough to snarl traffic and intimidate the police. I say "crowd," but perhaps the word should be "crowds," because the protest was actually twofold.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The striking <span class="companylink">Canadian Union of Postal Workers</span> was there to discourage Trudeau from passing the back-to-work legislation his cabinet is cooking up. And there was also a coinciding protest over the landlocking of Alberta's oil, which has widened the spread between world oil prices and local spot prices to surreal, unimagined heights. The sluggishness of pipeline construction has left Alberta hydrocarbons all but worthless. And now the world price is tottering from medium-high levels, ending a sunshiny global oil season from which the province got no advantage.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The posties'chants of "Negotiate!" alternated with the militant oilpatch's cries of "Build that pipe!" In a way the spectacle was touching. Here, in the streets of Calgary, you had one of the most internationalist and red-dyed corners of Canadian organized labour literally joining forces with its mostly non-union, mostly right-wing working-class brethren. They said Trudeau was going to be a uniter, but what an accomplishment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This solidarity will, of course, be fleeting. CUPW, having played the Grinch successfully, will either cut a deal or take its medicine when the back-to-work law passes. But Calgary's resentment of Trudeau will not be so quick to evaporate - nor, perhaps, will the images of our young prime minister facing a display of active mass public hostility for the first time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The fact is that the death of Calgary's Olympic dream came at exactly the wrong moment for a visiting PM. The Calgarians who did want to time-travel to 1988 were outnumbered, but we know from electoral maps who they are. They're the city's wealthy grandees, STEM-folk, lawyers, and skilled workers, big property owners who remember '88 as a time of emergence from a bleak decade for their city. You cannot blame them too much for wanting the magic back, for having a cargo-cult belief in the socially energizing power of an Olympics.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Their hopes were extirpated, and along came Trudeau, expressing sympathy over the depressed Alberta oil prices as if they had been a cruel act of God. No one is buying it. Albertans remember Trudeau's role in killing the Northern Gateway pipeline tie to Kitimat, which had received conditional bureaucratic approval before he decided that its demise was one election promise he intended to keep.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">His intricate reforms to the environmental review process for infrastructure projects are thought to leave it even more delay-prone and cumbersome than the status quo - and, as a cute little bonus, they would transfer most of the bureaucratic work from Calgary to Ottawa. It may no longer be a question of Trudeau II unfairly inheriting the resentment Albertans felt toward Trudeau I: if things keep on like this, they may start wishing they could trade in the son and take the father back.</p>

However - that gesture of mercy aside - reality sees it otherwise, and we know it is the masterminds of the PMO who have brought the energy policy of our country to the total and possibly irredeemable mess that it now so very emphatically is.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The highlight of my news week was a story out of the East Coast, wherein I learned that in a cull of superfluous moose, the federal department was paying out the tidy sum of $7,900 a head. And that in a week when one grade of Canadian oil was racking up the heady purchase price of $7.50 a barrel. Now I love moose as much as the next hominid (especially when packaged as sausages) but an economy that supports $8,000 moose, and a barrel of oil at 1/1000th the cost, is not perfectly secure. (Perhaps I should be careful in associating these two topics. For if the animal rights crowd and the green furies were to band together, there would be such a stampede of sanctimony as to blot out the sun and hurl the lesser planets from their natural orbits.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Elsewhere, we hear from Premier Rachel Notley of her province forgoing $80 million a day because Alberta oil, weathering the worse downturn in a decade, and after the calamitous fire in Fort McMurray, is being held hostage, in an economic chokehold, by the lack of any outward access to world markets. Companies and capital have been in full flight from the province, thousands of workers displaced and unemployed, and less real government attention is being paid to a province in full crisis than to the now ritual apology-of-the-week from the leadership in Ottawa.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is past time to reverse the onus of the policy debate on Canada's energy industry.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Until there are pipelines (plural) built and oil flowing to international markets there should be no talk of the so-call carbon tax - the energy tax. Until the crazed circumstance of the blockade on Alberta energy is resolved, all talk of "reducing carbon emissions" and the pretence of meeting our Paris "commitments" should be shelved. Fix the home front first, and then if some wish to attend to the dubious goals of planetary salvation, let them at it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Secondly, reverse the onus on jobs and development. Why do those who offer development, technology and jobs have to stagger through years of hearings, assessments, protests, court cases and appeals, to get permission to supply a basket of incontestable benefits? Considering the egregious state of the Canadian energy industry, the farce/folly of the price differentials for Canadian oil versus U.S. or world prices, the notion that it is the energy industry and those who work in it, who have to make the concessions, bow to the spaghetti tangle of regulations, is plainly ludicrous.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">How ludicrous? Well, one company spent seven years in the assessment marshlands trying to twin a pipeline, with its own money, and finally, exhausted, said enough. That's the story of Trans Mountain - which the Liberal government then had to buy to save political face, and assume responsibility for what the private sector was eager to do originally. The proposed pipeline, of course, is still stalled. The story of Trans Mountain is the sad parable of the whole industry.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I think we must "reverse the current" in this discussion. Let the burden of assessment fall to the oppositional voices. Why shouldn't this be built? Why should we not start a project that will employ thousands of Canadians? Why do they not support Aboriginal groups who have signed on to projects? If there are protesters, ask: What are they offering? What are protesters bringing to the table that merits giving them standing with the principals? There should be an audit on the "downstream emissions" of environmental protest. It would include: Billions of dollars in revenues lost from projects that were halted.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tens of thousands of jobs that never materialized.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Towns that will languish from unemployment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Capital investments that will fail to come to Canada because of the hostility to enterprise generated by irresponsible protest.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And most significantly, a single instance of a global industry - Alberta oil and gas - being made the villain of an entire global campaign.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Thirdly, it is time for Alberta to play hardball on this file. Niceness is a great thing, and I agree it is something of a genuine Canadian virtue. But niceness, the spirit of compromise, the efforts to buy "social licence," have all come to nothing. The oil is still under blockade, a cardinal element of the Canadian economy is being held hostage, revenues in the billions of dollars are being lost to the treasuries of Alberta and Ottawa, and the international reputation of Canadian business is in tatters.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To end, there should be a new equation: No carbon taxes anywhere till Canada sees new pipelines and oil flowing at sane prices to international markets.</p>

</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*  Methodology How we did the data analysis [https://www.theglobeandmail.com/canada/article-how-the-globe-analyzed-thousands-of-inactive-well-sites/]
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To learn about the buyers and a growing roster of middlemen, Globe and Mail reporters Jeffrey Jones, Jeff Lewis and Nathan VanderKlippe spoke to oil executives, lawyers and investment bankers. They even plunked themselves down in the lobby of one Chinese-backed company until someone agreed to speak to them through an interpreter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Lewis drove to a residential address on the outskirts of Calgary that was listed as the headquarters of a striking number of the firms. Finding no one at the large but seemingly neglected house, he knocked on the door of a neighbour to glean some information. He was greeted by pro wrestling legend Bret (the Hitman) Hart. Mr. Hart said he knew nothing of the owners and suggested making inquiries at a nearby liquor store. It was a dead end.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Globe and Mail turned to corporate registries and regulatory filings to show, in an article published in May, 2017[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/industry-news/energy-and-resources/chinese-investment-alberta-oil-deals/article35061644/] , how a handful of groups were buying up distressed assets at a time when the Canadian industry, battered by weak oil and gas prices, was only too happy to sell.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The story didn’t end there. In the ensuing months, the same corporate names kept reappearing in acquisitions of oil and gas wells, some with the same managers and directors. Their ultimate ownership was often difficult to track. At least one of the companies, we found, was a subsidiary, several times removed[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/industry-news/energy-and-resources/calgary-oil-firm-buying-energy-assets-is-backed-by-chinese-state/article37714453/] , of the government of the People’s Republic of China. Others used funds routed through the British Virgin Islands. We also found that it wasn’t just overseas money being funnelled into distressed assets; there was also brisk deal-making by domestic buyers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In March, 2018, one of the companies with ties to the suburban Calgary home, Sequoia Resources, collapsed into receivership, leaving creditors, including several municipalities and the Alberta Energy Regulator, out millions of dollars – the AER in the form of unfunded cleanup costs for thousands of oil and gas wells. There were warning signs of Sequoia’s perilous financial state. But the regulator kept approving deals – and sometimes broke its own rules – as better-financed energy companies offloaded their unwanted wells and associated environmental obligations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sequoia’s collapse propelled The Globe to take a deeper look at the trade of aging wells in Western Canada. We conducted dozens of interviews, visited farmers and municipal offices in Alberta and Saskatchewan and pored over company reports and documents obtained through the courts and freedom of information laws. Globe data journalist Chen Wang analyzed the databases of oil and gas wells in Alberta, Saskatchewan and British Columbia to piece together, among other things, how many wells have changed hands since the oil-price crash and who has been trading the distressed assets. In all, the records contained more than 600,000 wells, of which 20 per cent are inactive. The Globe’s analysis offers the most comprehensive look at activity in Western Canada’s oil patch.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Through these threads, we found more Sequoias and a weak regulatory environment that has failed to curb many questionable deals. At the same time, the number of inactive, abandoned and orphaned wells in Western Canada that require cleanup and reclamation has ballooned to more than 210,000. A financial and environmental crisis could be looming if companies that recently acquired thousands of aging wells keep going bust. As one frustrated Saskatchewan farmer told editor Renata D’Aliesio: “It’s too easy for these people to buy a company or properties and not worry about the liability.… We will have a big mess – until the government comes in and cleans it up.”</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Oil got hammered on the markets today, plunging nearly 8 per cent[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/business/article-oil-prices-hit-year-low-as-opec-considers-output-cut/] on continued concerns about a rising global surplus. Producers are considering cutting output to curb supply. The <span class="companylink">Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries</span> meets on Dec. 6 and is expected to announce cuts to output. Prices have dropped more than 20 per cent so far in November. Its effect has been particularly acute in Alberta’s oil sands, where price of Alberta heavy crude has crashed owing in part to a shortage of pipeline capacity and temporary closings at refineries. On Thursday, the Alberta government asked the federal government for help to move more of the province’s oil by rail[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/business/article-trudeau-gives-speech-in-calgary-amid-slumping-price-for-alberta-oil/] , but Prime Minister Justin Trudeau offered no immediate aid for the industry, although he recognized it was in “a crisis.” While the price of Alberta heavy crude is expected to recover by spring, Ms. Notley and Mr. Trudeau said the Canadian economy is losing $80-million a day.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economics reporter Barrie McKenna weighs in on the “crisis,” as Mr. Trudeau called it, pointing out this epic clash of economic narratives[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/business/commentary/article-ottawa-vs-calgary-an-epic-clash-of-economic-narratives-on-grey-cup/] falls on Grey Cup weekend" “It’s Canada’s new economic divide. And Sunday’s Grey Cup showdown – Ottawa vs. Calgary – is shaping up as a metaphor for the duelling economic narratives playing out across the country.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More on oil’s troubles: A niche ETF for Western Canadian Select, the heavy-oil benchmark that made headlines last week when it tumbled to less than US$14 a barrel, has plummeted. The Canadian Crude Index ETF (CCX-T), created by Calgary-based <span class="companylink">Auspice Capital Advisors Ltd</span>., has plunged about 78 per cent[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/investing/markets/inside-the-market/article-theres-an-etf-tracking-alberta-oil-prices-its-not-going-well/] since its 2015 inception.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Derek Burney, a former Canadian ambassador to the United States and a former director of TransCanada Corp., argues in a column that Alberta’s oil problem is Canada’s problem[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/opinion/article-albertas-oil-problem-is-canadas-problem/] . “Alberta’s energy sector is hurting severely but few in the rest of Canada seem to care. What had been a locomotive for growth both in the province and the country is reeling under the combined pressure of collapsing oil prices and policy paralysis.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, Gary Mason weighed in on Alberta’s reliance on the energy industry[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/opinion/article-whats-the-economic-plan-b-for-alberta-there-isnt-one/] : “A peer-reviewed study[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41558-018-0182-1.epdf] published this summer in the journal Nature Climate Change predicts that advances in cheaper, clean technology will begin killing fossil-fuel demand in the next 15 to 20 years – or sooner. It suggests that oil-exporting countries, including Canada, will see a steep decline in their output and consequently will experience massive layoffs. ... I mention this against the backdrop of what is happening currently in this country, and in particular, in Alberta. ... All anyone is talking about is the need for more pipelines, as if that alone will solve the province’s problems.”</p>

<span class="companylink">Ontario PC</span> party to pay for Doug Ford’s $25,000 private jet trip through Northern Ontario</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Globe and Mail has learned the Ontario Progressive Conservative Party paid for the use of a private plane[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/canada/article-ontario-pc-party-to-pay-for-doug-fords-25000-private-jet-trip/] that was used to transport Premier Doug Ford and his team during a three-day visit to northern Ontario. As Laura Stone and Karen Howlett report, The Globe obtained documents that show top staffers in Mr. Ford’s office arranged a charter aircraft, using private e-mails, for the Premier’s recent visit at a cost of $25,000. Now, while taxpayers may grin at not being billed, critics are pointing out how odd it is that a political party would pay for a government trip during which Mr. Ford made several public appearances and his office issued government news releases.

The <span class="companylink">Canadian Union of Postal Workers</span> and the <span class="companylink">Canadian Labour Congress</span> condemned the move and suggested the Liberal government is now at odds with the labour movement. “The mail was moving, and people know it,” said CUPW president Mike Palecek. “People have been getting their mail and online orders delivered.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jagmeet Singh says he still intends to run in a federal by-election in British Columbia’s Burnaby South even though a friendlier riding in his hometown of Brampton, Ont., has suddenly opened up. Yesterday, Liberal Raj Grewal announced his resignation[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/politics/article-politics-briefing-liberal-mp-leaves-suddenly-for-serious-personal/] , leaving open a riding that Mr. Singh would likely win. The choice of Burnaby South will be a harder challenge -- the NDP won the riding in 2015 by 500 votes. Prime Minister Trudeau is expected to set an early February date for the by-election in Burnaby South and at least two other vacant ridings, something Ottawa columnist Campbell Clark says shows a whole whack of cynicism at play[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/politics/article-trudeaus-by-election-moves-are-naked-cynicism/] .</p>

The pair was escorted out of work by police on Tuesday. In a letter addressed to the three House leaders who agreed to the actions at the request of Speaker of the House Darryl Plecas, Vancouver lawyer Mark Andrews wrote that Mr. Lenz and Mr. James were expelled in a "deliberately public and humiliating manner” and their reputations “are in the process of being destroyed,” the Canadian Press reports. Last night, The Globe’s Justine Hunter in the B.C. bureau filed a piece highlighting some of the odd things happening in the B.C. legislature: Speaker Darryl Plecas tried to install his political aide and personal friend[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/canada/british-columbia/article-bc-liberals-accuse-speaker-of-trying-to-install-his-friend-in-security/] Alan Mullen as the replacement for Sergeant-at-Arms Lenz.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The saying goes, never bring a knife to a gunfight. But on Wednesday, four jewelry thieves and three jewelry store workers turned that idiom on its head. Several surveillance cameras ( click through to watch the video[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/canada/article-mississauga-jewellery-store-workers-fight-off-would-be-thieves-with/] on the article page) recorded the attempted robbery. An SUV screeched to a halt at the corner of Beverley Street and Airport Road in Mississauga, Ont., and four people jumped out and smashed their way through the jewelry store’s window with a large hammer. But as two of the attempted robbers tried to crawl through the window, the store clerks fought them off with swords. One suspect then pointed a gun through the window, but the gun did not discharge. The four suspects then fled. Store owner Baldev Manjania said he thought his wife was going to be shot during the robbery, so he grabbed a sword and fought the suspects off. “I went to get my sword because I had to do something to save my family,” he said.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">PSA: Black Friday is terrible</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Where Boxing Day always felt like an adventure in spending gift cards and Christmas money with friends after days of family-only extravaganzas (and still does, let me have this), Black Friday became the capitalist Hunger Games. By courting long lines to amplify the demand for extremely limited deals, stores pit customers against each other. And then, to highlight the frenzy the day ends up breeding (see footage of people running into Walmarts or Best Buys), those same customers are often videotaped and laughed at, as though trying to buy something at an affordable price is a punchline. As if the working class responding to the one day they’ve been given to buy what they’ve been told their worth hinges on is hilarious. As if the pressure we put on everyone to create the perfect holiday via rabid consumerism isn’t the result of a system that sets up the majority to fail.” –  Anne T.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For boys, all-male environments can be an abusive, toxic place</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“… boys who are abused often don’t speak up or ask for help for fear that being a victim will make them appear unmanly or weak. Homophobia is central to this. Straight boys are afraid of being perceived as gay, and gay and bisexual boys worry that they will be outed or blamed if they talk about their abuse. All-male, fraternal environments such as boys-only schools, sports teams and fraternities magnify these gender dynamics and biases. British psychotherapist Joy Schaverien coined the term “boarding school syndrome”[http://www.joyschaverien.com/boarding-school-syndrome/] to describe how exclusive, hierarchical boys’ academies such as Eton and Harrow teach young men to be bullies, to be loyal to their clique-ish institution and disdainful of “the other,” to bury their emotions and take pride in their capacity to endure pain, to feel entitled and to dominate those weaker than themselves.” — Rachel Giese, author of Boys: What it Means to Become a Man</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Harry’s message was that the monuments of progress – the hospitals and schools and social safety net – were not permanent and inevitable. They’d been fought for and built by men and women, in living memory, and they were under threat. This is what had roused him from comfortable retirement in his 90s to become a one-man living history tour, an author and advocate railing against corporate greed, cynical politics and voter apathy. I interviewed him for the first time shortly after I heard him speak, and asked him if he wasn’t just a tiny bit tired of waging this endless battle. He laughed (although “laugh-wheezed” might be a better way of putting it.) “Oh no,” he said. “I’m going out of this world fighting.” " — Elizabeth Renzetti[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/opinion/article-the-lessons-of-harry-leslie-smith-the-fight-never-ends/]

(“NACG” or “the Company”) (TSX:NOA.TO/NYSE:NOA) announced today an upsized $300 million Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (the “Credit Facility”) with its banking syndicate led by National Bank Financial.

The Credit Facility is consistent with existing terms, maintains attractive rates and provides sufficient flexibility to allow for the $199 million asset transaction to close immediately.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Credit Facility more than doubles NACG’s borrowing capacity to $300 million with an ability to increase the maximum borrowings by an additional $50 million, subject to certain customary conditions. It is also important to note that in addition to the upgraded credit facility borrowing capacity, the equipment financing limit has been increased to $150 million up from $100 million allowing for additional borrowing flexibility. The term of the Credit Facility is committed for three years and matures on November 23, 2021, with an option to extend on an annual basis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Credit Facility is comprised solely of a revolver with no scheduled repayments and is not governed by a borrowing base that limits available borrowings. Financial covenants are consistent with the previous agreement and are tested quarterly on a trailing four quarter basis. The Credit Facility covenants are in full compliance at time of closing and have been established in consideration of the asset purchase agreement with Aecon.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In addition to the new Credit Facility, the Company recently entered into a 25-year $19.9 million mortgage with <span class="companylink">Business Development Bank of Canada</span> (“BDC”), which will be drawn upon to cover costs already incurred in relation to the Company’s recent acquisition of land and construction of its maintenance facility and head office complex in Acheson, Alberta.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Stocks to ponder</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">Superior Plus Corp</span>. ( SPB-T[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/investing/markets/stocks/SPB-T/] ). The stock has been trading in a relatively narrow range between $10.50 and $13.50 for the past two years, but the company’s high dividend yield – currently 6.9 per cent – should be taken in to account whenever looking at the low price volatility. RSI buy signals have had a mixed record in uncovering profitable entry points for Superior Plus. The stock was frequently oversold by RSI during the May to July 2017 period before finally rallying 19 per cent from early August 2017 to October 27, 2017. A November 2017 buy signal was ineffective as the price continued lower until another buy signal in February of this year. After that, the price climbed another 19 per cent to mid-May. More recently, a buy signal near the end of October was also ineffective. RSI buy signals have not provided enough reliable entry points for Superior Plus in the past two years to trust the current one. This is also a case where fundamental research is even more important than usual – any investor considering buying Superior Plus for the dividend and riding out the current downdraft needs to be absolutely certain that the income payments stay at current levels. Scott Barlow explains in this week’s most overbought and oversold stocks on the TSX[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/investing/markets/inside-the-market/article-the-weeks-most-oversold-and-overbought-stocks-on-the-tsx-24/] .

<span class="companylink">Tervita Corp</span>. ( TEV-T[https://beta.theglobeandmail.com/investing/markets/stocks/TEV-T/] ). This stock that appears on the positive breakouts list. In recent weeks, the share price has been rallying while the S&P/TSX Composite Index has been faltering. The share price has increased 38 per cent in the past two weeks. The stock has seven unanimous buy recommendations[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/investing/markets/inside-the-market/article-thursdays-tsx-breakouts-a-stock-on-the-rise-with-7-buy-calls-and-a/] with a 33-per-cent gain expected over the next 12 months. Alberta-based Tervita is an environmental services provider. After the market closed on Nov. 14, the company reported better-than-expected third quarter financial results that sent the share price soaring 8 per cent the next trading day.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">Savaria Corp</span>. ( SIS-T[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/investing/markets/stocks/SIS-T/] ). This stock appeared on the negative breakouts list earlier this week with the share price closing at its lowest level since mid-2017. Earlier this month, the company reported quarterly earnings results that came in well below the Street’s expectations, sending the share price down nearly 19 per cent the following trading day. The stock is now trading at a valuation below its historical average and is technically in oversold territory[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/investing/markets/inside-the-market/article-fridays-tsx-breakouts-the-price-of-this-dividend-stock-plunges-with/] . The CEO of the company has stepped into the market, buying nearly $1-million worth of shares on the price weakness. The Street is anticipating the share price will rebound over the next year with a 42 per cent gain anticipated.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Betting on themselves: U.S. share buybacks hit record high in 3Q</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Corporations’ appetite  for buying back their own stock has hit a record high[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/investing/investment-ideas/article-betting-on-themselves-us-share-buybacks-hit-record-high-in-3q/] . Stock buybacks by companies in the benchmark S&P 500 index climbed to $194.07-billion in the third quarter, according to data from <span class="companylink">S&P Dow Jones Indices</span>. The buying spree, which has steadily increased since the second quarter of 2017, has been led by companies in the technology sector. Apple spent more than $80-billion on share buybacks through the first three quarters of this year. Chipmaker Qualcomm also bet big on its own stock, shelling out $21.2-billion in the third quarter.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A slippery trade: oil slump proves bears right</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The latest collapse in oil prices has proved some investors right in their lack of confidence in energy stocks this year[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/investing/investment-ideas/article-a-slippery-trade-oil-slump-proves-bears-right/] . Crude prices surged to a four-year high early in 2018 as tensions with Iran and <span class="companylink">OPEC</span> supply cuts raised concerns that global oil supply was dwindling. But the narrative has flipped since October as worries over a global trade war and rising U.S. shale oil production mounted, driving oil to a one-year low on Friday. Brent crude is down to $60 a barrel from a peak of $85 in early October. While oil majors have gone some way to cleaning up their balance sheets since the 2014 oil price collapse, their shares are still sensitive to moves in the underlying commodity - higher crude spells stronger revenues. When prices were climbing earlier this year, big banks were recommending investors buy back into the sector. Many, especially in Europe, followed that advice. But given the latest falls, some of those who sat on the sidelines believe their caution has been rewarded. Reuters reports.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Question: I’ve never contributed to my TFSA as I was a small-business owner for 26 years and we owned five homes over those years and paid the the maximum we could afford all the time. What amount can I put into a TFSA now? I’m in my 50s.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Answer: The TFSA was launched in 2009 with an annual contribution limit of $5,000. The limit remained at $5,000 for 2010, 2011 and 2012, rose to $5,500 for 2013 and 2014, jumped to $10,000 for 2015, then fell back to $5,500 for 2016, 2017 and 2018. An individual who was at least 18 when the TFSA was launched but has not deposited a dime into his or her TFSA would therefore have accumulated $57,500 of contribution room.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">From Notley urges Ottawa to help move oil as province eyes buying rail cars to break glut[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/business/article-trudeau-gives-speech-in-calgary-amid-slumping-price-for-alberta-oil/] by David Ebner</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nobody should be without a plan B, but boom-bust-echo economics has to end in Alberta. This means a national program to deal with our own energy needs and pipelines both east and west with refineries along the way. However this also requires a realization by all Canadians that carbon MUST be taxed and that a levy must be placed on some of its transmission that should go directly to solar, geothermal, and perhaps wind. Additionally lets get on with it. Harper didn't build one millimeter of pipeline and Trudeau bought one he cannot use. - bobPITA[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/business/article-trudeau-gives-speech-in-calgary-amid-slumping-price-for-alberta-oil/?commentId=af1abe17-0891-4804-ac9a-cd83e608b46d]
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Why are the oil companies not buying these tanker cars? Why do they expect the government to buy them instead? It is in the companies’ best interest to get the oil to market and at the highest price they can achieve. The tanker cars would allow them to do that. And they should be able to recover the costs quickly. As well, the new federal tax regulations would allow the companies to write off their costs much faster. Time to step up to the plate, oil industry. - ToryForever[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/business/article-trudeau-gives-speech-in-calgary-amid-slumping-price-for-alberta-oil/?commentId=d67b8d21-f69e-45a3-9ace-2614a4bc34f7]
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If only we had a way to move oil to tidewater without relying on rail. If only we could get oil to the east instead of relying on Saudi oil. I wonder what other countries do that have oil, and perhaps they could give us some ideas. Canada that land where ideas go to die, and where our government works hard at seeing just how much money they can lose on our natural resources. We should had started the pipelines by now, to the west coast and to the east, instead we lose billions, as the government figures out new ways to see just how poor we can become. - JeffSpooner[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/business/article-trudeau-gives-speech-in-calgary-amid-slumping-price-for-alberta-oil/?commentId=86a1a62c-f564-4f1a-89ac-2ecf30ba8c11]
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This won't address the current crisis and is a bit off topic but, as a long term solution, is it feasible to build and expand refining capacity in Alberta, thereby allowing export of the products as higher value added products, rather than to continue to sell the raw material below market value? That would also potentially retain high paying, high skill jobs in Canada rather than exporting those as well to the US.  - ozpcr[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/business/article-trudeau-gives-speech-in-calgary-amid-slumping-price-for-alberta-oil/?commentId=35ef0faa-e41a-4ddd-bc78-a6c55e7072a8]
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">we are into this mess because the politicians did not see the problems. Likewise we are not seeing the problems looming in other parts of the economy. Seeds are being sown for a general collapse. - Robert MacDiarmid[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/business/article-trudeau-gives-speech-in-calgary-amid-slumping-price-for-alberta-oil/?commentId=686c25ee-e841-4e27-9ae1-7f9c010690ab]
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Not sure what the governments cut is on a barrel of oil, but my preliminary calculations show there is no justifiable payback on a 3 billion investment in rail cars. - Expectationzs[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/business/article-trudeau-gives-speech-in-calgary-amid-slumping-price-for-alberta-oil/?commentId=c3c7e2b3-d34f-469f-baca-e2d6572bc28f]

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That brings to six[https://globalnews.ca/news/4689826/justin-trudeau-canada-byelections-jagmeet-singh/] the number of seats in the House of Commons that are or will soon be vacant.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Grewal’s resignation also presents a dilemma for NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh. Mr. Singh ran for party leader last year while sitting in the Ontario legislature. He has not yet won a seat at the federal level. Mr. Singh’s plan had been to win a seat in a soon-to-be-called by-election in Burnaby, B.C., on the other side of the country. But Mr. Grewal’s sudden resignation opens up an opportunity a lot closer to home: The riding boundaries of Brampton East are quite similar to the riding that Mr. Singh represented at a provincial level. While running in Burnaby was looking like a tough fight, running in Brampton might be more of a sure bet.</p>

</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CALGARY, Alberta, Nov. 23, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- <span class="companylink">Precision Drilling Corporation</span> (“Precision” or “the Company”) (TSX:PD; NYSE:PDS) today confirms its continued support for the strategic share exchange merger (the “Precision Transaction”) with <span class="companylink">Trinidad Drilling Ltd</span>. (“Trinidad”) (TSX:TDG) on the basis of 0.445 of a Precision common share (a “Precision Share”) for each Trinidad common share (a “Trinidad Share”).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Company strongly encourages Trinidad shareholders not to tender their Trinidad Shares to <span class="companylink">Ensign Energy Services Inc</span>’s. (“Ensign”) (TSX:ESI) opportunistic all cash take-over offer for all of the Trinidad Shares (the “Ensign Offer”), at near an all-time low value for Trinidad. Further, the Trinidad Board of Directors (“Trinidad Board”) has unanimously recommended that Trinidad shareholders REJECT the inadequate Ensign Offer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Trinidad shareholders do not need to take any action if they wish to NOT tender their Trinidad Shares. Trinidad shareholders that have questions or require assistance with withdrawing their Trinidad Shares which were tendered in error should contact Trinidad's Information Agent, D.F. King Canada, toll free at 1.866.521.4427 (212.771.1133 by collect call) or by email at inquiries@dfking.com[mailto:inquiries@dfking.com]. Trinidad and Precision shareholders will have the opportunity to vote for the Precision Transaction on December 11, 2018. If you are a beneficial shareholder that has not received your materials for the securityholder meetings to approve the Precision Transaction you are encouraged to contact your broker directly for information on how to vote your shares.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Precision Share price is positioned to benefit in the near-term from potential macro developments and Trinidad shareholders can participate in the potential upside by not accepting the Ensign Offer and voting in favor of the Precision Transaction. Strengthening natural gas prices, a potentially supportive OPEC meeting on December 6th, new Permian pipelines set to open in 2019 and 2020, and potential solutions to solve the challenged Canadian WCS spread are all expected to be near-term catalysts for Precision.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The acceleration by Ensign of the inadequate Ensign Offer, at a historically low value for Trinidad, seeks to deprive Trinidad shareholders the opportunity to properly consider the Precision Transaction and to deny Trinidad shareholders the value of time by forcing them to make a rash decision without the potential benefit of exposure to near-term positive macro events. The acceleration of the inadequate Ensign Offer benefits Ensign at the expense of Trinidad shareholders. Ensign has the ability to extend the timing of its offer to allow the Trinidad shareholders more time to consider the merits of the Precision Transaction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Precision’s President and CEO Kevin Neveu stated: “Precision’s operations continue to demonstrate strength and we see a number of positive catalysts as we survey the energy market outlook. We expect to generate significant free cash flow from our industry-leading rig fleet, supported by several billion dollars of capital investment this decade.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Current oilfield sector valuations are near decade-low valuations, and this does not appear to be the time to sell for cash. In fact, the Precision Board and management have been buying Precision Shares over the past month. By voting to combine with Precision, the Trinidad shareholders are well positioned to benefit from the strength of the combined company and the $52 million in annual synergies we expect to generate.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We remain committed to our offer and have had positive conversations about the combination’s value creation potential with both Trinidad and Precision shareholders. The superior Precision Transaction offers Trinidad shareholders a clear path to realize significant value and to share in the combined company upside. Trinidad’s excellent assets, strong customer relationships and highly-skilled personnel align well with Precision’s High Performance, High Value operations. Trinidad investors are not receiving appropriate value by selling to Ensign and exiting their investment now as they will be surrendering their unappreciated value to Ensign at a historically low price,” concluded Mr. Neveu.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Precision comments on misinformation press released by Ensign on November 16, 2018:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ensign’s assertion: “Full and Fair Value for Trinidad Shareholders.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">* Precision believes over time the value realized by Trinidad shareholders by owning 29% of the combined company will be greater than the cash value of $1.68 available now.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">* The inadequate Ensign Offer solidifies Trinidad's value at a low point in the industry and takes all the benefit of efficiency gains and future industry improvement for Ensign shareholders, at the expense of Trinidad shareholders. Ensign’s assertion: “Precision’s depressed share price means that Trinidad Shareholders will not receive full value for their Common Shares.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">* The Precision Share price has fluctuated materially through 2018 and significant upside remains. Based on the exchange ratio of 0.445 of a Precision Share for each Trinidad Share, the value to Trinidad shareholders at Precision’s 2018 high was $2.37 per share, 41% higher than the Ensign offer. This demonstrates the upside potential beyond the current implied exchange price. Ensign’s assertion: “Trinidad Shareholders will be exposed to the risks of increased financial leverage.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">* Precision’s credit ratings are generally stronger than Trinidad’s credit ratings and each credit agency following Precision viewed the proposed combination with Trinidad positively.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">* The Precision Transaction is modestly deleveraging for Precision with year-end 2019 Net Debt/Adjusted EBITDA estimated to be below 3.0x, based on Precision-provided guidance supported by industry research analysts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">* Precision’s credit facility is undrawn with approximately $867 million of liquidity in the combined company as at September 30, 2018.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">* Precision’s first note maturity is due in December 2021, over three years from today.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">* As demonstrated through previously provided guidance, Precision is expected to generate strong free cash flow and to continue to reduce the combined company’s debt levels. Ensign’s assertion: “The Inferior Precision Offer is not in the best interest of Trinidad Shareholders.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">* The Trinidad Board has determined the Precision Transaction is in the best interest of Trinidad shareholders.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">* The Precision Transaction provides Trinidad shareholders with the opportunity to be part of a combined company with significant upside potential and immediately improved public markets scale and liquidity. Ensign’s assertion: “The Inferior Precision Offer benefits current Precision shareholders at the expense of Trinidad Shareholders.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">* The Precision Transaction allows Trinidad and Precision shareholders to share in the synergies of the combined company, whereas the inadequate Ensign Offer allows only Ensign shareholders to realize the value of the synergies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">* The Precision Transaction was negotiated by both companies and has the unanimous support of the Trinidad Board. Precision comments on misinformation press released by Ensign on November 22, 2018:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ensign’s assertion: “Realization by Precision of synergies from their proposed acquisition of Trinidad is equally uncertain.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">* Precision has completed a detailed review of the combined companies’ potential fixed cost synergies and operational scale-based efficiencies and is confident that its estimate of $52 million in annualized synergies is attainable.

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Earlier this week, the B.C. government announced that all new cars and trucks sold in the province in the year 2040 and beyond will be required by law to have zero emissions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The government plans to introduce legislation in the spring to phase in targets for the sale of electric cars and hydrogen fuel cell vehicles. It will also be taking steps to make these cars cheaper for the buying public.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As announcements go, it didn’t get much traction because, in part, news of this sort isn’t news anymore. B.C.’s goal is actually relatively modest compared with what other countries and cities around the world are doing. Paris, Madrid, Athens and Mexico City are targeting 2025 as the year they will begin phasing out conventional, combustible engine automobiles. In fact, a growing number of countries in the <span class="companylink">European Union</span> are bringing in strict emissions legislation as they focus on introducing measures that will help them meet targets set under the Paris climate accord.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A peer-reviewed study[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41558-018-0182-1.epdf] published this summer in the journal Nature Climate Change predicts that advances in cheaper, clean technology will begin killing fossil-fuel demand in the next 15 to 20 years – or sooner. It suggests that oil-exporting countries, including Canada, will see a steep decline in their output and consequently will experience massive layoffs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Reducing fossil-fuel demand generates an overall positive effect for the <span class="companylink">EU</span> and China and a negative one for Canada and the United States,” the report says. The <span class="companylink">EU</span> and China aren’t expected to bear the brunt of this global shift because, one, they aren’t big energy exporters; and two, they have already begun transitioning to a lower-carbon future. Canada, and the oil sands in particular, are especially vulnerable because production costs are relatively expensive compared to other energy-exporting jurisdictions such as Saudi Arabia. That means those countries with the highest production costs are likely to be the first affected when demand begins slowing, as it will.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I mention this against the backdrop of what is happening currently in this country, and in particular, in Alberta. There is an economic crisis underway as a result of historically low oil prices in the province. And there doesn’t appear to be a lot of hope, on either the short or long-term horizon.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">All anyone is talking about is the need for more pipelines, as if that alone will solve the province’s problems. Sure, another pipeline will alleviate some of the economic misery Alberta is experiencing. But that is not going to happen for a while, if at all. Meantime, no one is talking about what is happening around the world, and the implications these changes have for the province.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Trans-Mountain pipeline expansion or not, demand for oil is going to decrease, and dramatically, in the not too distant future. And no one in Alberta, certainly among its political leadership, wants to even broach the subject.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What’s Plan B when oil prices collapse permanently? Well, there is no Plan B. The government, meantime, is facing a grave economic threat. The province’s financial picture is an ugly mess. University of Calgary economist Trevor Tombe recently released his own study on the province’s problems and it is a sobering read.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It suggests that current government policies are paving the way for deficits of $40-billion by 2040. Yes, you read that correctly. That’s for one year, if the Alberta government keeps spending the way it is. And that’s with oil prices recovering from the historic lows we are witnessing today. Mr. Tombe is predicting overall debt levels that have never been seen before, even during the Great Depression. In other words, the province’s finances are not sustainable.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, no political leader wants to talk about what happens when the demand for the province’s oil dries up. No political leader wants to talk about the need for a sales tax to increase revenues or the massive public-sector cuts that will be required to balance the books in the absence of one. All the political and business leadership class in the province want to talk about is pipelines.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One pipeline is not going to fix all that ails Alberta. And someone needs to have the courage to begin a grown-up conversation about the new reality taking place outside the province, one that is changing its future by the day.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Premier Rachel Notley is calling on Ottawa[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/business/article-trudeau-gives-speech-in-calgary-amid-slumping-price-for-alberta-oil/] to help move more of the province’s crude by rail, a measure Prime Minister Justin Trudeau stopped short of endorsing during a visit to Alberta (for subscribers). Trudeau told a crowd at the Calgary Chamber of Commerce that the depressed crude prices, sparked by a backlog due to a lack of space on pipelines, are “unacceptable” and that the energy sector is facing a “crisis.” He said his top priority is building the Trans Mountain project to get more oil to market. Notley, however, said that’s not enough and vowed to buy rail cars alone to boost shipments if Ottawa doesn’t help.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Gary Mason writes that[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/opinion/article-whats-the-economic-plan-b-for-alberta-there-isnt-one/] there’s no economic Plan B for Alberta: “no political leader wants to talk about what happens when the demand for the province’s oil dries up.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The private Toronto all-boys institution said principal Greg Reeves and president Jefferson Thompson resigned because[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/canada/toronto/article-st-michaels-college-president-principal-resign-amid-student-sex/] of a “shared desire to move the school forward without distractions.” Their exits come just over a week after news broke of an alleged sexual assault by a group of students against one of their classmates. Police are now investigating a total of six incidents: two alleged sexual assaults, three alleged assaults, and one threatening incident.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Reeves had been criticized for not immediately notifying police after he was made aware of a video depicting the first reported sexual assault. Just a day before the resignations, the board chair said the two men “continue to have our trust.” Upon their departure, the school applauded their “courageous decision” as an example of putting students “first.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Kremlin critics are urging Canada to seek Russia’s suspension from <span class="companylink">Interpol</span>
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Critics say[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/politics/article-kremlin-critics-urge-canada-to-seek-russias-suspension-from-interpol/] Russia uses the global police force to arrest and harass political enemies as a way to settle scores. Prominent anti-Kremlin voice Bill Browder was on hand as Canada became the first country to hold hearings into the troubles facing <span class="companylink">Interpol</span>. Browder, who has led an international campaign to adopt sanctions against Russia’s human-rights abusers, said Moscow has made seven separate attempts to use <span class="companylink">Interpol</span> to arrest him on trumped-up charges. He said he’s lucky that the force has rejected those requests, but that other critics without the same international profile have been arrested. The RCMP’s Chief Superintendent Scott Doran played down the threat from Russia, saying <span class="companylink">Interpol</span> has sufficient checks and balances in place.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, the head of the Kremlin’s military intelligence agency has died[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/world/article-head-of-russian-spy-agency-accused-of-british-poison-attack-dies/] at the age of 62 after what Russia called “a serious and long illness.” Colonel-General Igor Korobov had been accused of orchestrating poison attacks against Kremlin critics.

Lenz and James were escorted out of the legislature by police on Tuesday and placed on administrative leave pending a criminal investigation into unspecified wrongdoing connected to their official duties. The complaint to police had been made by the Speaker.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Why we should start treating floods and fires like migration crises</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Major natural disasters, especially the kind that have been experienced this century, don’t just drive people out of their homes for a few days, or even months. A large proportion are displaced for very long periods – and many never return. Sometimes, as researchers found was the case with New Orleans after Katrina, the ones who never return are the lucky ones. Disasters rupture communities in ways that aren’t easily remedied. Unfortunately, we still tend to think of these events as anomalies. We might be able to mobilize society to cope with the long-term human displacement of a single once-in-a-century catastrophe. But what if rising atmospheric temperatures and ocean levels mean that once-in-a-century catastrophes are occurring every few months?” – Doug Saunders[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/opinion/article-why-we-should-start-treating-floods-and-fires-like-migration-crises/]

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">PSA: Black Friday is terrible</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Where Boxing Day always felt like an adventure in spending gift cards and Christmas money with friends after days of family-only extravaganzas (and still does, let me have this), Black Friday became the capitalist Hunger Games. By courting long lines to amplify the demand for extremely limited deals, stores pit customers against each other. And then, to highlight the frenzy the day ends up breeding (see footage of people running into Walmarts or Best Buys), those same customers are often videotaped and laughed at, as though trying to buy something at an affordable price is a punchline. As if the working class responding to the one day they’ve been given to buy what they’ve been told their worth hinges on is hilarious. As if the pressure we put on everyone to create the perfect holiday via rabid consumerism isn’t the result of a system that sets up the majority to fail.” – Anne T. Donahue,[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/opinion/article-psa-black-friday-is-terrible/] author of Nobody Cares</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Green Book’s place within the canon of white-saviour cinema</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“After I took in the predominantly white audience’s reaction to the “feel-good” movie about a virtuosic black pianist (Mahershala Ali) touring the Deep South during the height of Jim Crow-era America with his white driver and pseudo-bodyguard (Viggo Mortensen), it seemed obvious that the film would win the Toronto International Film Festival’s coveted People’s Choice Award (which it did). … The irony, of course, being that a feel-good film about race relations during one of America’s darkest periods is an inherently antithetical concept. Director Peter Farrelly’s source material was based on the very real friendship between Dr. Don Shirley and Tony (Tony Lip) Vallelonga, but that doesn’t save his film from falling into the canon of preachy white-saviour movies that crop up every so often in American cinema. These films win audience awards and dominate the box office because they offer relief, and ease – appealing directly to white audiences who want to feel socially conscious without being challenged.” –  Kelsey Adams [https://www.theglobeandmail.com/arts/film/article-green-books-place-within-the-canon-of-white-saviour-cinema/] (for subscribers)</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MOMENT IN TIME</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Doctor Who debuts on <span class="companylink">BBC</span>
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nov. 23, 1963: The day after JFK’s assassination, the world’s attention lay far away from the debut of a new sci-fi series on the <span class="companylink">BBC</span>. Doctor Who, by and large the brainchild of Sydney Newman, a Canadian who was the broadcaster’s head of drama, originally had an educational mandate. The main characters would travel through space and time visiting important moments in history. The first story showcased this concept succinctly. The main character, an alien played by William Hartnell, was accompanied by his teenage granddaughter and two of her teachers as they visited a tribe of cavemen to watch the discovery of fire. Unfortunately for Newman’s educational goal, the very next story introduced a race of evil semi-robots called the Daleks, and children were too thrilled, scared and entertained to realize they were supposed to be learning about Nazis and radiation. Viewing figures shot up, the show became a sensation across Britain, and the educational remit fell away. Today, 55 years later, Doctor Who is a global phenomenon with a cult following. Its longevity has required multiple changes or “regenerations” of the title character, and the current season is on its 13th actor (and first woman) to play the Doctor. – Ken Carriere</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Their response: He still has work to do.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Finance Minister Bill Morneau unveiled a fiscal update Wednesday in Ottawa with $14 billion in temporary writeoffs for capital investment, a pledge to slash red tape, some direct cash for businesses and a push to boost export markets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It was all meant as a bold response to warnings about Canada's fading competitiveness, particularly after U.S. President Donald Trump cut U.S. corporate taxes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The mini-budget won acclaim from business groups - they're "pleased," "encouraged" and "pleasantly surprised."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But they're also not satisfied.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Calls persist for the Liberal government to do more on tax reform, on streamlining regulations and on reining in the deficit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That's not to mention doing something about an oil-price crisis in Alberta, where the fiscal update landed with a thud ahead of a visit Thursday by the prime minister.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The crisis happening in this province affects the whole country but they are speaking a different language," said Alberta Finance Minister Joe Ceci, whose government is losing millions in royalties because of a near-record discount for local heavy crude compared to benchmark U.S. oil prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We must get our product to tidewater and nothing today addresses that."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Generally, business reaction will be "at least moderately positive," Perrin Beatty, president of the Canadian Chamber of Commerce, said in an interview on Wednesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"They didn't go all the way in terms of accelerated writeoffs for capital investment, but they went much of the way." He nonetheless called for more to be done. The tax breaks for investment were the centrepiece of a document that otherwise showed both rising revenues and deficits.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Investments in some sectors, such as manufacturing, can now be written off entirely, while all sectors saw at least some increase.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On average, the measures will reduce the marginal tax rate on new investment to 13.8 per cent, from 17 per cent currently, keeping an advantage over a U.S. rate of 18.7 per cent, according to government calculations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Morneau called the tax breaks good for everyone, including Alberta's oil industry.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We've helped all Canadian businesses - in all sectors, in all geographies, including the oil and gas sector - with significant acceleration of depreciation expenses," he said in an interview with <span class="companylink">Bloomberg Television</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That's "creating an opportunity for investing in an advantaged way that we think is going to improve investment, again, in all sectors."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The fiscal update showed government revenues exceeded expectations, but new spending and the tax breaks ate that up entirely.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The deficit rose and will total $83.5 billion over five years, up from the $78.3 billion projected over the same time frame in February's budget.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The deficit for the 2018-19 fiscal is actually projected to be below what was forecast, at $18.1 billion. However, each of the four following years are now seen having bigger shortfalls.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Canada's total debt is projected to rise to $765 billion by 2023-24, from $688 billion in 2018-19, while the ratio of debt to gross domestic product is forecast to fall.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The business investment measures, along with tentative agreement on a new continental trade deal with the U.S. and Mexico, "could combine to meaningfully spark investment," Bank of Montreal chief economist Doug Porter said in a research note.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Today's announcement is a good first step in strengthening the business climate in Canada.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"But we would encourage an even more forceful response in coming months to the multitude of competitive challenges now facing the economy," Porter said.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Credit rating agency's outlook for 2019 says province is heading in the right direction</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Manitoba economy is on track to wipe out its budget deficit ahead of schedule, credit rating agency <span class="companylink">DBRS Ltd</span>. says.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The province has outperformed its budgetary targets “so significantly" the past couple years and DBRS believes that bodes well for balancing its budget ahead of the target date of 2024.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“So maybe they balance the budget sooner than that eight-year mark. I think that's the growing expectation," Paul LeBane, DBRA vice-president of public finance, said in a telephone interview.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A cautionary note is Manitoba's deficit reduction is being carried out at a fairly gradual pace. That leaves it vulnerable to upset from a recession or natural disaster like a flood.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“There's always a risk something throws that whole plan off course," LeBane said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The government in Saskatchewan has doled out much stronger medicine and plans to balance its budget by 2019-20.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Saskatchewan found itself in a large deficit position when potash and oil prices went into a tailspin. The Saskatchewan government has made major cuts in spending and the government workforce and the deficit is now falling very quickly.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">DBRS released its Canadian Provincial Government Outlook for 2019 this week.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Most Canadian provinces including Manitoba are getting their financial ships in order, or are at least steering in the right direction, the report says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Exceptions are Alberta and New Brunswick.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Alberta continues to incur large operating deficits. In the absence of more meaningful deficit reduction measures, the credit profile will continue to slowly erode," the report says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New Brunswick is also on a negative track and could see its credit rating drop from A (high) to just an A in 2019.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The DBRS report says all provinces benefited from strong economic growth over the past two years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That growth is expected to start slowing down to a “more sustainable pace" due to interest rate pressure, and cyclical and structural factors that weigh on growth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">LeBane said Manitoba's previous government was running a “structural" deficit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Governments may run a deficit during an economic downturn that corrects itself when the economy rebounds. However, a structural deficit keeps growing whether the economy is doing well or poorly because the budget fundamentals are out of whack, LeBane said. Essentially, the government is spending more money than it brings in.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“What we see in Manitoba is positive. There's recognition that there was a problem and it's being addressed," LeBane said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“It's not just deficit reduction but the government's effort to improve program outcomes, and to stop doing things from before that they maybe didn't need to do."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Manitoba's deficit fell to $726 million in 2017-18 from $765 million the previous year. The deficit is money added to the province's annual debt. Manitoba has projected a deficit of $521 million for 2018-19, with annual improvements of $105 million to $140 million thereafter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The DBRS report says the Pallister's government's “commitment to further improvement appears credible."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Manitoba has seen steady growth in recent years from increases in population, and a relatively young population compared to the rest of the country. It has also seen growth in investment in certain sectors, the report says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Its economy is more diverse and therefore less volatile, not seeing the same strong growth as other economies but not falling as hard in economic downturns either.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">However, the report notes Manitoba has relatively high taxes and few options to significantly increase revenue, which leaves the province with limited budgetary flexibility.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rising interest rates and global trade tensions remain risks to the global economic outlook, but the resolution of <span class="companylink">NAFTA</span> negotiations has eased near-term risk.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The report notes stark differences in how two NDP-run provinces operate in Western Canada.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In British Columbia, the government is producing “thin" budget surpluses and has come in under budget targets. If that continues, it could even see its credit rating improve, the DBRS report says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">However, the NDP government in Alberta “has yet to demonstrate meaningful action to address its fiscal imbalances and the province continues to erode its low-debt advantage."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The economy in Alberta has stabilized since the oil price correction, but long-term growth may be hindered by pipeline constraints and projected weak oil prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Quebec's credit profile has steadily improved over the past decade thanks to budget surpluses due to a strengthened economy and government commitment to rein in spending.</p>

Bill Morneau is a Micawber-like figure, unshakable in his optimism that the worst won't happen.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Neither snow nor rain nor recession nor the gloom of adverse court decisions on key pipeline infrastructure can stay the finance minister's sunny view of the Canadian economy.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Not even the prospect of the engine of the country's economic growth - the Alberta oilpatch - seizing up.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There is a widely held view in Alberta that the Liberal government is trying to sink the oil industry and that the purchase of the Trans Mountain pipeline was a smoke-screen.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"That is an absurd proposition," Morneau said in an interview in his spacious office overlooking downtown Ottawa, the day after he delivered his fall economic update.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He said the $4.5 billion investment in Trans Mountain was "indicative of our absolute desire to make sure we resolve a very important challenge".</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The government has been accused of adding to Alberta's price differential woes by introducing C69, the environmental impact assessment bill that is currently before the Senate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Morneau said that he is working with industry to make sure it meets their joint goal of getting projects built.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"My sense is that we will be able to do that in a way that will provide confidence to the sector. I don't accept the argument that this government has not been very, very focused on how we can deal with the challenge of getting our resources to international markets."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We're the government that substituted action for words," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Action on any number of fronts has proven expensive and Morneau stands accused of being cavalier with the public finances.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He is defensive when questioned about his claim that the latest fall update was "fiscally responsible." After all, the document projects the national debt will reach $767 billion in 2023-24 - a number 20-per-cent higher than the $617 billion owed in Stephen Harper's last year in office.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Morneau said the $14-billion plan to allow businesses to write off investments in machinery and other assets more quickly was an appropriate response to changes to the tax structure in the United States.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Most analysts would concede this is at least productive spending - companies have to invest to get it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The real problem is that the economy has been performing strongly - revenues were up nearly 10 per cent in the first six months of the fiscal year - yet the deficit still increased because of this government's inveterate spending problem.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Conservative analyst Sean Speer and Morneau's former policy adviser, Robert Asselin, wrote recently that "policy-makers will have almost no leverage when the next recession hits."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Morneau said he accepts that the country always needs to be prepared for the eventuality of a downturn.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I will also make the assertion that we don't want to be the ones to trigger a lower level of growth so that we precipitate those concerns," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We are the country among our key allies that has the lowest debt as a function of our economy. That's the most important measure of our resilience to deal with unexpected economic challenges. We've made a commitment that we're going to reduce the debt as a function of our economy on a goingforward basis. You can see in our fall economic statement, we expect revenues to be greater than expenses, which continues to put us in a positive situation."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Morneau said the move to budgetary balance is just "a question of timing."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is true that budgetary revenues do outpace program expenses going forward.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But that does not include the public debt charges that will contribute to deficits of $95 billion in the next five years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">All of these assumptions are based on private sector growth projections of nearly two per cent a year going forward.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If that happy scenario does not play out, a government already in the red will be faced with the double whammy of declining tax revenues and higher employment insurance and social assistance payments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In that event, the continuous reduction of debt as a proportion of GDP that Morneau clings to will not happen.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The finance minister maintains his government has "found the appropriate balance" in a "changed competitive reality" between fiscal prudence and spending.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I asked if the government made a mistake with its initial burst of social spending on seniors and child benefit. When the government took office, income levels were on the rise across the country - the median national income rose by more than 10 per cent between 2005 and 2015; the number of seniors in poverty was half the general population and falling; the share of child poverty was declining and so on.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Did the government need to support sections of society who were getting better off anyway - particularly when it required borrowed money? "We had a clear objective in 2015 to deal with the fact that the benefits of growth in the decade before were going disproportionately to some sectors of the population. We know that led to a sense of discontent and anxiety among middle-class Canadians. Our goal was to make sure that everybody gained."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But everybody was already gaining? "Everybody was gaining but the gains were going disproportionately to smaller sub-sets of the population. Our goal - and it's a goal that has been satisfied - was that by making sure that we put in place policies that enabled everyone to be success. Three years later, we've had significantly increased workforce participation among women, among new immigrants, among youth, among Indigenous Canadians. Our goal is to have all Canadians be successful to address the demographic challenge. That's been achieved over the last three years," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Morneau will not be shaken from his view that all will be well.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I suggest that Canada is now locked into a series of structural deficits that will not disappear with economic growth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We don't see it like that," he said. "Look at economists'expectations for growth and what happens to our fiscal situation. We get into a very good situation in a very reasonable time-frame."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And we do if you take the optimistic view and share the interpretation of the four most positive economists, who project budgetary balance within five years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But as an optimist who always carries an umbrella, I'd be more comfortable with a finance minister who worked on the most gloomy prognostication on offer - the four economists who think the deficit will be $5-billion-a-year worse than current forecasts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As even Mr. Micawber knew: "Annual income twenty pounds, annual expenditure twenty pounds ought and six, result misery."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There is no question that folks in Alberta, folks here in Calgary, are living through extremely difficult times. This is very much a crisis," Trudeau said Thursday following an affordable housing announcement.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"When you have a price differential that's up around $42, $50 even, that's a massive challenge to local industry, to the livelihood of a lot of Albertans. I hear that very, very clearly."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Premier Rachel Notley has said the price gap between Canadian and U.S. crude is costing the Canadian economy $80 million a day.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hundreds of pro-oil protesters shut down part of the street outside the hotel where Trudeau addressed the Calgary Chamber of Commerce.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Inside, chamber CEO Sandip Lalli grilled Trudeau on what Ottawa intends to do, including possibly investing in moving crude on trains as a stop-gap measure as new market-opening pipelines remain in limbo.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Currently, the federal government doesn't have a plan to address the $80 million that's coming out?" Lalli asked Trudeau in a questionand-answer session.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"You think there's a supersimple easy answer and there's not. There's a multifaceted complex issue and as much as there is a tendency out there in the world to give really simple answers to really complex questions, unfortunately the world doesn't work like that," Trudeau replied.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We need to make sure that we're moving forward in the right way and that is where actually listening to the experts is sort of the best way to make policy."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Trudeau said the federal government is doing what it can to get the Trans Mountain pipeline expansion built, which would triple its capacity to carry oil to tankers on the West Coast.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The federal government bought Trans Mountain and its expansion project for $4.5 billion last summer only to have the Federal Court of Appeal strike down its approval, citing inadequate Indigenous consultation and failure to consider impacts on marine wildlife.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Trudeau said the sector should benefit from his government's announcement Wednesday that companies will be able to immediately write off capital investments. However, the federal fiscal update included no Albertaspecific measures - prompting a harsh reaction from the province.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The crisis happening in this province affects the whole country but they are speaking a different language," Alberta Finance Minister Joe Ceci said Wednesday. "We must get our product to tidewater and nothing today addresses that."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Canadian Natural Resources executive vice-chairman Steve Laut, who participated in a roundtable with the prime minister Thursday, said the accelerated capital cost allowance "doesn't matter with differentials where they are because nobody's going to spend any money."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Laut said Trudeau seemed to appreciate how dire the situation is and was receptive to ideas. But he said he's skeptical a federal investment in crude-by-rail, as the Alberta government has urged, would deliver swift relief.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I don't know what more the federal government can do that companies ourselves can't do," Laut said. "Getting (rail) cars is tough to do. It takes time to build these things."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Notley said last month the federal government needs to step up to support a rail expansion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But federal officials, speaking to Bloomberg News, said Ottawa is unlikely to heed the plea because it would take at least a year to get the new trains in place, On Thursday, Notley said the province is willing to go it alone to buy trains to add between 120,000 and 140,000 barrels per day of oil export capacity.</p>

In recent weeks, the share price has been rallying while the S&P/TSX Composite Index has been faltering. The share price has increased 38 per cent in the past two weeks.

</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A brief outline is provided below that may serve as a springboard for further fundamental research.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The company</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Alberta-based Tervita is an environmental services provider.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On July 19, <span class="companylink">Tervita Corp</span>. merged with <span class="companylink">Newalta Corp</span>. to form a leading energy-focused waste and industrial services company. Tervita has two core business segments: Energy Services and Industrial Services. The Energy Services division accounts for the majority of the company’s earnings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After the market closed on Nov. 14, the company reported better-than-expected third quarter financial results that sent the share price soaring 8 per cent the next trading day.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the earnings release, president and chief executive officer John Cooper reflected on the company’s solid quarter, Tervita’s first quarter as a combined company, remarking, “Our combined operations delivered strong performance with adjusted EBITDA [earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization] increasing 69 per cent year-over-year to $71-million, with an adjusted EBITDA margin of 35 per cent. These results reflect our recent merger with Newalta and contributions from our growth and expansion investments in key regions. The integration is progressing well and synergies are on track with the combination of the two companies delivering exactly the kind of incremental benefits we had envisioned. We expect annualized run rate synergies of $20 to $22 million by the end of 2018, and to deliver $40 to $45 million of annualized synergies by August 2020.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He also said the headwinds faced by companies operating in the energy sector, stating, “Although the overall industry outlook is somewhat tempered due to current challenges facing the Canadian oil and gas sector, our expanded network is well positioned to provide our customers with opportunities to obtain the best available price for their products. We expect to finish the year with continued positive momentum. With a strong balance sheet underpinned by more stable production-related revenue, we remain well positioned to deliver double-digit growth and to capitalize on emerging market catalysts as they arise.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The CEO provided additional insights on the earnings call with respect to the industry challenges, “Our Energy Services revenues are significantly underpinned by ongoing production, and production out of the Western Canadian Sedimentary Basin is expected to increase 300,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in 2018 and a further 200,000 barrels of oil equivalent in 2019. We expect this to provide stability to our performance, and it's the main reason for the strong volume and the results we continue to see from our Heavy Oil facilities. The widening differentials tied to the lack of pipeline takeaway capacity is expected to persist into 2019. While we remain disappointed with the lack of progress on building these pipeline, this supports our ability to attract and optimize crude oil volumes through our network of facilities and continue to assist our customers to maximize the price they receive for the products in a very difficult environment. Industry expectations are for drilling in 2019 to remain relatively flat with the year-to-date 2018 activity.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dividend policy</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Management is focused on growth and currently does not pay its shareholders a dividend.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Analysts’ recommendations</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The average one-year target price is $12.98, implying the stock price may have 33 per cent upside potential over the next 12 months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Insider transaction activities</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Quarter-to-date, there has not been any trading activity reported by insiders. The most recent trades reported by insiders occurred in Sept.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Sept. 5, chair Grant Billing purchased 4,400 shares at a price per share of $9.13. The prior day, he acquired 4,900 shares at a cost per share of $9.12. These two transactions increased his portfolio’s holdings to 30,000 shares.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The share price of this energy services stock has rallied 38 per cent over the past two weeks, sharply outperforming the market, which has been in a downtrend.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The stock has a brief trading history, making technical analysis of limited value. That being said, the share price is approaching a major ceiling of resistance around $10.50, near its record closing high of $10.44 reached on July 25. There is initial downside support around $9. Failing that, there is technical support around $8.50, which is close to its 50-day moving average (at $8.33).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This small-cap stock can be thinly traded. The three-month historical daily average trading volume is approximately 208,000 shares.</p>

In addition, this report highlights a company’s dividend policy, analysts’ recommendations, financial forecasts, and provides a brief technical analysis for a security to provide readers with more information.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If a stock appears on the positive breakouts list, this indicates positive price momentum, and that a company may be worthwhile for investors to look at the fundamentals in order to determine if the recent price strength is warranted and will continue. If a security appears on the negative breakouts list, this indicates negative price momentum, and may be indicative of either deteriorating fundamentals or perhaps indicates a buying opportunity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Securities screened are from the S&P/TSX composite index, the S&P/TSX Small Cap index, as well as Canadian small cap stocks outside of these indices that have a minimum market capitalization of $200-million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A technical analysis screen does not replace fundamental analysis, but can help identify companies worth having a closer look at.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He grew up at a time when life for aboriginal peoples was circumscribed not only by vicious discrimination but by law, Sean Fine writes[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/canada/article-harry-laforme-a-pioneering-indigenous-judge-looks-back-in-anger-at/] . His father needed government permission to leave their reserve. The federal Indian agent ran band council meetings. If you wanted to put an issue on the agenda, it had to be in English. He grew up angry, ashamed of his Indigenous heritage, hanging around pool halls, not caring what he did with his life.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet he became Canada’s first and only Indigenous judge on an appellate court.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Justice Harry LaForme, who retired from the Ontario Court of Appeal last month, has long since overcome the rage of his youth, but he is angry once more. He has come a long way, but he believes that Canada, in some important respects, has not. He is angry on behalf of his community, but it’s personal, too.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He might have been a candidate for the <span class="companylink">Supreme Court of Canada</span>, he says. Former prime minister Kim Campbell, who chaired a committee putting together a short list for Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, wrote him a letter inviting him to apply.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Kostin’s market outlook for 2019 is called “The Return of Risk” and on page one he writes,</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We forecast the S&P 500 will generate a modest single-digit absolute return in 2019. The risk-adjusted return will be less than half the long-term average. Cash will represent a competitive asset class to stocks for the first time in many years.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The implication is that investors will need a strong stomach to weather market volatility for a meagre reward. Mr. Kostin is focused on U.S. equities but things aren’t likely to be any smoother for the S&P/TSX Composite Index. Merrill Lynch’s projections[https://twitter.com/SBarlow_ROB/status/1065240277223387136] for a ‘pervasive and persistent global [economic] downturn’ would be very bad news for the almost half of the benchmark connected to mining and energy companies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I believe it’s time for investors to get more defensive, and focus on how painful a large loss could be to their future wealth rather than the possible regret of missing part of a market rally.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The suggestion to increase cash allocations – to an extent dependent on individual investment time horizons and risk tolerances, of course – is less of a market timing call then it appears. In one sense, it would be chasing performance – a 2.5- per-cent, one-year GIC has outperformed the S&P/TSX Composite by almost 700 basis points so far this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A defensive, cash-heavier approach would also suit Canada’s aging population. As retirement approaches, investors have less time to make up for any temporary losses in the market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I’ve been writing[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/investing/markets/inside-the-market/article-research-firms-foresee-a-gloomy-2019/] all[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/investing/markets/inside-the-market/article-buy-the-dip-strategy-stops-working-after-16-years-investors-dont/] week[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/investing/investment-ideas/article-big-wall-street-banks-predict-market-misery-for-2019-tsx-stocks-to/] about the relentless pessimism in the 2019 market and economic forecasts published so far, but the consensus view has been wrong before. In the 2013-2016 period, for instance, economists repeatedly assured investors that interest rates were set to rise, only to see them keep falling every year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Kostin’s prediction that returns on cash and similar investments will be competitive with equity market returns in 2019 could turn out wrong, but smaller returns and being able to sleep at night during volatile markets is not a terrible place to be.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Three reasons to stay optimistic about markets – and one reason not to be</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Market is depressed. This does not mean Mr. Market is correct. The recent tumble in world stock markets reflects escalating gloom about the global economy, just as record highs for the S&P 500 in mid-September demonstrated boundless enthusiasm about the outlook for the U.S. economy. There is a strong possibility that both will turn out to be emotional overreactions. For all the reasons to worry about what lies ahead, there are corresponding arguments for optimism. In recent weeks, investors have fixated on one side of the argument – and for good reason, given the Brexit shambles and mounting U.S.-China tensions – but they should keep the other side of the debate in mind. Reasonable valuations, robust consumers (outside Canada, anyway) and supportive central banks suggest this is no time for panic[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/investing/markets/inside-the-market/article-enough-doom-and-gloom-there-is-plenty-of-reason-to-be-optimistic/] .

Should we be more conservative and raise cash?’ ” says Ms. Poole, chief executive officer and managing director at Toronto-based GlobeInvest Capital Management Inc.

What you should be doing in reaction to every stock market downturn[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/investing/investment-ideas/article-what-you-should-be-doing-in-reaction-to-every-stock-market-downturn/]

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ask Globe Investor</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Question: In anticipation of higher interest rates in Canada and the United States, is John Heinzl contemplating making any changes to the holdings in his model portfolio[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/investing/investment-ideas/article-john-heinzls-model-dividend-growth-portfolio-as-of-oct-31-2018/] , particularly those holdings that are interest-rate sensitive?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Answer: Well, as I’m sure you realize, interest rates have already gone up. The five-year <span class="companylink">Government of Canada</span> bond, for instance, now yields about 2.3 per cent – roughly double its yield at the start of 2017. So, the time to sell my interest-rate sensitive stocks has probably passed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Not that I would have sold, anyway. My strategy is based on buying and holding great companies that raise their dividends regularly, and that includes utilities, power producers, real estate investment trusts and other stocks that are sensitive to rising rates. I would much rather collect an uninterrupted stream of dividends than try to time my sales and purchases based on predictions (which may be wrong) about where rates are heading.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even if I timed my sales at precisely the moment when interest-sensitive stocks started falling (easier said than done), how would I know when to buy back in? Not only is trading fraught with risks, but it’s way more stressful than buying and holding.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Besides, research has shown that while sectors such as utilities tend to fall when rates initially rise, the shares eventually rebound. Indeed, utilities such as <span class="companylink">Fortis Inc</span>. ( FTS[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/investing/markets/stocks/FTS-T/] ) and <span class="companylink">Emera Inc</span>. ( EMA[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/investing/markets/stocks/EMA-T/] ) have posted double-digit gains over the past month, which suggests investors believed the stocks had been driven down to attractive levels. It could also indicate that, with the global economy slowing, rates might not rise as far, or as fast, as previously believed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">(Disclosure: I personally own FTS and EMA, which are also in my model Yield Hog Dividend Growth Portfolio[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/investing/investment-ideas/article-john-heinzls-model-dividend-growth-portfolio-as-of-oct-31-2018/] .)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So, no, I won’t be trading in and out of interest-sensitive stocks. The only time I consider selling is when the outlook for the company has changed for the worse, but that’s not the case with any of my utilities, power producers or REITs.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Chinese markets extended their slump in Asia amid the trade war with the United States, and Europe followed suit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The region had plenty of concerns of its own. Italy was under pressure in both stock and bond markets as sparring resumed over its budget plans. Some disappointing big-name earnings added to the gloom.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Britain’s FTSE was off 1 per cent, Germany’s DAX fell 0.6 per cent and France’s CAC declined 0.4 per cent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Europe’s tech sector lost another 1.2 percent, but it wasn’t the worst performer. Banks were 1.6 percent weaker and mining companies and other resources firms were down nearly 2 percent and approaching a one-month low.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That reflected the bitter Sino-U.S. trade war, encouraging investors to take money off the table before U.S. President Donald Trump and his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping, meet in Argentina next week.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The focus will be on whether they can make any progress on their trade feud. Singapore became the latest to warn about the potential impact on Thursday. The city state is considered as a bellwether for international trade.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Oil prices fell on Thursday after U.S. crude inventories swelled to their highest level since December stoking concerns about a global glut but <span class="companylink">OPEC</span> talk of an output reduction limited losses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Benchmark Brent fell 67 cents to US$62.82 a barrel, after dropping by as much as US$1 earlier in the session. U.S. WTI fell more than a US$1 before easing back to trade down 79 cents at US$53.84.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. commercial crude oil inventories climbed by 4.9 million barrels to 446.91 million barrels last week, the <span class="companylink">U.S. Energy Information Administration</span> (EIA) said on Wednesday, its highest level since December. U.S. crude oil production also stayed at a record 11.7 million barrels per day (bpd), the EIA said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tamas Varga, analyst at PVM brokerage, said the market trend was “still bearish.” “The question is what <span class="companylink">OPEC</span> will do in December, will they cut, and if so, by how much?” he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries</span> is worried about the emergence of a glut that could pull down prices further.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Gold prices crept higher on Thursday towards a two-week peak scaled in the previous session, helped by an easing dollar and as investors sought refuge from weakness in financial markets on economic growth concerns.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Spot gold was up 0.1 per cent at US$1,227.20 an ounce, though moves were contained by the U.S. Thanksgiving holiday. Prices on Wednesday had peaked at US$1,230.07, the highest level since Nov. 7. U.S. gold futures were flat at US$1,228.20.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The dollar fell for a second day running, while Europe’s share markets dropped into the red as investor worries mounted about slowing global growth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Weaker stocks tend to be supportive of the gold market, given the uncertainty that prevailing in the market,” said Saxo Bank analyst Ole Hansen, adding that the softer dollar was also adding support.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Gold could be vulnerable to more gains if the dollar weakens further, making bullion cheaper for holders of other currencies, analysts said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Currencies and bonds</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Canadian dollar was slightly higher at 75.57 US cents in early trading Thursday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The USD/CAD has retraced part of Tuesday’s outsized rally on the back of firmer crude oil prices (+1.9 per cent) and a bounce in U.S. equities (0.3 per cent). With today being a U.S. holiday combined with a lack of domestic data releases, liquidity will be more of a factor as USD/CAD takes direction from broader moves in risk. Support is located at $1.3202 and $1.3169, with $1.3270 and $1.3348 serving as resistance," said a note from <span class="companylink">RBC Capital Markets</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The U.S. dollar edged lower for a second consecutive day as greater risk appetite board encouraged investors to sell the greenback after a recent rally.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Indicators of risk in the currency markets such as the euro against the Swiss franc and the Canadian dollar flashed green, though gains were tiny, since U.S. markets were shut for Thanksgiving Day.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Markets are on a slightly stronger footing today though moves are unlikely to be large given the U.S. markets are closed,” said Ulrich Leuchtmann, an FX strategist at <span class="companylink">Commerzbank</span> in Frankfurt. Against a basket of other currencies, the dollar slipped 0.1 per cent at 96.65, retreating away from a near 1 1/2-year high of 97.693, hit earlier this month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Canadian 10-year bond yield was slightly higher at 2.366 per cent. The U.S. 10-year Treasury yield was at 3.065 per cent.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The focus is on whether they can make any progress on their trade feud.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Countries belonging to the G20 group of the world’s biggest economies applied 40 new trade restrictive measures between mid-May and mid-October, covering around $481 billion of trade, the <span class="companylink">World Trade Organization</span> said on Thursday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Three-quarters of the restrictions were tariff hikes, many of them retaliation to steel and aluminium tariffs imposed by U.S. President Donald Trump in March.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the <span class="companylink">WTO</span> did not count measures announced since or not yet implemented, and one G20 country had asked for its actions to be omitted from the monitoring report, the <span class="companylink">WTO</span> said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With no U.S. trading to look forward to later, traders contented themselves by watching Europe’s Brexit drama unfold.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sterling jumped back up to $1.29 and 88.50 pence per euro after London and Brussels agreed on a text setting out their post-split ties that <span class="companylink">EU</span> leaders are expected to endorse at a summit on Sunday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Just over four months before Britain’s departure from the <span class="companylink">EU</span>, Brexit negotiations and political uncertainty in Britain remain the key drivers for the pound, and many analysts are cautious about its prospects.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“With the UK and <span class="companylink">EU</span> rushing to dot i’s and cross t’s on a Brexit deal, there’s some support for sterling at the moment and some upward pressure on the front end of the rates market,” said <span class="companylink">Societe Generale</span> strategist Kit Juckes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Though it won’t take long before we refocus on the challenge facing the Prime Minister in getting House of Commons support for her Brexit deal,” he added.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Simon Fraser, the former permanent secretary at the UK foreign office, said he expected British politicians to vote on May’s deal on Dec. 10.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“There would be a huge amount of pressure put on members of parliament and I think there is a reasonable chance she would get this through ... if not at the first vote potentially in a second vote,” he told a call held by fund manager Amundi.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Brexit text had also seen the euro rise against the dollar which meant the single currency barely budged when <span class="companylink">ECB</span> meeting minutes showed its policymakers were keen to affirm their plans to cut stimulus at the end of the year.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">OTTAWA—Finance Minister Bill Morneau is defending his government's big tax breaks to corporate Canada, saying that Ottawa had to act or risk losing business investment to the U.S.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Confronting criticism that Wednesday's economic update was too focussed on business priorities, Morneau said that ensuring Canada remains competitive in the face of big corporate tax cuts south of the border is critical to the country's economy and job creation.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But he said that the Liberal government is mindful that it has more work to do to address the needs of low-income and middle-class Canadians.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We know there is always more to do in that regard, but we can't forget that, for a significant number of people, we've got to find the right jobs for the future,” Morneau told the Star.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The federal Liberals used this week's economic update[https://www.thestar.com/politics/federal/2018/11/21/ottawa-unveils-14b-in-tax-savings-for-businesses.html] to deliver tax changes to allow companies that invest in manufacturing and clean energy to write off their spending on new equipment right away. Other businesses will be able to write off more quickly a greater portion, but not the full amount, of their capital spending.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Those measures, which won praise from business groups, tally $14.4 billion. Other initiatives, such as regulatory reforms and a strategic innovation fund, to help companies find new markets, bring the total cost of business-focussed initiatives to $16.5 billion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Morneau says that Ottawa had to act in some way to ease the tax burden on Canadian corporations because of Washington's sharp cuts to corporate taxes, which had eliminated Canada's tax advantage.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The cost of not acting would be losing businesses that were already here and making Canada less attractive to foreign investors, he said, during an interview in his office in the Finance Department building.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We recognized that as our reality, so we wanted to make sure that that next investment can be made in Canada,” Morneau said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Not only are we assuring that investment, but we are assuring the newest technology will be here in Canada, which means the more exciting jobs,” he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Morneau, who is scheduled to a Toronto audience Friday about the update, said that based on “very positive feedback” from corporate leaders, he's confident that businesses will take advantage of the measures to make job-creating investments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We're making a decision for the long-term health of our economy and the exciting jobs of tomorrow. We need to do that at the same time as we think about how we assure that people who are really challenged are helped out along the way,” he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Morneau, who has served as Justin Trudeau's only finance minister, has one budget left before the next election in October, 2019.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Looking ahead, Morneau said that income equality, skills training to meet the changing economy and helping the less fortunate will be priorities for the final months in office.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Morneau said the measures taken so far by the government — notably the child benefit, the Canada Workers Benefit and increases to the guaranteed income supplement — will lift 652,000 people out of poverty.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“That's an enormous impact,” he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We don't think our job is done at all. We think we have to be continually focusing on how we ensure that middle class Canadians have optimism about the future and we need to continually be focusing on how people who are the most challenged in our society move into a better situation,” he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NDP MP Peter Julian (New Westminster-Burnaby) said the priorities laid out in the economic update were “completely inappropriate” and would do little to help the pocketbooks of everyday Canadians, many of whom are struggling with record levels of household debt.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The announcements … of massive corporate write-offs is unbelievable. It just shows how out of touch this government is, given the size and scope of what Canadians are struggling through,” said Julian, the party's finance critic.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He said the government should have moved on other initiatives, such as accelerating investments in affordable housing. “They are not doing the things that they need to do to support Canadians,” Julian said in an interview.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Parliament Hill Thursday, Conservative MPs Pierre Poilievre and Michelle Rempel criticized Liberal plans, laid out in the economic update, to help Canadian media outlets to the tune of $595 million over five years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The measures, which include a tax break for subscribers of digital news and tax credits to news organizations for a portion of their labour costs, are meant to assist media outlets left struggling by the downturn in ad revenues. The government said it will let an independent panel drawn from the journalism industry define eligibility for some of the measures.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Poilievre and Rempel condemned the move, saying the government shouldn't be underwriting media organizations. “A lot of the mainstream media outlets are not profitable. They're not thriving and is it the role of taxpayers to bail them out?” Rempel said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Morneau said that some details of the aid have to be confirmed in the budget, but he wanted to get the ball rolling on establishing the independent panel.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We see it as critically important that we have confidence in the independence,” he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In his update, Morneau laid out a rosy economic picture with unemployment at a 40-year low, rising wages and corporate profits and continued growth. That has helped boost government revenues, but the new spending means that a return to balanced books remains out of reach for the foreseeable future.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In fact, Ottawa is now projecting higher deficit spending — about $5 billion more over the next five years — than it did in its February budget.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Morneau says that even with the measures in the update, the debt-to-GDP ratio continues to decline and that Canada's debt position is more favourable than other G7 countries.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The one storm cloud is the sharp drop in oil prices which hurts not just Alberta, but Ottawa's bottom line, too. Morneau concedes there is no easy fix to depressed oil prices in Alberta, as there are roadblocks to getting oil to markets other than the U.S.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The federal government took the unusual step earlier this year of buying the Trans-Mountain pipeline in hopes of speeding construction of a second pipeline along the route, a project held up as further consultations take place.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“This is an enormous challenge. It's a long-term challenge,” Morneau said. “We don't have any magic solutions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We think the biggest single thing we can do is stay focused on what we're trying to achieve,” he said.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CALGARY—Prime Minister Justin Trudeau acknowledged a “crisis” in the Alberta economy during a Thursday visit to Calgary and attempted to assure business leaders that the federal government is taking the problem seriously.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a packed room of about 600 attendees at a conversation hosted by the Calgary Chamber, Trudeau said it “wasn't an accident” that this is his first stop after the federal government released its fall economic forecast Wednesday.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Despite a few who repeatedly tell me to stay away, I'm going to keep coming back,” he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The fact that my last name is Trudeau matters to some people, fine,” he said, underlining that he sees more issues that unite Canadians across the country.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But he said he knows the status quo “cannot continue” in Alberta as the price differential for the province's oil is “almost ridiculous.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“There is a huge level of anxiety, of worry, of frustration,” Trudeau said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Alberta oil is selling much lower than West Texas Intermediate in the United States due to a lack of pipeline capacity to move a growing glut of it to markets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The prime minister emphasized in his speech that his government is listening to input, and is working to get the Trans Mountain pipeline built so Alberta oil can be moved west and shipped overseas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Calgary Chamber director of communications Mark Cooper said it's encouraging that Trudeau is acknowledging fundamental problems choking Alberta's economy, but the Calgary business community is hungry for bigger solutions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Businesses are looking for action and urgency rather than platitudes, and we didn't see a lot of concrete action today,” he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“What we're hearing from the business community is the federal government needs to recognize that many of its policies and a lack of action are standing in the way of the city's recovery and standing in the way of business growth.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers CEO Tim McMillan echoed the need for urgency to get the province out of its current rut.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I know the Alberta government has asked for the federal government to step in on (shipping oil by) rail, which is a mid-term solution,” he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Longer term there are absolutely things the federal government needs to do to ensure we can compete in five years and we're not having the same conversation.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Trudeau held a roundtable discussion with 11 oil and energy business leaders after his speech.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A large crowd of protesters also greeted the prime minister outside the hotel where he spoke, with many holding pro-oil signs and chanting about the Trans Mountain pipeline. A heavy police presence shut down streets until about 3:30 p.m.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Trudeau's Thursday arrival comes a little more than a week after Calgarians decisively voted against pursuing a bid for the 2026 Olympics. Mayor Naheed Nenshi issued criticisms of the feds and province in the days after the plebiscite, saying they hadn't done enough to support the bid, leaving the city to “carry all the water.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The prime minister sat down for a meeting with Nenshi on Thursday afternoon. On Wednesday, the mayor said he wants to push for more commitments to how Ottawa will support the city in its ongoing economic recovery, especially in the wake of the Olympic bid's end.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The prime minister will wrap up his day in Calgary at an event at Canada Olympic Park on Thursday evening, along with federal sport minister Kirsty Duncan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Duncan was a major figure in Calgary's Olympic bid as Ottawa's funding commitment for the cost of hosting the 2026 Games was a question mark until just days before the plebiscite whether Calgarians were in favour of the bid.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A conversation about housing has to start with numbers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Whether you're a tenant struggling to find a home or a government crafting new policy during a nationwide housing crisis, you need to have a grip on good data.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The hunt for rental housing, particularly in Toronto and Vancouver, has become increasingly competitive and confusing as the number of people looking to live in cities continues to outpace what is actually being built.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Renters going to shop for a place to rent have almost no information,” said David Hulchanski, a housing and community development expert at the <span class="companylink">University of Toronto</span>, who maps and studies the factors that drive neighbourhood change. “Most consumers shop blindly, they don't know what is going on in different geographic areas.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To try to cut through that confusion and provide renters with a bit more insight on where neighbourhood prices are heading the Toronto Star built an interactive map showing how a big slice of the complex market — purpose-built rentals — have gone up in price. The yearly average rents were provided by the <span class="companylink">Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation</span>, which tracks and reports information on rental prices and vacancy rates. The Star used those numbers to calculate how much average market rent for purpose-built rentals in the 15 largest metropolitan areas across the country changed between 2012 and 2017.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Consumers, Hulchanski said, “need to be forewarned that over a five-year period that has been the change in rents,” in the neighbourhood they might want to live in. “A good consumer needs information and this is helpful information.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The map has a drop-down menu that allows users to check out the percentage increase on rent for bachelor, one-bedroom, two-bedroom and three-bedroom apartments, and the overall average. Not every type of apartment is included, as the map was built using data for occupied, privately-initiated, purpose-built rental buildings with three or more units. It does not capture, for example, basement apartments in Calgary, a two-bedroom unit at the top of a Montreal home, or a condominium for rent in Toronto. The map boundaries are based on groupings of census tracts used by <span class="companylink">Statistics Canada</span>. Neighbourhoods where data was not available for more than one year, on either end of the 2012 to 2017 range, are shaded grey.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hulchanski said the map can be used as a window into broader neighbourhood trends. People can see what tenants are already paying in a neighbourhood, and if those amounts have increased significantly over five years they can assume that actual rent would be far higher, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It will also, he said, give people who research housing policy another indicator into how gentrification and lack of new supply is affecting certain areas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“In the rental side there is mainly demand and it is not what economists could call effective market demand. That is, there are not enough people with enough money to pay for the rents that are required for new construction,” he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Shaun Hildebrand, president of market research firm Urbanation, also cautioned the numbers cannot be used to predict the actual cost of future rents.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“What the average tenant is paying is not what the average tenant would pay if they rented today,” because the rental prices CMHC reports are primarily for occupied units and people tend to hold on to those rental homes, he said. In terms of Toronto, he said, any significant spikes in price are likely attributed to landlords charging much higher prices for new or empty units, which are rare.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tim Ross, executive director of the Co-operative Housing Federation of Canada, said all data, historical or otherwise, is needed for effective conversations around housing. The federation used CMHC rental data to help demonstrate that co-operative housing is “bulletproof” to fluctuations in the rental market, he said. What the federation found was the cost of a one-bedroom co-operative unit in Toronto rose 7 per cent between 2013 and 2017, compared to a 16 per cent increase in a one-bedroom, purpose-built apartment in the same time period, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“If anything I would urge the federal government to invest in solutions we know work and are insulated from the current volatility of the rental markets and housing markets across the country,” Ross said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Local policy does make a difference. Tenant and landlord law is a provincial responsibility, so what goes in Toronto will differ from Halifax or Montreal. Vacancy rates and rental costs also rely on a range of factors, including local economic drivers like seasonal work in cities such as Calgary and Edmonton.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One way to learn how those policies impact broader housing health is through the Canadian Rental Housing Index[http://rentalhousingindex.ca/en/#intro], which maps out the percentage of income people in different areas are spending on rent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The need for better and more complete data on housing has been identified as a national priority. The federal government has pledged $241 million to be used towards research, data collection and outcomes over the next 10 years as part of the National Housing Strategy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New studies being conducted across Canada will include the Social and Affordable Housing Survey — Rental Structures. CMHC spokesperson Audrey-Anne Coulombe said the annual survey will collect information on rental costs, building services, wait lists and building condition.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To find out what is happening in rental markets in major cities across Canada, the Star reached out to housing experts to talk about past trends and what renters can expect in the future.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Halifax</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Halifax's rental market is tighter than it's been in more than a decade.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The vacancy rate for purpose-built rental stock with three or more units — the basis for the CMHC vacancy rates — in Halifax was 2.3 per cent in October 2017, according to the CMHC, the lowest since October 2003.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Star's analysis of purpose-built rental data shows most areas saw average rents for those units increase between 10 and 20 per cent from 2012 to 2017.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are some outliers, however.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Star's analysis shows average rent in the Woodside/Eastern Passage area, for example, increased 95.7 per cent in the same period. The increase was 43.7 per cent in Timberlea/Beechville and 55.7 per cent in Fairmount.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Neil Lovitt, senior manager of planning and economic intelligence at Halifax real estate consulting firm Turner Drake, said new construction likely skewed the numbers in those areas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“First of all, it's a small rental market to begin with, there's not a lot of units, so any new building is going to create a bigger splash,” he said, referring to Woodside/Eastern Passage. “The existing supply, which is maybe one or two hundred units, rent probably hasn't changed in those at all, but you're just adding in a comparatively large number of very new buildings that would obviously start at a much higher price.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“It tilts the average figure up quite significantly.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In general, Lovitt said the “addition of new, more expensive units into the market” explains much of the increase in average rents.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The older units have, up until very recently, not really seen that much rental growth,” he added.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lovitt said the perception that there's a construction boom in Halifax is a matter of visibility: the rate of construction hasn't changed, it's just moved downtown from the suburbs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Both he and the CMHC, in its 2017 report, cite strong immigration numbers as one reason for increasing rental demand in Halifax, especially over the last two to three years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“For the last couple years before that, we were building a lot and there was starting to be, I think, a bit of anxiety as to whether or not we were overbuilding,” Lovitt said. “And then these population trends have sort of come in to offer some support to that.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Whether the trend will continue is hard to predict, Lovitt said, as is the downward trend with the vacancy rate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“It depends on the pace of buildings being completed,” he said. “I guess you could say there's a race between supply and demand — basically, new construction and new residents.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">— Zane Woodford, StarMetro Halifax</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Toronto</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Toronto is rapidly becoming a city of glistening glass towers, although one with fewer and fewer affordable places to live.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What was considered somewhat accessible to the average renter, purpose-built stock hit a 1.1 per cent vacancy rate, according to the CMHC's 2017 rental market report.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The higher density zoning and rezoning that was once for rental housing, is now used for condo buildings,” said U of T's Hulchanski, explaining one factor behind Toronto's rental housing crunch. Condominium units do end up on the rental market, he said, but are aimed at people with higher incomes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Star's analysis of CMHC numbers on average cost for purpose-built rental units showed that in Toronto close to 20 neighbourhoods reported a 20 per cent or higher increase in average market rent between 2012 and 2017.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dana Senagama, CMHC manager of market analysis for the GTA, stressed those figures don't show average market movement, as they don't contain new builds and renovated units. Spikes do indicate how an ultra tight vacancy rate and lack of new supply can impact prices, she said, or gives a snapshot of overall market demand. “A landlord can't raise your rent unless somebody is willing to pay for it,” Senagama said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hulchanski said the map shows where gentrification is taking hold. One stark example, he noted, was the Dufferin Grove/Little Portugal area where the Star's analysis showed the average cost of a one-bedroom unit spiked 38.6 per cent between 2012 and 2016.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The area identified as South Parkdale/King West, where the Star's analysis showed a one-bedroom rose 9.8 per cent between 2012 and 2017, are also becoming increasingly desirable and the data reflects that, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Toronto, the rent on occupied units can only be raised a fixed amount set by the province each year. However, in November the provincial government ruled landlords could raise the rent on newly constructed units any amount — occupied or not.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Urbanation's Hildebrand said the actual demand for rental housing is close to 25,000 new units, each year. The GTA is on track to complete 20,000 condos next year, he said, of which half will end up as rentals, and up to 5,000 purpose-built units. There are close to 11,200 purpose-built rental units under construction, he said, about the same total amount built since 2005.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The level of purpose-built rental would need triple to move the market into balance,” he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">— Emily Mathieu, Toronto Star</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Calgary</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The city's rental market is starting to show signs of a recovery after years of units sitting empty in Alberta's slumping economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Calgary's vacancy rate had hovered at or below 1 per cent as the oil industry boomed in the mid-2000s. When the bottom fell out, the numbers gradually increased, hitting 7 per cent in October 2016 — the highest rate measured by the CMHC in more than 25 years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The rate inched down to 6.3 per cent in 2017 despite a construction boom that brought nearly 2,000 more new units into the market compared to the previous year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For industry watchers, those numbers point to larger trends.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The economy is growing, people are moving into the city,” said Lai Sing Louie, an economist with the housing corporation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With that, the CMHC is forecasting prices will again increase.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The recession's impact on rent played out differently in neighbourhoods across the city.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prior to the downturn, average rent was increasing almost everywhere. That trend flatlined in most neighbourhoods when the recession hit, but in looking at CMHC data for purpose-built rentals from 2012 to 2017, the Star's analysis shows some areas actually saw prices for those units dip.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">South Calgary's Canyon Meadows saw the biggest overall change with prices down 11.2 per cent in the five-year period, the analysis shows.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The discrepancies could be attributed to a key finding from CMHC surveys that collected information on renter behaviour.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Last year, one of the primary reasons for moving was for employment reasons,” Louie said. “That tends to create turnover and vacancy rates in different neighbourhoods at different times.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">— Andrew Jeffrey, StarMetro Calgary</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Edmonton</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Edmonton remains a renter's market thanks in part to the lingering effects of Alberta's oil-fuelled recession and a steady supply of new residential developments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The average vacancy rate for purpose-built rentals jumped from 2 per cent in 2014, when the recession started, to 4 per cent in 2015, according to the CMHC. It's since levelled off at 7 per cent for both 2016 and 2017.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Average rents, meanwhile, have generally continued to increase, albeit at a slower pace than before the economic meltdown with the price in some neighbourhoods practically holding steady between 2014 and 2016.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The city's rental market has been less affected than those in some other parts of the province. That could be attributed to a variety of factors, including strong demand from post-secondary students and the recession's overall lessened impact on Edmonton compared to cities with deeper ties to the oil industry, said James Cuddy, an Alberta analyst with CMHC.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are signs, however, that vacancy rates are starting to dip and prices are starting to climb faster as the recession wanes, Cuddy said. He expects that to be reflected in the housing corporation's 2018 report due out later this month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Core neighbourhoods such as Bonnie Doon, Grandin and McCauley started seeing average rent increase as early as 2016 because they are in high demand, Cuddy said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">— Omar Mosleh, StarMetro Edmonton</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Vancouver</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jill Atkey, CEO of the B.C. Non-Profit Housing Society, has been tracking not just the price of rent throughout the province but how income levels have failed to keep up with the rising cost of housing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While Vancouver has a reputation for unaffordable housing, Atkey says it's suburbs like Burnaby, Surrey and Coquitlam that have become the most unaffordable for renters.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Over the past five years, “we saw households spending more than 30 per cent — and more than 50 per cent — of their incomes on rent,” Atkey said. “So it really was becoming the new normal to be spending more than you can afford.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Average rent for purpose-built rentals in downtown Vancouver rose by 25.6 per cent between 2012 and 2017, according to a Toronto Star analysis of CMHC data. But in the District of Langley, on the far eastern edge of the Metro Vancouver region, rents rose by a whopping 68 per cent in the same time period.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And it's not just big cities where renters are feeling the pinch. Many smaller communities are also struggling with the same housing conundrum, Atkey said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The good news for renters, Atkey noted, is that with so many people feeling the effect of rising housing costs, the crisis became the top issue in recent provincial and municipal elections. Governments have started to invest in a big way with provincial funding just announced for 4,900 units targeted at low-to-moderate income renters across B.C.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Non-profit housing developers have another 7,000 units in development through other investments, Atkey said, and, for the first time in 30 years, many municipal governments are prioritizing new purpose-built rental buildings through development and fee incentives.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Atkey believes struggling renters will start to see a difference as these new projects are completed over the next two to four years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“They're struggling right now, so telling them two to four years from now that the struggle will be less severe is sort of cold comfort, but we are starting to turn the corner on this,” she said.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">ST. JOHN'S, N.L. — At least 15 oiled seabirds have been spotted after Newfoundland's largest-ever offshore oil spill, and one biologist says past spills indicate the number could be in the thousands.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">Husky Energy</span> reported the sightings on Wednesday and confirmed one dead bird since an estimated 250,000 litres of oil spilled into the ocean on Friday during an intense storm.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The SeaRose platform was attempting to restart production when there was an equipment failure in a subsea line that released the oil.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Experts on seabirds say an estimate on the number of birds killed from oiling could be months in the making, but is likely to grow.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Gail Fraser, a leading seabird biologist at York University, said even a small number of oiled bird sightings are cause for concern and are likely a sign of much wider harm.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The fact that they have found oiled birds means that there's probably a lot more oiled birds out there," Fraser said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prior oil spills have ended up with estimates of bird deaths that have grown into the thousands, she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 2004 Terra Nova spill that released 165,000 litres of oil into the ocean is estimated to have killed around 10,000 birds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The biologist noted the Terra Nova incident spilled less oil into the ocean, but it happened at the same time of year as the latest incident, meaning similar numbers of birds like murres and dovekies would have been in the area.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fraser said "millions" of birds migrate to the region from the Arctic around this time of year, and the weekend's rough conditions mean getting an accurate count of killed birds may be impossible.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The conditions were terrible and that makes it a challenge to get good estimates of how many seabirds might be killed," Fraser said. "It becomes kind of a hand-waving exercise and doing our best guess."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The region's birds are particularly sensitive to oil pollution, Fraser said. The birds can die of hypothermia if even a small amount of oil slicks their plumage.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They also have low reproduction rates and long lives, meaning a large hit to the population has a big impact.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fraser thinks these characteristics are not always reflected when companies are fined for hurting seabird populations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">Syncrude Canada</span> was fined $3 million in 2008 when more than 1,600 ducks were killed after landing in an Alberta tailings pond. By comparison, Petro-Canada was fined $290,000 for the Terra Nova spill believed to have killed 10,000 birds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"To kill 10,000 seabirds is a big deal ecologically and the fine should reflect that."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Scott Tessier, chief executive of the Canada-Newfoundland and Labrador Offshore Petroleum Board, said no oil sheens were spotted on the water on Monday or Tuesday, meaning the oil has likely broken down to the point that it cannot be cleaned up.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The board is now focused on wildlife monitoring and its investigation into the incident.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">Environment and Climate Change Canada</span> said in an emailed statement Thursday that trained wildlife observers are surveying the area daily to determine which areas around the spill are a priority for monitoring.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">Canadian Wildlife Service</span> will compile data to help build a damage assessment on wildlife populations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">World Wildlife Fund Canada</span> on Thursday called the spill "a stark reminder of the need for tougher regulations and stronger oversight" in the framework governing Canada's oil and gas activities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a statement, the group called for stronger regulations on spill prevention and response, a moratorium on new oil and gas licences in the Arctic and a ban on industrial development in marine protected areas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The statement addressed the risk to birds and fish, writing that oil exposure in adult female fish can lead to offspring deformities and cause internal damage to marine mammals like whales and dolphins.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The offshore boards have repeatedly assured the public that offshore operations are safe and there is nothing to worry about. This incident proves otherwise," wrote Sigrid Kuehnemund, <span class="companylink">WWF-Canada</span>'s vice president of oceans.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Crude oil is a poisonous substance and doesn't simply disappear. It sinks into the marine environment and continues to wreak havoc in the food chain."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are also concerns that the spill could pose a threat to the province's fishery.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The province's Fish, Food and Allied Workers union last week expressed concern the spill could threaten the fishery's standing in the global market if buyers fear tainted product.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"An oil spill off of our coast, whatever the magnitude and source, threatens the livelihood of those who depend on the fisheries," the union said in a statement.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The potential for socio-economic ramifications on the fishing industry cannot be ignored by industry and government."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Operators in Newfoundland's offshore industry are responsible for following their own safety and environmental plans, and the regulatory board monitors and investigates when necessary.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A conversation about housing has to start with numbers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Whether you're a tenant struggling to find a home or a government crafting new policy during a nationwide housing crisis, you need to have a grip on good data.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The hunt for rental housing, particularly in Toronto and Vancouver, has become increasingly competitive and confusing as the number of people looking to live in cities continues to outpace what is actually being built.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Renters going to shop for a place to rent have almost no information," said David Hulchanski, a housing and community development expert at the <span class="companylink">University of Toronto</span>, who maps and studies the factors that drive neighbourhood change. "Most consumers shop blindly, they don't know what is going on in different geographic areas."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To try to cut through that confusion and provide renters with a bit more insight on where neighbourhood prices are heading the Toronto Star built an interactive map showing how a big slice of the complex market - purpose-built rentals - have gone up in price. The yearly average rents come through the <span class="companylink">Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation</span>, which tracks and reports information on rental prices and vacancy rates. The Star used those numbers to calculate how much average market rent for purpose-built rentals in the 15 largest metropolitan areas across the country changed between 2012 and 2017.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hulchanski said the map can be used as a window into broader neighbourhood trends.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">People can see what tenants are already paying in a neighbourhood, and if those amounts have increased significantly over five years they can assume that actual rent would be far higher, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It will also, he said, give people who research housing policy another indicator into how gentrification and lack of new supply is affecting certain areas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"In the rental side there is mainly demand and it is not what economists could call effective market demand. That is, there are not enough people with enough money to pay for the rents that are required for new construction," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Shaun Hildebrand, president of market research firm Urbanation, also cautioned that the numbers cannot be used to predict the cost of future rents.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"What the average tenant is paying is not what the average tenant would pay if they rented today," because the rental prices CMHC reports are mostly for occupied units and people tend to hold on to those rental homes, he said. In terms of Toronto, he said, any significant spikes in price are likely attributed to landlords charging much higher prices for new or empty units, which are rare.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To find out what is happening in rental markets in major cities across Canada, the Star reached out to housing experts to talk about past trends and what renters can expect in the future.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Toronto</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Toronto is rapidly becoming a city of glistening glass towers, although one with fewer and fewer affordable places to live.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What was considered somewhat accessible to the average renter, purpose-built stock with three or more units - the basis for the CMHC vacancy rates - hit a 1.1 per cent vacancy rate, according to the CMHC's 2017 rental market report.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The higher density zoning and rezoning that was once for rental housing, is now used for condo buildings," said U of T's Hulchanski, explaining one factor behind Toronto's rental housing crunch. Condominium units do end up on the rental market, he said, but are aimed at people with higher incomes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Star's analysis of CMHC numbers on purpose-built rental units showed that in Toronto close to 20 neighbourhoods reported a 20 per cent or higher increase in average market rent between 2012 and 2017.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dana Senagama, CMHC manager of market analysis for the GTA, stressed those figures don't show average market movement, but spikes do indicate how an ultra tight vacancy rate and lack of new supply can impact prices or gives a snapshot of overall market demand. "A landlord can't raise your rent unless somebody is willing to pay for it," she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hulchanski said the map shows where gentrification is taking hold. One stark example, he noted, was the Dufferin Grove/Little Portugal area where the Star's analysis showed the average cost of a one-bedroom unit spiked 38.6 per cent from 2012 to 2016.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Areas like Parkdale and King West, where the Star's analysis showed a one-bedroom rose 9.8 per cent between 2012 and 2017, are also becoming increasingly desirable and the data reflects that, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Urbanation's Hildebrand said the GTA is on track to complete 20,000 condos next year, he said, of which half will end up as rentals, and up to 5,000 purpose-built units. There are close to 11,200 purpose-built rental units under construction, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The level of purpose-built rental would need to triple to move the market into balance," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">- Emily Mathieu, Toronto Star</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Halifax</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Halifax's rental market is tighter than it's been in more than a decade. The vacancy rate in Halifax was 2.3 per cent in October 2017, according to the CMHC, the lowest since October 2003.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Star's analysis of purpose-built rental data shows most areas saw average rents for those units increase between 10 and 20 per cent from 2012 to 2017.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are some outliers, however. The Star's analysis shows average rent in the Woodside/Eastern Passage area, for example, increased 95.7 per cent in the same period.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Neil Lovitt, senior manager of planning and economic intelligence at Halifax real estate consulting firm Turner Drake, said new construction likely skewed the numbers in those areas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In general, Lovitt said the "addition of new, more expensive units into the market" explains much of the increase in average rents.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Both he and CMHC cite strong immigration numbers as one reason for increasing rental demand in Halifax, especially over the last two to three years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">- Zane Woodford, StarMetro Halifax</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Calgary</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The city's rental market is starting to show signs of a recovery after years of units sitting empty in Alberta's slumping economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Calgary's vacancy rate had hovered at or below 1 per cent as the oil industry boomed in the mid-2000s.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When the bottom fell out, the numbers gradually increased, hitting 7 per cent in October 2016 - the highest rate measured by the CMHC in more than 25 years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The rate inched down to 6.3 per cent in 2017 despite a construction boom that brought nearly 2,000 more new units into the market compared to the previous year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For industry watchers, those numbers point to larger trends.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The economy is growing, people are moving into the city," said Lai Sing Louie, an economist with the housing corporation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prior to the downturn, average rent was increasing almost everywhere. That trend flatlined in most neighbourhoods when the recession hit, but in looking at CMHC data for purpose-built rentals from 2012 to 2017, the Star's analysis shows some areas actually saw prices for those units dip.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">- Andrew Jeffrey, StarMetro Calgary</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Edmonton</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Edmonton remains a renter's market thanks in part to the lingering effects of Alberta's oil-fuelled recession and a steady supply of new residential developments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The vacancy rate jumped from 2 per cent in 2014, when the recession started, to 4 per cent in 2015, according to the CMHC. It's since levelled off at 7 per cent for both 2016 and 2017.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Average rents, meanwhile, have generally continued to increase, albeit at a slower pace than before the economic meltdown.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The city's rental market has been less affected than those in some other parts of the province. That could be attributed to a variety of factors, including strong demand from post-secondary students and the recession's overall lessened impact on Edmonton compared to cities with deeper ties to the oil industry, said James Cuddy, an Alberta analyst with CMHC.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">- Omar Mosleh, StarMetro Edmonton</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Vancouver</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jill Atkey, CEO of the B.C. Non-Profit Housing Society, has been tracking not just the price of rent throughout the province but how income levels have failed to keep up with the rising cost of housing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While Vancouver has a reputation for unaffordable housing, Atkey says it's suburbs like Burnaby, Surrey and Coquitlam that have become the most unaffordable for renters.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Over the past five years, "we saw households spending more than 30 per cent - and more than 50 per cent - of their incomes on rent," Atkey said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Average rent for purpose-built rentals in downtown Vancouver rose by 25.6 per cent between 2012 and 2017, according to the Star's analysis of CMHC data. But in the District of Langley rents rose by a whopping 68 per cent in the same time period.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The global stock market retreat took a breather on Wednesday as a day of gains gave some relief to investors fixated on the latest outburst of volatility.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While stocks were well off their intraday highs by Wednesday's close, the S&P 500 gained 0.3 per cent for the day, while the S&P/TSX Composite Index – thanks largely to a bounce in energy stocks – rose 1.4 per cent. That only put a slight dent in the losses incurred over a turbulent fall season, which has been dominated by concerns about global growth, interest rates, stock valuations and – in Canada in particular – the lack of pipeline capacity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The on-again-off-again global sell-off has seen steep losses in technology, consumer and energy sectors lead the way for broad stock market declines.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">From peak to trough, the S&P 500 index dropped by 9.9 per cent over the past two months, avoiding correction territory by a hair, at least for now. The S&P/TSX Composite Index, however, surpassed the correction threshold last month with a top-tobottom decline of 11.1 per cent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Going into what is historically the strongest period of the year for both U.S. and Canadian stocks, we survey the damage of the correction so far.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">LOW-ENERGY SECTOR Several different forces conspired to drag Canadian energy stocks down to their lowest point since the global crash in oil prices started to fade 21/2 years ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A bottleneck in the pipeline network – made worse by the lack of progress in building new pipelines – combined with record levels of Canadian production, resulted in steep discounts on Alberta crude.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Then the world outlook for oil worsened. Declining global growth in the third quarter weighed on energy demand, while surging output has seen an oversupply return to the oil market. Oil traders, meanwhile, have amplified the slide in crude, National Bank economist Krishen Rangasamy wrote. “Speculators are reducing net long positions on oil at the fastest pace on record."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Domestic and external pressures combined to drag the price of Western Canadian Select down to as low as US$13.46 a barrel.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some large Canadian energy names sold off deeply in the process. After the sector tipped over in mid-July, <span class="companylink">Encana Corp</span>.'s shares declined by 46 per cent, <span class="companylink">Cenovus Energy Inc</span>. by 29 per cent, <span class="companylink">Canadian Natural Resources Ltd</span>. by 28 per cent and <span class="companylink">Suncor Energy Inc</span>. by 22 per cent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">PEAK IPHONE?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The latest red flag suggesting demand for iPhones is waning came on Wednesday amid rumours that smartphone assembler Foxconn was planning deep cost cuts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After peaking in early October, <span class="companylink">Apple Inc</span>.'s stock entered bear market territory with a decline of 23 per cent, nearly wiping out the stock's gains on the year. The rest of the FAANG cohort of high-flying tech stocks have been subject to dizzying selloffs of their own.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Beyond the FAANGs, the semi-conductor group as a whole has been hit by negative investor sentiment, as well as a glut in chip inventories. But the industry appears to have worked through excess supplies, while U.S. chip stocks now trade at heavy discounts to the software space, Martin Roberge, a portfolio strategist at Canaccord Genuity, said in a note. “Such discounts were last seen in 1996 and coincided with the end of an underperformance phase for chip stocks," he wrote.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">BIG BANKS HUNG IN THERE While each of the six largest Canadian bank stocks declined over the course of the TSX correction, the group fared better than the market with an average decline of about 7 per cent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Earnings season for the banks kicks off on Tuesday when <span class="companylink">Bank of Nova Scotia</span> is scheduled to report on its fourth-quarter performance. It is expected to be another quarter of double-digit bank profit growth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But several technical indicators point to a cautious approach at the banks, said Javed Mirza, an analyst at Canaccord Genuity. “The recent price action suggests further near-term weakness is in store."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The operator recently completed the second farm-in well, 100/01-04-64-6W6M well (the "01-04 Well"), with a 2900m horizontal leg in the Montney Formation. During the last 24 hours of a 200-hour production test, the 01-04 Well flowed 9.8 MMcf/d of natural gas and 1,124 bbls/d of condensate (2,770 boe/d). Although the early results from the 01-04 Well are encouraging they are not necessarily indicative of long-term performance or ultimate recovery.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The operator intends to tie-in the 01-04 Well to the pipeline currently under construction. Questerre will hold a royalty interest in the 01-04 Well subject to standard payout provisions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Michael Binnion, President and Chief Executive Officer of Questerre, commented, “With two wells testing at an average rate of 2,800 boe/d, we are proving up the potential of Kakwa North. One more farm-in well should spud early next year. Together with our recently acquired 17 sections, we are looking forward to developing this large contiguous block with our partner.”</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Barrel of oil equivalent ("boe") amounts may be misleading, particularly if used in isolation. A boe conversion ratio has been calculated using a conversion rate of six thousand cubic feet of natural gas to one barrel of oil and the conversion ratio of one barrel to six thousand cubic feet is based on an energy equivalent conversion method application at the burner tip and does not necessarily represent an economic value equivalent at the wellhead. Given that the value ratio based on the current price of crude oil as compared to natural gas is significantly different from the energy equivalent of 6:1, utilizing a conversion on a 6:1 basis may be misleading as an indication of value.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Liberal government released its fall fiscal update Wednesday, making the bold pre-election claim that the land is strong - even if it may not feel that way if you're trying to sell a house or work in the oilpatch.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In fairness things are going pretty well, on the back of surging demand from the U.S. But there appears to be a supreme confidence that it will be ever thus. Scant provision is being made for the recession rumbling towards us inexorably, like a winter storm.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The government gave itself a clean bill of health, pointing out GDP growth is forecast at two per cent for the next two years, before slowing to a still respectable 1.6 per cent. Unemployment is forecast to be below six per cent over the next two years, while the federal debtto-GDP ratio is predicted to continue to tick downward.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The government concluded its re-election pitch by claiming it has fulfilled a third of its mandate promises, with "progress made" on the other two-thirds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For a government heading back to the polls next year, it is, at first blush, a solid base from which to launch a campaign for another mandate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Finance Minister Bill Morneau said Wednesday that a middle-class family of four is now $2,000 better off, thanks mainly to the Canada Child Benefit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When it comes to specific measures the fall update, given the title "Investing in Middle-class Jobs," is a modest document, with much to be modest about.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But it did introduce a number of measures aimed at addressing U.S. President Donald Trump's corporate tax cuts, including tax incentives to encourage businesses to invest in new assets like machinery and equipment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The new plan will "give Canadians the help they need to succeed, making smart investments to grow our economy for the long-term, while we bring the books back towards balance," Morneau said - the first time anyone can recall a Liberal finance minister talking about balanced budgets since the days of Paul Martin, the deficit-slayer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On the basis of the spin, were an election held tomorrow there would be lineups at the polling booths to laud the Liberals for their incredible feats of economic alchemy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Needless to say, while the fiscal update tells the truth it doesn't tell the whole truth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tax revenues for the first six months of the fiscal year were up 10 per cent, or a whopping $13 billion, but growth is patchy. The housing market - for so long a driver of economic growth - has recorded three quarters of contraction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The oilpatch appears to be going through something of an existential crisis, as jobs and investment continue to bleed south of the border. In Financial Post this week, former Encana CEO Gwyn Morgan noted with alarm how his former company has "exported" itself to the U.S. He blamed Justin Trudeau and the Liberal government for a litany of bad policy decisions - from the oil tanker ban, to killing the Northern Gateway pipeline; from the introduction of "upstream emissions" in pipeline regulatory hearings to Bill C-69, the impact assessment act - that has all but killed Canada's most economically important industry.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The fall update offers little in the way of comfort for producers, or for Alberta's provincial government, faced as they are with a price differential that is reaching record highs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What it does contain is a range of tax changes to encourage business investment in Canada. Arguably, the measures should have been included in the spring budget, flush from the windfall of three-per-cent growth in 2017.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But since business investment and exports will be relied on to make a greater contribution to economic growth, it is timely that the Liberals have finally acknowledged that the golden goose won't keep laying without some encouragement. This has not been a government overly concerned with wealth generation during its first three years in office.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Business groups had called for Morneau to reduce the corporate income tax rate across the board but the finance minister deemed his room for manoeuvre was limited, given the need to keep the "fiscal anchor," the debt-to-GDP rate, ticking down. The new measures will cost $14 billion over the next five years, so this is not chump change. But the money appears to be targeted, since it allows Canada to market itself as the lowest marginal effective tax rate (METR) in the G7.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For many international companies, it is the METR, the cumulative rate of taxes that affect businesses, that is a key determinant of where they will invest.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is a creative solution that will help businesses write off assets in a range of industries at a faster rate - including intangibles like computer software - even if it doesn't address the specific problems facing the oil industry.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the very least, it is "investment" that may have a productive outcome - unlike many of the tax dollars that have been tossed hither and thither in the past three years. You only get it if you invest.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The real problem is that, for all the "confidence in Canada's economic future" the document expressed, a downturn is coming as surely as winter follows fall.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When it does, the debtto-GDP ratio will not keep falling, because GDP will shrink. That is when a reckoning will take place.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The measures announced in the fall update will add to a deficit that is set to remain in double figures as far out as the <span class="companylink">Department of Finance</span> projects.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The much-vaunted $2,000-a-year bonanza for the family of four is paid for with borrowed money. It is not just Conservatives who see that as a "raid on future generations."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For all the billions being added to the national debt, the benefits are not being felt by everyone.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These are the good times but for many people, they don't feel that good. The government boasts about rising wages but for the past three years, real wages averaged gains of just 0.3 per cent, versus one per cent for the previous decade.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rising interest rates are also making life tougher.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But there is none of this nuance in the sunny days document tabled by the government. In a self-assessment of their own brilliance, the Liberals judged their commitment to balance the budget by 2019-20 as a measure where action has been taken and "progress made," even if, sadly, it is "facing challenges."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That blatant nose-stretcher comes just 25 pages after the summary statement of transactions that says the deficit in 2019-20 will be $19.6 billion. Some progress, some challenge.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The entire document should come with a warning sticker: "Caution - stormy objects in your mirror are closer than they appear."</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Remember the last time Canadian energy CEOs, investors and industry commentators, even those famous for avoiding hyperbole, used words like "national emergency" to describe the state of their sector? Remember hearing them very publicly call out the federal government for its seeming indifference to Canadian energy jobs and investment under threat and in retreat? How about those who have for decades invested in the vital and entrepreneurial energy sector using words like "treasonous" to describe the federal government's action and inaction on the file. Do you remember that happening before? If you were born at the time of the last Leafs'Stanley Cup win or before, you might. You'd have been around for the elder Trudeau's assault on the West and Canada's energy sector in the form of the National Energy Program (NEP). And you'll know that what we are hearing now from the usually staid and circumspect energy-sector leaders is not without at least one historical precedent.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I was around then. I was that guy in high school who nerded out on all things political; from running for student council vice-president on a platform to install chalkboards in the bathrooms as an acceptable alternative to more permanent graffiti and mark-leaving, to all the happenings in provincial, federal and U.S. politics. I remember supper discussions when my otherwise calm and collected small businessman dad would become uncharacteristically animated discussing what the federal government was doing to the West.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I remember seeing hats emblazoned with the map and name of a brand-new and possible country, the Republic of Western Canada, being worn in numbers that rivalled the usual millinery fare: John Deere, Roughriders, Ford Trucks, Pilsner and Roughriders.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Largely in response to the NEP and fed by a growing belief that the federal government just didn't care about the West, the footings of this feeling found enough purchase to spawn a political party, the Western Canada Concept, sweep the Liberal party from Western Canada in the 1983 election and set the stage for the Reform party.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There is no NEP today, you might note. Or anything quite like it. True. There is not one initiative or program of government that is the root of the growing alienation. There is however a long list, the cumulative destructive effect of which is similar. And it all starts with pipelines.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Canadians own the natural resources. This would be Peter Lougheed's oftrepeated reminder to me when I would travel to Calgary to meet him. I was an opposition leader with a lot of questions for the possible day when I might have the other job. This was his reminder to me again when I sought his counsel during the <span class="companylink">Potash Corp</span>-BHP takeover affair. Canadians today are all but giving their heavy oil away. The discount that measures the gap between what every other country gets for similar oil and what you are getting for yours has now reached more than $40 per barrel.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The costs to Canada, to our ability to fund qualityof-life programs and transfer payments, to our investment climate and to jobs, are huge. The direct discount cost was estimated at $13 billion in the first 10 months of 2018 alone. The industry is in an emergency situation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CAPP, the <span class="companylink">Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers</span>, will tell you there are two principal reasons for the great Canadian oil giveaway today: lack of access to markets and that we have but one customer - the United States. These are two sides of the same coin. And this is at the core of the echoes of the NEP we're now experiencing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Liberals, with the support of the Alberta NDP, abandoned the Northern Gateway pipeline. Federal changes to regulations effectively killed Energy East. Canada has stuck to environmental regulations that the Americans are walking away from, putting our producers at a serious disadvantage. Keystone and Trans Mountain both remain viable in theory, but neither is anywhere close to completion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The net result of all this is as much as $60 billion in job-creating, social-programming-funding investment lost to our energy sector over the past 18 months. All the while, Eastern Canada continues to import its oil from such countries as Saudi Arabia, while Canadian product is warehoused for lack of pipelines.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">During the NEP, there was a dawning of understanding from the elder Trudeau, precipitated by premier Lougheed's curtailment legislation to effectively turn off the taps to Canada. Pierre Trudeau asked then-energy minister Jean Chrétien to consider some measure of adjustments to the NEP. The election of Brian Mulroney in 1983 made that moot, but there was still a moment of pragmatic reflection from the first Trudeau government.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Is there hope for a similar dawning in the minds of this current generation of federal Liberals? There's no sign of that yet. Indeed, against the backdrop of all the above, the government introduced Bill C-69 to create an entirely new environmental-impact assessment regime (just when we are close to figuring out the existing one). The energy sector has been very clear about this bill. Unchanged and enacted, it will make the construction of new pipelines in this country essentially impossible. The Liberal government has to date refused to make amendments or, better yet, withdraw the bill.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The dissonance is breathtaking and strongly suggests that this iteration of Trudeau Liberals may lack the pragmatism that provided solid economic and fiscal policies under Jean Chrétien and at least some circumspection by the Pierre Trudeau-led NEPers. Not this current crew. Not so far.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last week in Calgary, federal Natural Resources Minister Amarjeet Sohi betrayed a near complete disconnect from the travails of the energy sector, and all of Western Canada. He observed that, in the long run, greater pipeline capacity was the surest way to end the near giveaway of our energy products.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He's quite right of course.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But it's his government that has killed two pipelines and has introduced a bill that makes future pipelines unlikely. And we in the West, of course, recall the apparent Freudian utterance of the prime minister about his desire to "phase out" the oilsands, and that of his senior adviser, Gerald Butts, who said as recently as 2012 that he hoped there would be no hydro-carbon industry in Canada by 2050.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, I am hopeful.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Canadians must get involved, understanding that this sector provides for so much in our country that must surely be worthy of their engagement with the federal government to at least stop C-69.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But time is of the essence. I'm seeing those hats pop up again.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Alberta's fiscal policies are unsustainable." With this brusque, portentous declaration, University of Calgary economist Trevor Tombe commences his new overview of Alberta government finances. I promised myself I wouldn't make jokes about the professor erecting a Tombe-stone for the province, but his opening sentence does have the chilling quality of an epitaph.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Things are not quite as desperate as all that. Tombe takes much care to emphasize that his analysis of Alberta finances is not a prediction. When he calls the provincial government's spending habits "unsustainable" he means that, given reasonable assumptions about the future, current tax sources and rates will not be enough to prevent the treasury from entering a spiral of increasing deficits and increasing debt-servicing costs. Alberta, in other words, has a large presumptive "fiscal gap."</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The NDP government's 2018 provincial budget promised a "path to balance" that will see the current run of huge deficits reduced to zero by 2023. The problem, as Tombe sees it, is that other pressures on the budget will continue to build after that. The biggest is an aging population. Health-care costs are bound to outpace inflation and population growth as the worker-to-old-coot ratio diminishes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Unless there is a windfall, Alberta cannot really hope to preserve its combination of generous public spending and low taxes. And you've probably read some of our innumerable stories about Alberta experiencing the opposite of a windfall right now - receiving, by some estimates, virtually no dollar value at all from the bitumen being mined up north around Fort McMurray.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">All of this is familiar doctrine. So what's new? Tombe provides a firm estimate of the exact size of the fiscal gap, and puts it in historical context. He thinks that to close the gap through the year 2040, Alberta would need to increase government revenues or cut its program spending immediately by an amount equal to 2.7 per cent of GDP. "For perspective," the professor ads, "that means cutting government expenditures by $1 out of every $6 spent or introducing a 10 per cent sales tax."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Either choice is bound to make one wince. (Albertans aren't keen on the idea of an any-per cent-at-all sales tax.) But it is not, after all, an either-or choice. Tombe spends a lot of time making this point - that the gap can be handled by a mix of smooth tax increases and slow but steady spending cuts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He mentions only in passing that Alberta has done this sort of thing before. Ralph Klein's feverish costcutting shrank the government's program expenditures from 21 per cent of Alberta GDP to 13 per cent in three years. The fiscal gap could be fully addressed by spending cuts only onethird that size.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are exactly two kinds of Albertan. There's the kind whose instinctive reaction to this news will be to say "Yee-haw! Give 'er!" And there's the kind that will turn white as a sheet at the idea of program spending cuts even one-third as severe as those of the early Klein years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is hard to say which kind would win in an electoral fight nowadays; but the truth is that Klein trimmed an awful lot of low-hanging fruit, and spending cuts would be more difficult and more painful now, dollar for dollar. The aging of the Alberta population (or anyone's) inflates the cost of elder care and health even as it turns taxpayers into pensioners. Health care alone already consumes close to 90 per cent of all the tax paid to the Alberta government in a year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tombe's paper is useful for outlining the size of the problem, and should help set the agenda for Alberta's 2019 general election. But it is also interesting to scrutinize the assumptions involved in building a model of the Alberta budget. (It is also a little annoying that the work is being left to the academy.) One finds oneself thumbing through Tombe's article for a metaphorical magic wand or spell. The Oil Boom Fairy might always arrive again, as he observes, and she does have the ability to make nonsense of his intimidating numbers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">His fiscal gap estimate also assumes no special increase in federal government transfers to provinces. Alberta's treasury, assessed against the background of its GDP, is still healthier than those of her siblings: Tombe's scary baseline scenario would actually see Alberta's debt-to-GDP level hit those of today's Quebec only in 2040. This could mean that the federal government will have to increase transfers in order to bail out Alberta's neighbours before Alberta's own need becomes too desperate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But counting on Ottawa to take politically selfless budget action is probably just as foolish as dreaming of $200 oil.</p>

They had everything to do with the hard work of First Nations, the Province of British Columbia, logging companies and other business interests, environmental organizations, and local communities to protect biodiversity in one of the most unique places on Earth while providing new economic opportunities in the region.

</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It was Prime Minister Justin Trudeau himself who said in January 2017: "We can't shut down the oilsands tomorrow.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We need to phase them out. We need to manage the transition off of our dependence on fossil fuels.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"That is going to take time. And, in the meantime, we have to manage that transition."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He said that to a friendly audience in Peterborough, Ont. A few days later he was in Calgary, where criticism had erupted.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Asked about his comments, he said, "um, I misspoke ... I said something the way I shouldn't have said it."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Trudeau didn't say he'd been wrong. He just wished, it seemed, that he hadn't made himself so obvious.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The key word in Trudeau's Peterborough remarks was "manage." As in, "we have to manage that transition."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That's what the Liberals have been doing since being elected in 2015.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Their goal isn't to shutter Alberta's main industry tomorrow. They see it as a multi-decade thing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But managing an industry down is kind of like nudging a toboggan at the top of a steep hill.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Give it a little push and it might slide a short way. Or it might suddenly speed up, run loose and smash into a tree.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That is suddenly happening.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Liberals may get the moribund industry they envision - about a generation early.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The crash in prices for Alberta oil and bitumen is a direct result of Liberal hostility to both the Northern Gateway and the Energy East pipelines.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Those ideologically motivated moves left just one option for offshore export.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Boxed in, increasingly reliant on overstressed rail, beset by unending hostility in B.C. and berated by U.S. competitors, the typical barrel of Alberta oil now sells for a fraction of world prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We're at the stage where some producers (not refiners) are willing to shut in their own barrels in order to drive prices back up.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And that, of course, is exactly what the anti-oilsands people want; a product so valueless that it's simply left in the ground.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Investors might see this crisis as a cyclical thing, maybe even a good moment to invest before energy starts roaring again.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But hardly anybody expects a quick relaunch.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">How could they, when virtually every industry and investment expert says Bill C-69 will make construction of future pipelines virtually impossible? How could they, when Trans Mountain is mired in the latest round of <span class="companylink">NEB</span> hearings and will inevitably face more court challenges after construction restarts? How could they, when Bill C-48 isn't a North Coast tanker ban at all, but an export ban on Alberta's refined products? (Under C-48 the world's biggest tanker is free to land at Kitimat, B.C., as long as it doesn't load a long list of Alberta's primary and refined products.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The whole plan - Liberal as well as Alberta NDP - has been to replace oil and gas with a variety of green and upgraded products.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CALGARY, Alberta, Nov. 21, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- <span class="companylink">Titanium Corporation Inc</span>. (the “Company” or “Titanium”) (TSX-V: TIC) today released its results for the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2018. The Company changed its year end to December 31 from August 31 on January 24, 2018 and, as a result, is reporting its third quarter end as at September 30, 2018 in the new fiscal year.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Company has continued to make excellent progress on commercialization of its CVW™ technology at <span class="companylink">Canadian Natural Resources Limited</span>'s (“Canadian Natural”) Horizon oil sands site. Front End Engineering Design (“FEED”), the first step in project planning and engineering is well advanced and the Company has successfully completed Milestone 3 under the contribution agreement entered into with Emission Reduction Alberta (“ERA”) on October 19, 2017 (the “ERA Contribution Agreement”). The Federal and Alberta governments continue to prioritize climate change reduction, innovation, clean technology and economic diversification with a number of announced funding programs. The Company is in the process of qualifying for a number of these provincial and federal funding programs for ongoing phases of the project.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Highlights for the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2018 and recent months include:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">* The Company continued with the project execution phase working with Canadian Natural and the engineering firms Stantec and IHC Robbins on the FEED and associated studies. Third-party engineering commenced in April 2018 and is expected to be completed by the end of 2018 with the overall FEED project to be completed in early 2019. The Company has also retained consultants and technical firms to assist with other aspects of the engineering design and associated planning including project management, regulatory approvals, aboriginal engagement and minerals marketing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">* On October 30, 2018, the Company announced the achievement of Milestone 3 of the FEED phase of its CVW™ Horizon project. ERA funding is provided in stages during the project as the Company meets and reports against predetermined milestones established under the ERA Contribution Agreement. Direct project and in-kind costs incurred up to September 30, 2018 were $6.4 million. ERA and Canadian Natural contributions for their share of eligible project expenditures was $5.5 million, of which $0.6 million represents a 20% ERA holdback payable upon the completion of the project and final project reporting. The holdback will be received by the Company upon completion of agreed milestones outlined in the ERA Contribution Agreement. Project activities during the Milestone 3 period included the completion of full mechanical equipment lists including datasheets and specifications with the identification of long lead equipment listings for both the primary concentrator plant (“CP”) and the minerals separation plant (“MSP”). Piping and instrumentation diagrams (P&IDs) were completed and the relevant control system architecture for each of the CP and MSP were issued for review. The Company previously announced the successful achievement of Milestones 1 and 2 on May 15, 2018 and August 17, 2018, respectively.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">* The Company commissioned and has received an independent minerals market study and has been actively engaged with the minerals industry including meeting industry participants and prospective customers and participating in the Zircon Industry Association 2018 Conference held in Bangkok in September 2018 and the titanium and zircon minerals industry TZMI 2018 Congress held in Singapore in November 2018.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">* The Company has been meeting with Canadian investment banks regarding their potential participation in the structuring and financing of the project and their support of the Company in financial markets. The Company, in consultation with outside experts, is executing an active investor outreach campaign to communicate the Company's investment story to a wider investor audience.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">* The Company has an active program to communicate its technology and project to, and engage with, government, industry, the public and the investment community. Most recently, the Company participated by invitation in the Canadian Chamber of Commerce 2018 Hill Day in Ottawa in October 2018, where Canada's business community, parliamentarians and federal officials came together for the shared goal of building a Canada that wins. The discussions included innovation, climate sector policy and resource competitiveness and international trade diversification, trade and transportation infrastructure, economic capacity building for indigenous peoples and tax competitiveness. Earlier in the year, the Company participated by invitation in several technology and business forums including: the Federal Government Economic Strategy Table on "Innovation and Growing Firms to Scale" which focused on the support and financing of clean technologies; the Globe 2018 Forum which featured a Leadership Summit for Sustainable Business and an Innovation Expo; B7 meetings in Quebec City, where roundtables of business leaders from all of the G7 countries included the topics Scaling up Small Business and Climate Change and Resource Efficiency; the OCE Discovery Conference in Toronto, Canada's leading innovation-to-commercialization conference to showcase leading edge technology and bring together key players from industry, academia, government and the investment community.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">* During the first nine months of the 2018 fiscal year, there were further stock option and warrant transactions that resulted in cash proceeds of $1.2 million to the Company. On January 10, 2018, management exercised 450,000 stock options set to expire in April 2018 for proceeds to the Company of $450,000. On February 16, 2018, Mossco Capital Inc., an affiliated Canadian resident corporation controlled by Mr. Moss Kadey, exercised in full its 1,000,000 non-transferable common share purchase warrants at a price of $0.70 per share which resulted in the issuance of 1,000,000 common shares of Titanium for proceeds of $700,000 to the Company.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">* The Company is continuing cash conservation programs including those under which certain executive officers receive a portion of their compensation in restricted share units of the Company and all directors have elected to receive their annual retainers and meeting fees in deferred share units of the Company, to both conserve cash and further align themselves with shareholder interests. NEXT STEPS</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Implementing Titanium’s technology would require concentrator facilities to be built at an oil sands site which integrate with existing oil sands operations. Separate minerals separation facilities would be constructed to process heavy mineral concentrates into final minerals products. The facilities may be jointly owned and operated along with oil sands operators or other strategic partners. The Company has advanced proposals and flexible business models whereby customers may elect to license technology and build certain aspects of the facilities or elect to have the Company, together with partners, build and operate these facilities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Company is acting as the lead proponent and overall project manager for the FEED project, working in close collaboration with Canadian Natural and ERA. In this role, the Company is responsible for contracting with the outside engineering and other firms required for the project, managing and funding these outside contracts, project controls, reporting progress against agreed milestones and collecting partner funding contributions upon milestone achievement from ERA and Canadian Natural.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The engineering design is at an advanced stage and is expected to be completed by the end of 2018 with the overall FEED project to be completed in early 2019. During the engineering design phase, the Company and Canadian Natural have undertaken a number of related commercialization activities including: pursuing available Federal and Alberta government funding programs and other sources of funding for the potential construction phase of the project; working with the Alberta government to develop a competitive fiscal structure for the project including new minerals products; minerals market development activities, and working with potential partners interested in participating in the project. Following completion of the FEED project in early 2019, post-FEED project activities are expected to include the continuation of minerals evaluation and testing; engineering optimization, including refining the project scope, and the evaluation of capital and operating costs. The Company expects to file regulatory applications for the proposed project and continue engagement with Indigenous communities. Subject to the successful completion and evaluation of results from the FEED project and post-FEED project activities, the Company and Canadian Natural’s next steps would include making a final investment decision, including finalizing the business model, potential partners, commercial structure and financing plans and proceeding with the potential detailed engineering and construction of the facilities that would take approximately 30 months. Commercial structuring and financing for the project in 2019 will include the finalization of government due diligence related to grant applications and pursuing project financing from Government agencies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">FINANCIAL OVERVIEW</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Titanium is focused on achieving long-term financial success by implementing its innovative CVW™ technologies for commercial operations at oil sands sites. The Company is now working on engineering design for potential implementation of its technology at Canadian Natural’s Horizon site. However, until commercial arrangements and investment decisions are made, and facilities are constructed and operating, the Company expects to continue to incur losses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Net Loss – Net loss for the three-month period ended September 30, 2018 was $2.0 million, or $0.02 per share, compared to $0.7 million, or $0.01 per share, for the three-month period ended August 31, 2017. Net loss for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2018 was $6.6 million compared to $2.3 million for the nine-month period ended August 31, 2017. The net loss was higher in both the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2018 compared to the three and nine-month periods ended August 31, 2017 due to project and staffing costs for the engineering design project underway at Canadian Natural’s Horizon site that commenced in October 2017. The Company recognized $1.8 million of government and partner contributions during the three-month period ended September 30, 2018 and $2.3 million for the nine-month period ending September 30, 2018 for the engineering design project. In addition, $1.2 million was received from ERA on November 16, 2018 for its contribution related to the costs incurred up to September 30, 2018 for the successful completion of Milestone 3 of the project. The funding contributions from ERA and Canadian Natural are recognized as a recovery of project costs upon achievement of the agreed milestones contained in the ERA Contribution Agreement and collection of cash. For a development stage company, the net loss was in line with expectations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Research & Development (“R&D”) – For the three-month period ended September 30, 2018, R&D expenses net of recoveries was $1.4 million compared to $0.3 million higher by $1.1 million due to the engineering design project compared to the corresponding three-month period ended August 31, 2017. While total expenses were higher due to increased staffing and the Company’s contribution towards engineering design for Canadian Natural’s Horizon site, the Company will recover an estimated $2.1 million of the direct project and staffing costs incurred up until September 30, 2018 with the achievement of Milestone 3 which will reduce the net overall R&D expenditures in the next quarter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">General & Administrative (“G&A”) – G&A expense was $0.5 million for the three-month period ended September 30, 2018 as compared to $0.5 million for the three-month period ended August 31, 2017. While there was no change in G&A expenses overall there were some increases in certain categories related to compensation and benefits for management where the board has reinstated cash compensation for contracted salaries and portions of incentive pay. This increase in cash compensation was offset by a decrease in deferred compensation as the amount of annual incentive estimated for settlement with restricted share units is expected to be offset by an increase in cash compensation. In addition, investor relations expense was higher for the three-month period ended September 30, 2018 compared to the three-month period ended August 31, 2017 as the Company commenced an active program in February 2018 with Loderock Advisors Inc. to communicate its technology and the project to the public and the investor community. G&A costs included $0.2 million of non-cash equity-based compensation for the three-month period ended September 30, 2018 consistent with the three-month period ended August 31, 2017. The Company continued its equity in lieu of cash compensation plans for directors and certain officers during the current period.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Cash Position – The Company had $2.2 million of cash consisting of interest-bearing cash accounts at September 30, 2018 as compared to $5.0 million at December 31, 2017. The decrease in cash of $2.8 million relates to funding project costs in advance of collecting government and partner contributions in addition to the Company’s contribution for its share of project costs. In addition to the $2.3 million recognized as project cost recovery for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2018, the Company will receive $2.1 million for costs incurred during the third milestone period ended on September 30, 2018. On October 30, 2018, the Company announced the successful completion of Milestone 3 and received $1.2 million on November 16, 2018 from ERA as its share of project costs incurred up to September 30, 2018. The balance of $0.9 million in project cost recovery is expected to be received in the next quarter. During the nine-month period ended September 30, 2018, proceeds of $1.2 million were received from the exercise of warrants ($0.7 million) and the exercise of stock options ($0.5 million). The Company has sufficient cash and funding contribution commitments from ERA and Canadian Natural to fund the remainder of the engineering design project commitment. The Company is currently evaluating financing options including the outstanding common share purchase warrants that are due to expire December 21, 2018 to provide further cash proceeds to support the Company through a final investment decision for a commercial project.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“But if we have irresponsible leadership that just kicks the deficit can down the road, eventually the debt interest costs would be so great that there would have to be, further down the road, deeper cuts,” Kenney said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When asked about Alberta's health-care system compared to British Columbia's and Quebec's, Kenney said future collective bargaining agreements will need to be done better.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I'm reflecting on the last 15 years of collective bargaining agreements where we ended up with the highest labour costs in the country, by far, in terms of the public sector,” said Kenney. “And so my view is the government of British Columbia was much more careful in negotiating collective bargaining agreements.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Kenney said there needs to be more private options for people in the health-care system.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We must have a universal, publicly insured system where nobody has to pay out of pocket for care,” he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“But we already have a mix of private providers, and people go in to, for example, a medical clinic to see their GP — they're going into a private system that is bidding into the public system, so we're talking about applying the same logic.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Kenney's transition team is being led by his chief of staff, Jamie Huckabay, and will also be looking at who they want to bring in for staffers, and spots on commissions and boards.</p>
