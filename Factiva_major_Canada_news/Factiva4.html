<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Qatar, a member since 1961, is leaving to focus on its liquefied natural gas production, Energy Minister Saad Sherida Al-Kaabi told a news conference in Doha on Monday.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He didn't mention the political backdrop to the decision: dire relations with Saudi Arabia, which has led a blockade against his country since 2017; and a rhetorical onslaught from U.S. President Donald Trump against the cartel.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The symbolism is profound," said Helima Croft, commodities strategist at <span class="companylink">RBC Capital Markets LLC</span> and a former analyst at the Central Intelligence Agency.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Given that the concentrating on LNG should not be incompatible with <span class="companylink">OPEC</span> membership, the move will invariably lead many to conclude that the geopolitical divisions had become too intractable."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A spokesman for the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries declined to comment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Qatar is <span class="companylink">OPEC</span>'s 11th-biggest oil producer, accounting for less than two per cent of total output, so its departure may not have a significant impact on discussions this week to cut production in conjunction with allies including Russia. Yet it sets a troubling precedent for a group that prides itself on putting shared economic interests above external politics.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even through extreme events like the Iran-Iraq War in the 1980s or Saddam Hussein's 1991 invasion of Kuwait, producers still saw the benefits of retaining their membership and cooperating on oil policy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Qatar's departure in far less severe circumstances is testament to the declining influence of <span class="companylink">OPEC</span> in its historical form.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since non-members started cooperating with the group in 2016, direct talks between Russia and Saudi Arabia often bypass the cartel's traditional decisionmaking process.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The surge in North American oil production has also shifted the balance of power away from the Middle East.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As crude rallied by the most since June on Monday, the cause lay not with <span class="companylink">OPEC</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The market was reacting to an oil deal between Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman and Russian President Vladimir Putin at the <span class="companylink">Group of 20</span> meeting in Buenos Aires, and also Alberta's decision to order an unprecedented output cut.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The withdrawal of Qatar from <span class="companylink">OPEC</span> is a wise decision, as this organization has become useless and does not bring us anything," Hamad bin Jassim bin Jaber Al Thani, a former prime minister and member of the country's ruling family, said on <span class="companylink">Twitter</span>. "It is just being used for purposes that harm our national interest."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Qatar is a minnow in oil and a giant in natural gas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Counting both its production of crude and condensate - a form of ultra-light oil - the nation pumps about one million barrels a day, less than a 10th of Saudi Arabia's output. In the 2016 production-cuts deal between <span class="companylink">OPEC</span> and nonmembers including Russia, Qatar made a reduction of 30,000 barrels a day, just 1.7 per cent of the total.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Quitting <span class="companylink">OPEC</span> is largely symbolic for Qatar," said Amrita Sen, chief oil analyst at consultant Energy Aspects Ltd. in London.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Its oil production has been steady with limited prospects for increases."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Add in natural gas, supplied to its neighbours by pipeline and globally as LNG, and the nation's output rises to the equivalent of 4.8 million barrels of oil a day, with plans to expand that to 6.5 million, according to Al-Kaabi.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Achieving our ambitious strategy will undoubtedly require focused efforts, commitment and dedication to maintain and strengthen Qatar's position as the leading LNG producer," Al-Kaabi said in a statement. "I would like to reaffirm Qatar's pride in its international standing at the forefront of natural gas producers, and as the biggest exporter of LNG."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Relations within <span class="companylink">OPEC</span> are sometimes frayed and observers have often speculated that the group could fracture. Yet oil ministers from Iran and Iraq continued to attend the same meetings even as their nations fought a bloody war that included the use of chemical weapons.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the mid-1990s, Venezuela appeared at times on the brink of pulling out.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some U.S. right-wing politicians also tried to convince Iraq to withdraw after the 2003 invasion, but Baghdad resisted the pressure.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Iran and Saudi Arabia have been bitter regional rivals for many years, backing opposite sides in civil wars in Syria and Yemen, but have still been able to negotiate compromises within the group's Vienna headquarters.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the history of the cartel, three nations have left the organization, although two later re-joined. Most recently, Indonesia suspended its <span class="companylink">OPEC</span> membership because its status as a net importer of oil made joining the 2016 production cuts impractical.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The professional watchers of <span class="companylink">Canada's central bank</span>, so confident in their nearterm outlooks a month ago, turned tentative as November turned into December. A slew of recent events and releases, including the acute weakness of Canadian crude prices, have rattled the consensus that interest rates will be higher by January, if not as soon as Wednesday.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A close reader of Citibank's Dana Peterson research notes will see the earth shifting beneath her feet. On Nov. 23, she reviewed Canada's latest inflation numbers and advised her clients to get ready for an interest-rate increase at the <span class="companylink">Bank of Canada</span>'s first policy announcement of 2019, scheduled for Jan. 9. Peterson sounded much less certain a week later, when <span class="companylink">Statistics Canada</span> reported that a drop in business investment had slowed economic growth in the third quarter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We expect that hikes will continue, with the next in January, although with potential risk that a hike is delayed," she warned in a note published last week.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When Poloz and his deputies on the Governing Council raised the benchmark rate a quarter point to 1.75 per cent in October, many analysts decided the <span class="companylink">Bank of Canada</span> had turned "hawkish," a term traders use to describe central banks that favour raising interest rates over lowering them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They based this determination on the central bank's decision to stop modifying its plan to take borrowing costs higher as "gradual."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Carolyn Wilkins, the senior deputy governor, stated explicitly that "gradual" was erased because too many traders were beginning to assign the word meaning it didn't deserve. Regardless, a narrative took hold that the central bank was speeding up its walk back to a more normal policy setting.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"For a central bank that says it wants to eschew 'forward guidance,'the <span class="companylink">Bank of Canada</span> sounded pretty sure of itself when in hiked rates in October," Avery Shenfeld, chief economist at CIBC World Markets, said in a note on Monday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Shenfeld overstates the central bank's cockiness. Seeking a new way to describe its outlook, it decided to state that the economy had strengthened enough that a return to a neutral rate - between 2.5 per cent and 3.5 per cent - had become a realistic possibility.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">("Neutral" for central bankers is a theoretical zone in which borrowing costs create neither a headwind nor a tailwind for the economy.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That was always the goal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Poloz and Wilkins stressed that they remained unsure of how long it would take to get there because the economy was in an unusual state of flux.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The outlook remains unsettled. There is momentum, but the question is whether the economy is cruising, chugging, or decelerating.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Our confidence in Canada is significant," Andrew Williams, chief executive of DHL International GmbH's Brampton, Ont.-based Canadian unit, told me in a telephone interview on Nov. 19.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">DHL</span> had recently announced that it had added a new daily direct flight to Vancouver from its main North American sorting facility in Cincinnati to keep up with demand.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It also this year expanded the size of its warehouse in Winnipeg by seven times its original dimensions, to 27,000 square feet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Absolutely, there is strength in the global economy," Williams said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Poloz likes anecdotal evidence, so he could be comforted to hear that one of the world's biggest delivery companies is feeling good about things. The <span class="companylink">Bank of Canada</span> is counting on exports and business investment to drive economic growth over the next couple of years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Both wobbled this summer, according to <span class="companylink">StatCan</span>'s latest numbers. Services exports, for example, declined for the first time since 2014 in the third quarter, raising questions about whether the Trump administration's trade wars are starting to weigh on the global economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There are a few more clouds on the horizon," Mark Chandler, head of Canadian rates strategy at <span class="companylink">RBC Dominion Securities</span>, said in a research note Nov. 30.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another one of those clouds is oil.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Chandler, Shenfeld and others expect the <span class="companylink">Bank of Canada</span> will say more about the depressed price of Canadian crude this week, either in its policy statement, or when Poloz updates the central bank's outlook in a speech in Toronto on Dec. 6.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Weaker oil prices are taking a human toll in Alberta. That will matter to central bank. At the impersonal level of data, reduced income from exports will hurt exports, reduce corporate profits and curb investment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But it is unclear the extent to which the situation in the oilpatch will affect policy that must be made for the entire country, especially now that the Alberta government has ordered oil companies to limit production.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The central bank said in October that it expected the price gap would narrow as idled refineries in the U.S. come back on line. Poloz also has been philosophical about the situation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While lamenting the transportation bottlenecks, he also has said that lower prices were to be expected after the price surge that followed the Great Recession.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We would expect the industry to grow slower," Poloz said during testimony at the Senate banking committee on Oct. 31.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We have to bear in mind that the economy will not go back to where it was in 2013."</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Alberta's mandatory cut in oil production is likely to succeed in driving up Canadian crude prices in coming months, but the "heavy-handed" intervention will not alleviate longerterm issues facing the oilpatch, analysts said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Sunday Alberta Premier Rachsel Notley introduced a production cut of roughly 325,000 barrels per day, or just under nine per cent of the Alberta market, as a way to curb the recordhigh oil price discount faced by Canadian producers. The curbs will begin January 2019.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Alberta government hopes to roughly cut in half the 35 million barrels of oil currently sitting in storage across the province - a reduction that analysts said could be achieved in a matter of months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"You get there by next spring, which is very quick," said Michael Tran, analyst at RBC Capital Markets in New York.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"While 325,000 barrels per day is not going to meaningfully impact the global oil balance, it's extremely influential for really kickstarting Canadian oil prices," Tran said, adding that the cuts were a "heavyhanded mechanism" to raise prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Western Canadian Select, the heavy oil benchmark in Canada, soared nearly 37 per cent on Notley's announcement, up to US$29.95 per barrel, according to Bloomberg data, with the blend trading in the low US$20 range below the U.S. crude, compared to US$32 before the announcement.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Rory Johnston, analyst at Scotiabank in Toronto, said the cuts could narrow the discount for WCS to about US$20 in the first quarter of 2019, from an earlier estimate of US$29.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The decision by Notley to curb oil supplies marks the most substantial market intervention in decades, and comes after discounts for Canadian heavy oil breached US$50 in recent months, the highest on record.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Alberta's pipeline woes have spurred governments to seek out ways to help get their oil to market. Notley also recently announced the province would buy 120,000 barrels per day of rail capacity to move more barrels to refineries. In August, Ottawa bought the Albertato-British Columbia Trans Mountain pipeline from <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan Inc</span>., although a court ruling has halted construction on the project.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While producers said they would comply with the mandatory cuts, executives from Canada's <span class="companylink">Suncor Energy Inc</span>., <span class="companylink">Husky Energy Inc</span>. and <span class="companylink">Imperial Oil</span>, integrated producers with domestic refinery and upgrading capacity, expressed disappointment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We believe the market is working and view government-ordered curtailment or other interventions as possibly having serious negative investment, economic and trade consequences," Husky said in a statement.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Suncor said that price differentials were already narrowing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Suncor believes the market is the most effective means to balance supply and demand and normalize differentials," it said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">However, other major producers such as <span class="companylink">Cenovus Energy Inc</span>. and <span class="companylink">Canadian Natural Resources Ltd</span>. were vocal in their support.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"At $35 or $45 differentials - the lion's share of companies in this industry are barely breaking even or actually losing money," Cenovus chief executive Alex Pourbaix said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"When you are just breaking even or you are actually losing money, you can do nothing other than the bare minimum ... It's pure survival mode."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Alberta's intervention also comes just after a sharp nosedive in global oil prices last month, prompting the <span class="companylink">Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries</span> to consider cutting as much as 1.3 million barrels per day of production, according to news reports. The group is set to meet in Vienna this week.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A wider-spread collapse in oil prices could wash away much of the gains from Alberta's production cuts, several analysts said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It should always be kept in mind that oil is a global industry, and moves in the benchmark WTI price can outweigh changes in the spread, leaving Canadian producers in the lurch," said Brian DePratto, a senior economist at <span class="companylink">TD Bank Group</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">DePratto expects the production cuts to reduce Canadian real GDP growth by between 0.1 per cent and 0.2 per cent in 2019. In Alberta, the impact could be much higher, between 0.6 per cent and 1.3 per cent over the same period.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Jackie Forrest, senior director at the ARC Energy Research Institute in Calgary, said some companies should have invested in rail capacity sooner to help ease pipeline shortages. Still, she said many pipeline delays were hard to predict amid assurances by industry and government that pipelines could be successfully built to tidewater.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Industry as a whole should have a lot more rail capacity than we do right now, and we should have thought about it years in advance," she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Alberta's decision will "clear the supply glut a lot faster than it would have without intervention," Forrest said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The production curbs will provide some cushion for producers, but will not completely eliminate the discount on heavy Canadian oil that has persisted for many years, said Jihad Traya, manager at energy consultancy firm Solomon Associates LLC in Calgary. Canadian producers have for years accepted lower prices for their crude, particularly recently, as demand for highsulphur, heavy crudes continues to weaken.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Pipelines only solve one component of this," Traya said.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That's one of the takeaways from Canada's Food Price Report for 2019. The report was released Tuesday and forecasts what Canadians are likely to pay for their food in the coming year.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A collaboration between <span class="companylink">Dalhousie University</span> and the <span class="companylink">University of Guelph</span>, this marks the first time in the report's nine-year history that meat and seafood prices are forecast to drop.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The report's authors suggest the dip in meat prices is due in part to a forecasted and continued decline in demand. They also “strongly believe” meat prices will continue to “spiral downwards” until 2020 as Canadian consumers continue to reduce or eliminate their meat consumption.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Since we're in Nova Scotia I think that 2019 is a year of opportunity,” said Dalhousie University professor Sylvain Charlebois, one of the report's lead authors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“There's going to be a lot of consumers out there looking for alternative sources of protein, and we are expecting fish and seafood to attract more consumers by offering affordable prices.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When it comes to vegetables, Canadian consumers are looking at an increase of four to six per cent in the coming year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Last year we were predicting the same thing and it did happen, unfortunately,” he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Charlebois said the anticipated hike in vegetable prices can be linked to climate change, with global agriculture expected to remain “highly vulnerable” to severe weather patterns. While El Nino will likely bring heavier precipitation to South America and Asia, he said North America is expected to suffer drier conditions which could lead to reduced water access.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We procure a lot of our vegetables from North America and that's why we're expecting a hike of four to six per cent with vegetables,” he explained.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Charlebois, who specializes in food distribution and policy, said he believes a new normal has taken root.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The new normal is all about fluctuating prices. At any given time, you can actually see price hikes become an issue, and every year there's always a surprise,” he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Charlebois pointed out that in 2014, a spike in meat prices “spooked” consumers, something he believes led many to consider veganism as they searched for alternative, cheaper protein sources.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of course there was also the cauliflower crisis[https://www.thestar.com/news/canada/2016/01/17/soaring-cauliflower-prices-come-to-a-head-for-restaurateurs.html] of 2015/2016.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I think (our report) should be known as Canada's report on the future of food, because it's all about what's coming up,” Charlebois said. “We always try to provide Canadians with a future view of what's going to be happening from a policy perspective and from an industry perspective.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Charlebois said while preparing the 2019 report he was happy to learn Canadians are becoming more savvy when it comes to their food shopping.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Canadian consumers generally speaking are well-served by the food industry, but things are becoming more and more volatile and you have to shop around a bit more,” he said. “We presented some new data on shopping habits in that report this year. People are becoming more strategic and smarter about food shopping, which is a good thing.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The report suggests based on a “healthy” food cart, a family can expect to pay $411 more on food next year when compared with 2018. That means an average annual food budget of $12,157 in 2019. That figure includes everything from groceries to eating out.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We are also expecting food inflation to go up in 2019 unfortunately, but with gas prices as they are now consumers are getting a bit of a break at the pump right now with the average family saving $1,000 a year,” Charlebois said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“It's pretty significant, so what we're expecting in 2019 is to see a transfer from the pump to the grocery store so people can spend a little bit more on food.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Looking across the country, Charlebois said the Prairie provinces and in particular Alberta will feel a bit of a crunch.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The economy is being hit right now because of oil prices and it's quite dramatic in fact and so there will be less wealth in the marketplace and so we are expecting grocers to adjust prices accordingly,” he said. “We are expecting consumers to have access to affordable prices. It doesn't necessarily mean that they'll have the means to spend because we are expecting the economy to be a little bit tougher in that region.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He predicts the Atlantic provinces will be in for “a steady as she goes sort of year” in 2019, while in Quebec and Ontario food inflation will likely follow the national average. In 2018, Ontario was the province that saw the highest increase in food prices, with a rise of 2.7 per cent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“In terms of B.C. we are expecting that economy to go well again and … we are expecting food inflation to be higher than average in B.C. overall,” he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The report also looks ahead to what it expects will be the top three food trends for 2019. Those include revisions to Canada's new food guide being published in 2019, the ongoing push towards plant-based diets, and the anticipated legalization of food-related cannabis products.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“So 2019 will be marked by the legalization of (cannabis) edibles,” he said. “There's a lot at play right, a lot of partnerships being arranged right now, especially in the beverage sector, alcoholic and non-alcoholic beverages.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Charlebois said he believes the annual report is important because Canadians deserve to know what's in store.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“It affects all Canadians every single day. It doesn't matter if you have a car or not, everyone needs to eat,” he said. “I think Canadians deserve a chance to forecast or to have better understanding of what lies ahead.”</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CALGARY—Alberta's energy minister was on the defensive Monday, fending off accusations the NDP government ignored or downplayed warnings as early as this spring about the price-differential crisis now gripping the oil industry.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Shortly after Premier Rachel Notley announced on Sunday a temporary cut in oil production of 8.7 per cent — a bid, starting in January, to reduce the price gap and increase revenue — Alberta Party Leader Stephen Mandel accused the government of sitting idly by as the differential widened.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I'm not sure why any government wouldn't have a program in place that allowed the changes and the reduction and curtailment to happen earlier rather than wait for as long as they have,” Mandel told reporters.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While opposition parties took aim at the NDP and the federal government, political observers and industry watchers say the current crisis was decades in the making. They argue successive Alberta governments are to blame for ignoring advice to pace oilsands development and encourage energy companies to upgrade and refine bitumen into higher-valued petroleum products.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In recent months, the price differential between Alberta crude, known as Western Canadian Select, and West Texas Intermediate has grown due to an oversupply of oil and lack of pipeline access. The differential is costing the Canadian economy an estimated $80 million a day, according to the province.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Energy Minister Marg McCuaig-Boyd told reporters Monday she wasn't sure when the provincial government learned about the impending differential crisis but maintained the NDP took action immediately.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I don't know the exact timeline,” McCuaig-Boyd said. “We've known that this has been an ongoing issue, this differential. Not sure of the timeline, but it's certainly not like we sat back and did nothing.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The mandatory curtailment would see the production of raw crude and bitumen slashed by 325,000 barrels a day in the New Year, with a 10,000 barrel per day exemption for smaller producers. The province expects the reduction to fall to an average cut of 95,000 barrels per day by the end of 2019.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Notley said she expected the move to reduce the price gap by $4 US per barrel and add about $1.1 billion to government coffers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At a news conference Sunday, United Conservative Party Leader Jason Kenney called it a “difficult moment for Alberta” but said the premier's announcement was needed to stem the differential. Still, the opposition leader slammed the federal government for failing to build pipelines in recent years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We never should have been in this position,” Kenney said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The differential — while impacted by many factors — is being dealt with by government curtailment because there are currently 35 million extra barrels in storage in Alberta that can't be moved out due to a lack of pipeline capacity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The government is cutting production in the hopes this number goes down. However, most political leaders agree the province needs more pipelines as an ultimate solution.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Kenney criticized Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's veto of the Northern Gateway pipeline in 2016. First proposed in the mid-2000s, the pipeline could have been operational in 2019, moving an estimated 500,000 barrels per day.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He also called out former U.S. President Barack Obama for his 2015 veto of the Keystone XL pipeline, first proposed in 2008.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">TransCanada</span>'s Energy East was another pipeline that never saw the light of day. It would have moved hundreds of thousands of barrels per day to Eastern Canada in the hopes it replaced foreign-bought oil, Kenney said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And most recently, in August, the Trans Mountain pipeline expansion was quashed by a Federal Court of Appeal because the federal government had not consulted with Indigenous groups properly and not fully considered coastal tanker traffic. The increase would have allowed around 600,000 additional barrels per day to be sent from Edmonton to Burnaby on the B.C. coast.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Kenney said that Alberta produces around four million barrels per day, with three million being shipped through pipelines and by rail. Alberta refineries use about 600,000 for domestic consumption in Western Canada, he said, leaving 400,000 extra every day to fill the growing backlog.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Both Kenney and Notley are calling for more pipelines as a solution to the differential and in the hope it boosts the energy economy. Even though the premier has said she would buy around 7,000 rail cars to ship 120,000 more barrels per day beginning in late 2019, it's not an ideal situation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“You might want to think of that next time you're held up at a rail crossing,” Notley said to activists who oppose pipelines.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But this predicament was decades in the making, says Gil McGowan, president of the Alberta Federation of Labour. McGowan points to the blueprint laid out by former premier Peter Lougheed: ensuring each approved oilsands project came with an upgrader attached.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The policies pursued and promoted by the conservative governments that followed Lougheed amounted to nothing short of gross negligence,” said McGowan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“If we had built more upgraders, if we had more refineries, we wouldn't be in the mess that we're in today because the supply glut could have been drawn down.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He took aim at the talking point often raised by Kenney and other politicians that the Energy East pipeline would replace foreign-bought oil, noting the biggest refinery in Eastern Canada, owned by <span class="companylink">Irving Oil</span>, can't refine heavy crude from Alberta.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Further, he added, “Energy East wasn't going to go to the Irving refinery; it was going to go to an export terminal owned by Irving right next door, and it could be shipped out of Canada.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Duane Bratt, a professor of political science at Mount Royal University, said Alberta has been subjected to the price differential for decades, once referred to as the bitumen bubble by former premier Alison Redford.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While the NDP strongly advocated for additional upgraders and refineries when it was in opposition, that talk waned after the party took office in 2015 and realized how much those projects cost, said Bratt.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Refineries require billions of dollars in capital, he explained, and companies, particularly those with facilities in other jurisdictions, are understandably reluctant to invest in new projects.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“People often talk about upgrading and refineries, except for those experts in the sector and people once they get into government,” Bratt said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Correction — Dec. 4, 2018: This article was edited from a previous version that incorrectly referred to the Alberta Federation of Labour as a labour union. In fact, it is a federation of labour unions.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 1970, a group of five men and women led the charge to create a members-only space where the city's gay community could gather. They painted the walls red and yellow like a circus tent to match the name — Club Carousel — and successfully thwarted police attempts to shut it down.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Today, there's no outside trace of the building's historical significance. Club Carousel moved from its original 1207 1st St. S.W. location in 1972 before closing entirely in 1978. But Kevin Allen, who has been researching Calgary's LGBTQ history since 2012, says pieces of the community space are still there.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The owners have let me go down to the basement, and one of the walls — I'm going to have goosebumps telling you this — is still painted. It's almost 50 years old,” he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I'm desperate to preserve it. That's amazing ... It's kind of the dawn of the organized gay community in Calgary.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Allen is currently the Calgary Public Library's historian in residence, and his new book Our Past Matters: Stories of Gay Calgary is the culmination of a years-long deep dive into the people and places that formed the foundation of the city's LGBTQ community. He hopes his work will shield these oft-forgotten stories from the passage of time.</p>

Edmonton Queer History App aims to fill gap left by textbooks[https://www.thestar.com/edmonton/2018/06/08/edmonton-queer-history-app-aims-to-fill-gap-left-by-textbooks.html]
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">His book highlights key people and moments, from Treaty 7 negotiations in 1887 to the 1998 Supreme Court case in which Delwin Vriend successfully challenged the Alberta Human Rights Act after he was fired from an Edmonton college for being gay.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Allen says Club Carousel was one of the most essential developments in that history for Calgary — the first time the city's gay community boldly established its own space.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But it was far from the first gathering place for gay people in Calgary. In Canada, it was a criminal offence to have sex with someone of the same sex until 1969. Before that, spaces where gay people could meet were known only in whispers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Allen uncovered one of those places by accident, when a conversation with his parents about where gay people used to hang out in Calgary revealed a rumour about the Kings Arms Tavern at the Palliser Hotel.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“(My dad), as a straight man, just somehow knew that if you don't want to be potentially thought of as gay, he knew not to drink there,” Allen says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Like Club Carousel, there's now almost no sign of that important landmark for the city's LGBTQ history. It's been replaced by a <span class="companylink">Starbucks</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since then, Allen says, learning about the city's LGBTQ history has taken over his life. He quit his arts administration job in 2014 to devote more time to it, launching a Kickstarter that led to the book.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I'll probably be engaged with queer history for the rest of my life,” he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other important pieces of the past include activism by the Of Colour Collective, which challenged white dominance in queer spaces during the '90s, as well as the founding of the first gender clinic at Calgary's Foothills Hospital, where transgender people could access care.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A Calgary bus driver was at the centre of the case that decriminalized homosexuality in Canada, but before Allen began researching the book, he'd never heard his name.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Everett Klippert is recognized as the last person in Canada to go to prison just for being gay, but “his story had completely disappeared,” Allen says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Our history was not well recorded by institutions,” he says. “Before the '50s, there's almost no first-person accounts.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Allen continues to interview LGBTQ people in their 70s, 80s and 90s to ensure their stories aren't lost.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Calgary's history narrative is dominated by the Stampede, by energy and oil exploration, kind of the mavericks,” he says. “And those are all important stories, but there's a lot of other stories and a lot of other histories in Calgary.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Allen wants to make sure people know about Calgary's connections to important moments for LGBTQ rights in Canada and he wants to ensure stories about the people and places that built the city's community are preserved — in more than half-remembered rumours.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He remembers going out dancing during the '90s at the former Club Carousel location — long since closed but turned into a different bar, one of several along 1st St. S.W.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Who knew that downstairs was this ...” he says, pausing. “Although it had a whiff of something gay about it. Twenty years later, people would say, 'Isn't that a gay bar?'”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He wonders how that knowledge might have “permeated the walls,” pausing to think again.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Probably the same way my dad knew about the Palliser. I've never made that connection.”</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Alberta’s move to force cuts to oil production in the province is clouding an already modest outlook for Canadian economic growth in 2019.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Several of Canada’s big banks – <span class="companylink">Bank of Montreal</span>, <span class="companylink">Toronto-Dominion Bank</span> and <span class="companylink">National Bank of Canada</span> – issued research notes Monday, all saying that the planned production cuts, announced by Alberta Premier Rachel Notley on Sunday, will take a bite out of the country’s overall economic output next year.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The economists predicted the cuts would shave about 0.2 percentage points off 2019 real gross domestic product growth, which had been forecast at about 2 per cent. However, they said the production cuts will be felt much harder in the first quarter of the year, when they first come into force – and they will have a much harsher effect on Alberta’s economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“It will put a serious dent in the GDP forecast to start 2019,” wrote Bank of Montreal economists Benjamin Reitzes and Robert Kavcic. The bank slashed its projected first-quarter growth rate to a thin 0.7 per cent annualized, from 2 per cent previously.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">Bank of Montreal</span> also cut its Alberta 2019 GDP growth forecast in half, from 2.4 per cent to 1.2 per cent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We had already assumed that [oil and gas sector] capital spending budgets would be scaled back next year given the weak price environment, but the production cut adds a new layer of downside,” Mr. Reitzes and Mr. Kavcic said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Sunday, Ms. Notley announced her government would impose temporary cuts of 325,000 barrels a day, or 8.7 per cent of the province’s oil output, to help alleviate a supply glut that has built up in the province owing to severe transportation backlogs. The oversupplies have resulted in severely depressed prices for Alberta crude, which has been trading at deep discounts to benchmark U.S. prices, and has prompted growing public outcry for governments to take action.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">TD Bank economists Brian DePratto and Omar Abdelrahman predicted that Alberta’s growth could be “between 0.6 percentage point and 1.3 percentage points lower than previously anticipated” as a result of the production slowdown. The bank had been projecting 2.4-per-cent growth for the province next year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“All negative impacts will be heavily front-loaded in the year,” they said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">However, economists said the drag on growth will ease as the year progresses. The Alberta government plans to reduce the size of the cutback significantly after three months, and plans to remove the production restrictions entirely at the end of next year. Meanwhile, additional shipping capacity should help reduce excess oil inventories.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The Alberta government anticipates having an additional 120,000 barrels per day of rail export capacity through its purchases of rail cars and related facilities by [2019 year end]. As well, takeaway capacity should be improved via Enbridge’s revamped Line 3 pipeline,” the TD economists said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">National Bank senior economist Krishen Rangasamy, who cut his 2019 GDP growth projection from 2 per cent to 1.8 per cent, noted that the oil cuts aren’t the only factor weighing on the forecast.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The outlook for next year … has become darker amidst the loss of momentum for the global economy and the resulting decline in commodity prices,” he wrote. He added that a weaker-than-expected savings rate among Canadian consumers, revealed in last week’s third-quarter GDP report, means that consumer spending “is also more vulnerable than first thought.”</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Shares in the companies most likely to benefit from the move to curtail crude production starting Jan. 1 soared Monday as oil price differentials plunged.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, shares in oil producers that had been either benefiting or were insulated from the discount prices were little changed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There are going to be a number of producers who will shoulder the brunt of the Alberta government's 325,000 barrels per day in mandated production curtailments of raw crude and bitumen (namely the oilsands producers)," Calgary-based <span class="companylink">AltaCorp Capital</span> said in a report.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"But the broader health of the province is likely to benefit over the medium term from the decision as a result of narrowing differentials and stronger royalty revenue."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Alberta Premier Rachel Notley announced Sunday the province will require companies producing more than 10,000 barrels per day of oil to cut back by about 8.7 per cent (a total of 325,000 bpd) until there is enough shipping space on pipelines to improve prices, expected to take about three months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After that, the reduction will be lowered to 95,000 bpd through the rest of 2019.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of the 378 operators with active oil production in Alberta in October, only 25 produce more than 10,000 bpd, AltaCorp noted.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the end of trading on Monday, <span class="companylink">Cenovus Energy Inc</span>. shares were trading at $10.99, almost 12 per cent higher than their Friday close, while <span class="companylink">Canadian Natural Resources Ltd</span>. closed at $36.58, up 9.55 per cent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Sunday, both Cenovus and Canadian Natural issued statements of support for the Alberta move, as did Chinese-owned oilsands producer CNOOC-Nexen.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I think any time that government has to step in to fix a market, it's never a time for celebration," Cenovus CEO Alex Pourbaix said in an interview Monday, adding he's more "relieved" than pleased with Alberta's decision to go along with his call for the cuts last month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Calgary's major integrated companies — those that both produce and refine oil — including <span class="companylink">Suncor Energy Inc</span>., <span class="companylink">Imperial Oil Ltd</span>. and <span class="companylink">Husky Energy Inc</span>., said in statements they remain opposed to the cuts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Suncor closed at $42.93, nine cents higher, while Imperial ended the day at $38.09, off 1.5 per cent, and Husky shares were at $16.87, a gain of 2.2 per cent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Imperial CEO Rich Kruger warned of the danger of "unintended consequences" of the production cuts, including to competitiveness and trade.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Husky also mentioned possible "serious negative investment, economic and trade consequences."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Cenovus consulted experts on the trade issue and believes the cuts are allowed, Pourbaix said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"This is not targeted at a country," he said. "Every pipeline going to the U.S. was full before this decision and every pipeline will remain full after this decision."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The discount between Western Canadian Select bitumen-blend oil and New York-traded West Texas Intermediate varied between US$19.75 per barrel and US$22.25 on Monday, an improvement over Friday's US$28.50 settlement price, according to Net Energy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Discounts for upgraded synthetic oil improved to US$13.50 per barrel Monday afternoon from US$18.50 on Friday and Edmonton-priced light oil differentials fell to US$15.25 from US$23.00.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In its report, AltaCorp said winners from the curtailments will include the provincial government (which estimates it will earn $1.1 billion more from royalties in the 2019-20 fiscal year); energy producers in B.C. and Saskatchewan, that will benefit from better prices without having to cut production; condensate producers, as that light oil isn't included in the curtailment; and junior energy producers who are exempt from the program.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The losers include integrated producers who will likely pay more for their refining feedstock and companies that had intended to grow their production in the first half of 2019, it said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Oilfield service companies are also on the losing side of the equation, GMP FirstEnergy said in a note, because drilling budgets will likely shrink in early 2019.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Companies that previously reduced output voluntarily will receive credit under the Alberta plan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Analysts said that means the market is already halfway to the provincial goal, estimating that between 130,000 and 160,000 bpd has already been shut in, mainly by Cenovus and Canadian Natural.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pourbaix said Cenovus estimates voluntary curtailment are higher, at about 200,000 bpd, including more than 40,000 bpd from Cenovus alone.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Canadian heavy-oil prices and shares in Canadian crude producers jumped in early trading[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/business/article-canadas-crude-producers-see-shares-jump-on-alberta-production-cuts/] , one day after the Alberta government announced it would impose a production cut of 325,000 barrels a day to reduce a supply glut that has driven prices down. (for subscribers) The plan to decrease production by 8.7 per cent next year has Premier Rachel Notley at odds[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/business/article-alberta-premier-notley-to-address-province-on-industry-wide-limits-on/] with some big industry players on how to fix the crisis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“It’s clear the Premier did not go into production quotas lightly,” Jeffrey Jones writes[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/business/commentary/article-albertas-hostage-to-the-oil-market-not-in-control-of-one/] (for subscribers), “and, by all accounts, her consultations with senior finance and industry professionals in the lead-up showed her solid grasp of the gravity of the situation. ... Any disagreement in the producer ranks has to be treated as a necessary evil.”</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In less time than a commercial jet would take to fly from Vancouver to St. John’s, Canadian astronaut David Saint-Jacques reached[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/business/technology/science/article-the-soyuz-launch-live-watch-david-saint-jacques-set-off-for-the/] the International Space Station today. Mission controllers report that the Soyuz capsule that carried him, together with Russian cosmonaut Oleg Kononenko and U.S. astronaut Anne McClain, into orbit today began docking with the facility at 12:33 p.m. (ET), about six hours after blastoff from Kazakhstan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Saint-Jacques was just 14 when Marc Garneau became the first Canadian to fly in space, and he was still an undergraduate when Chris Hadfield and Julie Payette were among those picked in Canada’s second astronaut call. Sixteen years later, he was working as a Northern doctor when the next call came up. It was then that he heard a five-year-old’s voice inside saying, “Please try. At least try. You’ve got to give it a shot.” Read more about Canada’s latest astronaut here[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/canada/article-for-david-saint-jacques-launching-into-space-is-a-dream-come-true/] .</p>

The moves come as Statscan is being investigated by the federal Privacy Commissioner[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/politics/article-chief-statistician-defends-effort-to-obtain-canadian-banking-records/] after concerns were raised over its plans to obtain an unprecedented level of access to the personal financial information of Canadians.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Maria Ressa, one of the most celebrated journalists in the Philippines, surrendered to a Manila court and posted bail today, as she attempts to fight tax charges she called an attempt to silence a critical media voice, Nathan VanderKlippe writes[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/world/article-celebrated-journalist-vows-to-fight-tax-charges-seen-as-harassment-of/] . In a statement, she called five tax-related charges against the company she founded, Rappler Holdings, “politically motivated.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Founded in 2012, Rappler has become a standard-bearer for the independent press in the Philippines, and Ms. Ressa is its award-winning executive editor. But international accolades have done little to ease pressure on her at home, where she is fighting to maintain a news organization that has challenged the often deadly exercise of power under President Rodrigo Duterte.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Knowing who owns a property or a company is the missing link between the crime of laundering money and the illegal activities where that cash is generated, ranging from tax evasion to terrorism and drug smuggling. The ability of people to hide behind proxies and numbered companies – as they can now do in Canada – is the main obstacle to rooting out money laundering.” - Barrie McKenna[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/business/commentary/article-failed-bc-money-laundering-case-shows-snow-washing-is-thriving-in/]

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The tension in boxing exists somewhere in the middle. However much we talk about the science and its sweetness – and there is plenty of that – it is the brutality of fist-fighting that fascinates viewers. It’s the idea that people are putting not just their pride or livelihoods at real risk, but also their existence. On some occasions, that will result in glory. In others, inevitably, tragedy.” -  Cathal Kelly [https://www.theglobeandmail.com/sports/article-the-scary-knockout-of-adonis-stevenson-is-a-reminder-of-the-sweet/]

Of course, access matters – but the ultimate policy objective should be better health outcomes, both individually and collectively. We should strive for a pharmacare program that ensures timely, equitable and consistent access to prescription drugs, appropriateness of therapy, and affordability – for patients, providers and taxpayers.” -  André Picard [https://www.theglobeandmail.com/opinion/article-the-hard-sell-on-pharmacare/]

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Studying the potential link between dementia and domestic violence</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In private conversations, Donald Weaver’s dementia patients and their family members often open up about the violence they face at home, Wency Leung writes[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/life/health-and-fitness/article-studying-the-potential-link-between-dementia-and-domestic-violence/] .</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The stories are numerous, yet similar – patients wonder whether their dementia is the result of head injuries inflicted years earlier by an abusive spouse, caregivers worry that agitated patients may act out and harm others and family members voice concerns that overburdened primary caregivers might unleash their frustrations on patients.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As a researcher, University of Toronto professor and practising neurologist, Weaver works in his clinic only one day a week. But even in his limited practice, he encounters these kinds of stories multiple times a month. “If I didn’t ask the questions, I wouldn’t be told,” he says, explaining these cases are likely just the tip of the iceberg.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">'Boring and normal’: The new frontier of polyamorous parenting</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sometimes Stephanie Weisner doesn’t know how two-parent families do it all, without a Mike in tow, Zosia Bielski writes[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/canada/article-boring-and-normal-the-new-frontier-of-polyamorous-parenting/] . Ms. Weisner, 38, has been in a polyamorous relationship with her husband, Ian Hubbard, and her work colleague, Mike Wissink, for eight years. The three adults all live together in one home in Moncton, alongside Ms. Weisner and Mr. Hubbard’s two children, who are seven and nine years old.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The family keeps a joint e-mail account to sort out their household logistics. While Ms. Weisner and Mr. Wissink, 49, work shifts at their airline industry jobs, Mr. Hubbard, 47, home-schools the children. Mr. Wissink often cooks and cleans while Ms. Weisner does the groceries. All three pitch in with bedtimes and shuttling the kids to their various activities. This winter, the whole family’s going to Disney World.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More Canadians than ever before are pursuing non-monogamy, according to a new book, Polyamorous: Living and Loving More, by Toronto journalist Jenny Yuen. Interviewing scores of poly Canadians, Yuen examines how those stepping away from the monogamous nuclear family hope to dispel misconceptions and be normalized in their communities. As more polyamorous parents come out, they are challenging society to redefine what makes a family – just as LGBTQ parents did before them, and divorced and single parents did years earlier. Many are calling for stronger legal rights, from guardianship to child support to family health insurance.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CALGARY, Alberta, Dec. 03, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- <span class="companylink">Trican Well Service Ltd</span>. (“Trican” or the “Company”) today announced the pricing of an underwritten secondary offering of common shares (“Keane Shares”) of <span class="companylink">Keane Group Inc</span>. (“Keane Group”) by one of its stockholders, Keane Investor Holdings, LLC (the “Selling Stockholder”), of 5,251,249 Keane Shares.</p>

Following such distribution, Trican will cease to hold an equity interest in the Selling Stockholder. Although Trican believes the Keane Group will continue its strong financial and operational performance, the Company feels liquidity of its investment is prudent at this time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Trican continues to believe its strategy of maintaining a strong balance sheet in a volatile Canadian oilfield environment is important to the long-term success of the Company, but also believes volatility can provide an opportunity to generate long-term returns for its shareholders. The secondary offering will further strengthen Trican’s financial position and provide additional capital for purchases of the Company’s shares. Trican remains committed to investing in our business and since October 3, 2018 Trican has purchased approximately 10 million shares or 33% of the amount allowed under the current Normal Course Issuer Bid (“NCIB”) and is able to repurchase approximately 20 million additional shares under the current NCIB program.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Oil prices also rose on continued expectation that <span class="companylink">OPEC</span> on Thursday will cut production by up to 1.5 million barrels a day to support prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I think those two factors combined are providing a little bit of lift for oil prices," said Craig Fehr, Canadian markets strategist for Edward Jones.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A weekend 90-day ceasefire between the U.S. and China on imposing higher tariffs was a catalyst for global markets to rise even though a final resolution is far from certain, Fehr said in an interview.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It is far too early to sound the all-clear signal when it comes to the trade tension that exists between the U.S. and China," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"That's an encouraging signal that both sides are willing to come to the table but this is far from a concrete agreement that provides a road map for what trade looks like going forward. It's premature to suggest that equity markets can unshackle themselves from the trade worries at this point."</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many women inspired me this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some are women I am lucky to know and love personally, from family elders in their nineties, remarkably still functioning near the top of their game, to friends who survived deep personal tragedy or serious setbacks with strength and grace.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some are high profile Canadian politicians who calmly continue to navigate fraught political roles.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Two of them made headlines this past weekend.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Chrystia Freeland, Canada's Minister of Foreign Affairs, was in Buenos Aires for the signing[https://www.thestar.com/business/opinion/2018/12/03/trade-deal-signing-seems-strictly-ceremonial.html] of the new Canada-U.S.-Mexico trade pact, the changing acronym [https://www.thestar.com/news/world/2018/11/30/usmca-cusma-what-the-new-nafta-is-called-depends-on-whos-talking.html]of which continues to elude me.(Can't they even make that easy for us?)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As the minister responsible for overseeing the negotiations for Nafta's replacement deal, the Liberal MP for Toronto's University-Rosedale riding notably kept her cool throughout one of the most lengthy, difficult and unpredictable trade negotiations in Canadian history, even when she and Prime Minister Justin Trudeau were petulantly insulted by President Donald Trump.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Freeland also spoke out against Saudi Arabia for human rights violations well before the Kashoggi murder.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Preternaturally calm, articulate, and poised, Freeland's demeanour suggests she takes her job very seriously but she's not full of herself. A rarity in political life. She even dropped off popsicles for the media on a sweltering summer day in Washington DC.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And a speech she delivered last June was a thoughtful rebuke of everything Donald Trump stands for. “Facts matter. Truth matters. Competence and honesty, among elected leaders and in our public service, matter.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Rachel Notley, NDP Premier of Alberta, delivered a tough statement [https://www.thestar.com/business/2018/12/03/alberta-orders-87-per-cent-oil-production-cut-to-help-deal-with-low-prices.html]Sunday announcing she was temporarily reducing the crude oil production in her province to hopefully sell the glut of oil the province has and raise prices that are too low.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What impresses me is her public calm, and her attempt to fight for both progressive values and the economic well-being of her province in today's crucible of climate change and anti-pipeline politics. This can often leave her lonely among out of province progressives who never want to hear the word pipeline again.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The images from this past year of Notley dancing joyfully at a Pride parade or singing a country and western song seem far removed from today's extreme political tensions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Whether her government survives the ferocious onslaught of Jason Kenney, leader of the United Conservative Party in next spring's provincial election, Notley will have shown she is an authentic leader, loyal to her province, who doesn't back down from a fight.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Freeland and Notley of course know the risks and responsibilities that come from assuming public office.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But what about women who for the first time spoke out about a personally painful issues and changed the debate?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Two startlingly different voices moved me.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There was Emma Gonzalez[https://www.thestar.com/news/world/2018/02/18/students-push-for-stricter-gun-laws-after-school-shooting-plan-washington-and-tallahassee-marches.html], the Parkland, Florida high school student who, at 18, stepped to the mic last February at a rally three bleak short days after a mass shooting at her school killed 17 students and staff and gave the world the memorable words: “We call BS.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With those words Gonzalez eloquently condemned both the <span class="companylink">National Rifle Association</span> and the politicians who accept large donations from the pro-gun group and are in their pocket.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With her shaved head and natural charisma Gonzalez, remained a compelling figure as she helped co-found a new gun control advocacy group that has started to make inroads in both funding and political support.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She became one of the most visible symbols of the growing wave of disgust that many Americans feel that their leaders can't find a way to enact gun laws and at least try to prevent the country's staggering number of mass shootings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Finally Christine Blasey Ford. Many women who watched her testimony [https://www.thestar.com/news/world/2018/09/27/high-drama-in-senate-as-kavanaugh-ford-hearing-nears.html]last September will just recall the visceral pain—hers and ours- as she told a familiar story of sexual assault.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But they should not forget the risks she took, the abuse she endured publicly—so many death threats she still has not been able to move back into her home. And the moral and emotional stamina the California professor of psychology had to summon as she came forward under enormous pressure to do what she called her “civic duty” and testify to a <span class="companylink">Senate judiciary committee</span> hearing last fall that Brett Kavanaugh, Trump's Supreme Court nominee, had sexually assaulted her when they were both teenagers in the early 1980's.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Describing what she remembered of the incident, in which she said Kavanaugh and a friend detained her in a room and pinned her down on a bed, Blasey Ford also offered precise clinical language about the chemistry of the brain, the by-product of a well-regarded career: “Indelible in the hippocampus is the laughter,” she said softly as she recounted the “uproarious laughter” of two entitled young men who were “having fun at my expense.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We all know what happened next. Kavanaugh, in a bitter and angry tirade before the committee, held onto enough support to eventually survive the scandal—although there were other accusations of sexual misconduct and of lying.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He is now not only sitting on the Supreme Court and receiving standing ovations when he speaks, but also according to the <span class="companylink">Washington Post</span>, back coaching his daughter's basketball team, something he said through tears during the hearing he would probably, if the accusations were allowed to stand, never be allowed to do again.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile Blasey Ford, still receiving death threats, has not been able to fully resume her normal life. I won't forget her. I like to think she will remain indelible in my hippocampus.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now, who inspired you this year?</p>

</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CALGARY, Alberta, Dec. 03, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- (TSX: BDI) <span class="companylink">Black Diamond Group Limited</span> (“Black Diamond” or the “Company”), a leading provider of modular space solutions and workforce accommodations, today provided its 2019 capital spending plan.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Management’s focus on operating cash flows and improved balance sheet leverage in 2018 has positioned the Company to return to disciplined organic growth. Management plans to invest approximately $35 million in capital expenditures in 2019, on a gross basis and allocated throughout the year. This plan is expected to be funded entirely through operating cash flows with residual cash from business operations applied to further reducing debt. The 2019 capital plan includes maintenance capital, which is expected to be nominal and generally in line with 2018 levels.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The majority of the 2019 capital plan will be allocated to the Company’s diversified Modular Space Solutions (“MSS”) business, which continues to generate opportunities to achieve attractive returns on investment in a number of markets and industries throughout North America. Management expects 2019 gross capital spending in MSS to be approximately $25 to $30 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Within the <span class="companylink">Workforce Solutions</span> (“WFS”) business unit, our markets in Australia and the United States are seeing continued strength and Management anticipates spending approximately $5 to $10 million within these regions where customer contracts and utilization support the need for fleet growth. Also included is some modest capital for incremental software development of the LodgeLink platform.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Similar to previous years, the Company expects to sell some existing fleet assets through the normal course of business and to rebalance certain asset categories within the WFS division. Over the last several years, the Company has realized proceeds in the range of $10 to $15 million on an annual basis and expects this general trend to continue in 2019.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite the current headwinds within the Canadian energy industry, Black Diamond remains optimistic heading into 2019. Project-related work within our WFS segment is expected to move forward, and the Company continues to execute on its longer-term strategy of growing its MSS division, with a minimum net fleet growth of 10% per year. This growth is expected to drive continued improvement in scale and profitability leading to further stability and diversification of the Company.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">EDMONTON — The Alberta government has ordered a mandatory cut to crude oil production next year to deal with historically low prices being paid for Canadian oil. Here are six things to know about Canada's resource:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Light or heavy: Each type of oil around the world has its own price. New-York-traded West Texas Intermediate (WTI), delivered at Cushing, Okla., is the benchmark price for light crude oil in North America. Western Canadian Select (WCS) is the reference price for heavy crude oil from the oilsands delivered at Hardisty, Alta.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Price differential: Canada's heavy crude usually trades at a discount because of refining and transportation costs, so a price gap or differential is typical between WTI and WCS.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Record gap: The differential is usually between US$10 to US$15 per barrel. The biggest gap — US$52 per barrel — was recorded in October. Experts say the extreme discount happened due to a reliance on high-cost transportation — rail and truck — instead of new pipelines.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The glut: Alberta says about 190,000 barrels of raw crude oil and bitumen are being produced each day that can't be shipped out. Roughly 35 million barrels, about twice the normal level, are in storage.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Cutting production: The province has ordered the output of raw crude oil and bitumen to be reduced by 8.7 per cent, or 325,000 barrels per day, starting in January. As the excess storage clears, the reduction is expected to drop to 95,000 barrels a day until the end of next December. The move is expected to narrow the differential by at least $4 per barrel.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Winners and losers: Calgary economist Trevor Tombe says $4 per barrel doesn't sound like much but, over a year, it's worth about $1 billion to the Alberta government's budget. While some companies will also benefit, those with their own refining and upgrading operations may not.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Toronto Stock Exchange’s S&P/TSX composite index was up 176.59 points, or 1.16 per cent, at 15,374.41.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Energy stocks jumped over 4.5 per cent in early trading. <span class="companylink">Canadian Natural Resources Ltd</span>. was up 9.7 per cent, while <span class="companylink">Cenovus Energy Inc</span>. rose 9.5 per cent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In New York, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 241.11 points, or 0.94 per cent, at the open to 25,779.57.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The S&P 500 opened higher by 30.33 points, or 1.10 per cent, at 2,790.50. The Nasdaq Composite gained 155.59 points, or 2.12 per cent, to 7,486.13 at the opening bell.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Oil prices jumped by more than 5 per cent on Monday after the United States and China agreed a 90-day truce in a trade dispute, Alberta ordered a production cut, and as exporter group <span class="companylink">OPEC</span> looked set to reduce supply.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. light crude oil rose $2.92 a barrel to a high of $53.85, up 5.7 per cent, before easing to around $53.25. Brent crude rose 5.3 per cent or $3.14 to a high of $62.60 and was last trading around $62.00, up $2.54.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“From Argentina to Alberta, the oil market news is about supply curtailments,” said Norbert Rucker, head of commodity research at Swiss bank <span class="companylink">Julius Baer</span>. “A brightening market mood will likely extend today’s price rally in the very near term.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">China and the United States agreed during a weekend meeting in Argentina of the <span class="companylink">Group of 20</span> leading economies not to impose additional trade tariffs for at least 90 days while they hold talks to resolve existing disputes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The trade war between the world’s two biggest economies has weighed heavily on global trade, sparking concerns of an economic slowdown.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Crude oil has not been included in the list of products facing import tariffs, but traders said the positive sentiment of the truce was also driving crude markets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Oil also received support from an announcement by Alberta that it would force producers to cut output by 8.7 per cent, or 325,000 barrels per day (bpd), to deal with a pipeline bottleneck that has led to crude building up in storage.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">European benchmarks rallied almost across the board. Germany’s DAX - the most sensitive to China and trade war fears - led the way with a 2.5-per-cent rise to its highest since Nov. 14.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. President Donald Trump also said “China has agreed to reduce and remove tariffs on cars coming into China from the U.S. Currently the tariff is 40 per cent”. That helped boost European autos more than 4 per cent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The trade truce was the latest “circuit breaker” needed to trigger a return to risk appetite, said Guillermo Felices, head of research and strategy in the Multi-Asset, Quantitative and Solutions team at <span class="companylink">BNP Paribas Asset Management</span>,</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The first was markets pricing in a more dovish Fed, the second, more aggressive policy stimulus by the Chinese authorities and the third, easing trade tensions,” he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Felices cautioned, however, that negotiations had reached a “ceasefire” rather than lasting peace.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“China can deliver on the easy things like buying more agriculture as they need those goods, but when you go into the territory of intellectual property, and industrial and technology policy, you are clashing with China’s long-term aims,” he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MSCI’s all-country world index climbed 0.8 per cent in its sixth straight day of gains and hit its highest since Nov. 9. Emerging-market equities rose two percent and were set for their strongest day in a month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Asian shares kicked off the rally, with Chinese markets rising more than 2.5 per cent and Japan’s Nikkei soaring to six-week highs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The risk-on mood saw MSCI’s index of emerging-market currencies rise 0.7 per cent, led by China’s yuan, which saw its biggest daily gain since February 2016 .</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">However, the U.S. dollar started to recover after slumping as much as half a percent earlier against a basket of currencies . It was just 0.2 per cent lower, knocking the euro off the day’s highs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sterling, meanwhile, dropped as Brexit nerves returned. Against the dollar, the pound fell to its lowest since October at $1.2708, down nearly 0.7 per cent from the day’s highs. Against the euro, it slipped 0.3 per cent to 89.05 pence.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Until the British parliament votes on the deal next week, we are going to see a steady drumbeat of Brexit headlines, which is going to keep the pound weak,” <span class="companylink">Danske Bank</span> strategist Morten Helt said, referring to a Dec. 11 lawmakers’ vote on Prime Minister Theresa May’s agreement on leaving the <span class="companylink">European Union</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">However, the dollar has already come under some pressure from a recent shift by the <span class="companylink">U.S. Federal Reserve</span> to a slightly more dovish stance. Comments by Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell were interpreted by markets as hinting at a slower pace of rate increases.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Powell was scheduled to testify later this week to a congressional Joint Economic Committee.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The latest market rally would not bring a return to a more hawkish Fed stance, Berenberg economist Florian Hense said. “We would need to see some rebound in economic activity to lift expectations of more rate hikes,” Hense said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">U.S. Treasury</span> yields pulled back from Friday’s over-two-month lows. Ten-year yields traded around 3.03 per cent .</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Germany’s 10-year government bond, the benchmark for the euro area, initially rose four basis points to 0.347 per cent , but eased back to 0.32 per cent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yields on riskier southern European bonds were down across the board, though Italian bonds trimmed some gains after the <span class="companylink">European Central Bank</span> revealed Italy’s share of <span class="companylink">ECB</span> capital would be cut slightly.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ten-year yields stayed close to two-month lows, however .</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A tanker truck in the Lloydminster region on the Alberta-Saskatchewan border gets loaded up. Its destination is some eight hours to the southeast. The cargo is unusual: 200 barrels of heavy oil.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It’s not a cheap operation. Trucking the oil costs about $16 a barrel. But in Estevan, in southeast Saskatchewan, <span class="companylink">Gear Energy Ltd</span>. blends the heavy oil with some of its light oil from the area and puts it on a pipeline. The elaborate contortion to move oil nets the company a profit instead of losing money on the depressed price of heavy crude. Gear is sending a truck down the highway every second day.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Ingram Gillmore, Gear’s chief executive, can hardly believe it has come to this. “It’s not a lot of oil, because it’s an eight-hour drive, and that costs a lot,” Mr. Gillmore said. Trucking oil across Saskatchewan, he said, is “ridiculous.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Gillmore started <span class="companylink">Gear Energy Ltd</span>. eight years ago. The idea was to make money on an unloved commodity: Alberta heavy oil.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Gear rode the last boom, early in this decade, then toiled through the bust after 2014. It was hard, but the company never once booked negative cash flow. Today, with the province’s oil prices near record lows, Mr. Gillmore is facing red ink in November and December.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For Gear, business is the worst it’s ever been. Mr. Gillmore has taken an array of emergency measures. He shut down two rigs drilling new wells in early October. He put some 40,000 barrels of oil into storage tanks instead of selling them. He killed plans to add staff at head office. And he turned off the power to engines at some sites drawing the viscous oil from underground. Gear’s oil production should be upward of 10,000 barrels a day. Instead, it is about two-thirds that.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Alberta energy companies are resorting to extreme measures to survive a crippling industry downturn. Oil prices in Western Canada have collapsed owing to a shortage of pipeline capacity. The resulting oversupply has nowhere to go. Oil companies are shutting in or reducing production, storing existing supplies in the hopes of better prices in the future, and increasingly turning to railways and even trucks to move oil, even though transportation costs – and risks – are higher. Some companies are shifting work to the booming U.S. oil industry.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The price of Western Canadian Select – a heavy oil benchmark in Alberta – traded less than US$20 most of this week, compared with the U.S. benchmark of more than US$50 and even higher abroad. The low price is expected to persist for months and could generate sizeable losses for many producers. And because oil companies already slashed costs during the downturn a few years ago, there isn’t much left to cut this time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Alberta psyche is rattled these days – and its fragile nature has fostered an embattled mentality. Albertans feel alone in their struggle, sensing that the rest of the country doesn’t understand or care.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2015, when the most recent price bust took hold, the province remained confident – it had lived through such downturns before. In 2016, when unemployment hit 9 per cent – a level not seen since the early 1990s – that confidence waned as the pain spread. But over the past couple of years, it looked like things were getting better, even with challenges. Alberta’s unemployment rate was down to 6.2 per cent this spring.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now, however, this latest blow feels like the hardest one. Unemployment climbed back to 7.3 per cent in September – while the national rate was at its lowest in decades. House prices throughout the oil patch are down over the past three years, a period during which the rest of Canada saw home prices boom.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The oil-price collapse has opened a rift in the industry and put politicians under pressure to find quick solutions. Several major Alberta oil producers are urging the provincial government to institute mandated production cuts as a way to boost prices; others resist the idea. Premier Rachel Notley is set to decide on the issue soon.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, Alberta is being held "hostage” by the lack of progress on new pipelines – and the situation is “fiscal and economic insanity,” Ms. Notley said in a speech in Ottawa on Wednesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Her words are echoed across the oil patch. There is a deep anger in downtown Calgary these days.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Gillmore, as with many in Alberta, hopes the crisis will force other Canadians to appreciate the seriousness of the province’s plight.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I hate to say this, but it’s almost good that pricing is so insanely terrible, because I hope it comes to the attention of people east of Manitoba,” Mr. Gillmore said in an interview at his office in downtown Calgary, where the equivalent of one out of four buildings is completely empty.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“All the anti-oil rhetoric, which is mostly fictitious, is suddenly going to become a lot less meaningful to people when they realize the Canadian economy is suffering. I hope that this is so bad that the rest of Canada wants to elect people who are going to support the energy industry.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">‘Some pretty drastic moves’</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">Whitecap Resources Inc</span>. had never shut in a barrel of oil production until late November. The company, launched in the depths of the 2009 global financial crisis, should have an advantage because it produces higher-priced light oil. But these days, Alberta oil of all types is facing transportation bottlenecks. Whitecap pored over operational data and identified areas where production no longer made sense financially. The company cut power to some pump jacks in the field and shut down about 500 barrels a day of production.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is also resorting to trucks to get oil moving. In October, it launched a convoy of rigs to get its light oil down the road to a rare opening in a pipeline. The company is moving roughly 7,500 barrels a day – a fleet of some 30 trucks, each carrying about 250 barrels of oil.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Now you’ve got diesel trucks running down the highway,” CEO Grant Fagerheim said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The company’s capital budget is $450-million this year, and in early November, Mr. Fagerheim was figuring a ballpark of $600-million for 2019. Now, he doesn’t know. Whitecap had planned to tell its investors on Dec. 5 about its plans but this week abruptly delayed that “until further notice.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“There’s some pretty drastic moves being made,” Mr. Fagerheim said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He sketched a map and arrows on a piece of paper to show the current, unusual dynamics of the global oil industry.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Alberta is selling its oil to the United States at a huge discount. At the same time, Eastern Canada is buying 350,000 barrels a day of U.S. oil at full price, with additional expensive oil coming from places such as Algeria and Saudi Arabia.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It’s a situation that could have been helped by the proposed Energy East pipeline to the East Coast, but that plan was scrapped amid widespread opposition.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Fagerheim has little faith in Canada’s political leaders. He’s not impressed that Ottawa spent billions this year to buy the Trans Mountain pipeline and a proposed expansion project in a bid to get the project completed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Do they really want to drive pipelines,” he said, “or did they buy this to have it go away?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">‘The market is broken’</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the summer, <span class="companylink">Cenovus Energy Inc</span>. produced 377,000 barrels a day from the oil sands. But as with many Alberta oil producers, Cenovus is hitting the brakes. At current prices, it is losing US$5 a barrel.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the meantime, Cenovus made a deal in September to lease new rail cars, similar to a plan the province is working on for the industry as a whole. Cenovus’s deal would move 100,000 barrels a day to the Gulf Coast in Texas, where the oil would get a much higher price. The first rail cars roll off the assembly line in April.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In this crunch, Cenovus is pushing the science of the oil sands. It has curtailed production in a delicate balance it calls “dynamic storage,” in which it continues to pump steam into its reservoirs to warm the bitumen, but does not pull the oil out of the ground. The bitumen is stored in the reservoir. The technique involves slowing what are called electrical submersible pumps. The company conducted this experiment in the spring for about six weeks, when the price differential last exploded. It figures it can keep up this art-and-science juggling act to hold back some 50,000 or so barrels a day for several months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We’re doing everything we can,” said Keith Chiasson, a Cenovus senior vice-president, early on a late November morning, the sky pitch black, ahead of meetings to decide the company’s 2019 budget. “Our bitumen is in high demand – if we can actually access the global market.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While the industry has collectively cut back as much as 200,000 barrels a day of production, Cenovus made the big call last month. It wants the provincial government to mandate all producers to cut back. It argues that oil sands rivals such as Exxon Mobil Corp.-controlled Imperial Oil – which benefit from low prices with their refining operations – are making windfall profits on the backs of Albertans and other Canadians.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The market is broken,” Mr. Chiasson said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the longer term, he has hope for the future. In addition to more oil by rail, new pipeline capacity such as <span class="companylink">Enbridge Inc</span>.’s proposed Line 3 is supposed to open by this time next year, which will ease the current squeeze.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We’re confident the pipelines will eventually get built.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">‘We’re really a dumb nation’</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At a breakfast at the Petroleum Club in late November, Mark Scholz, head of the <span class="companylink">Canadian Association of Oilwell Drilling Contractors</span>, gave a fiery speech. He talked of an industry under siege, “an existential crisis.” He lashed out at “radical environmentalists” and said they were not fighting fair.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Our opponents are not entitled to their own facts,” he declared to rousing applause.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Notley spoke next. She made fun of coffee shop hipsters in other Canadian cities. She spoke strongly in support of Alberta and the oil business. She received polite, muted applause. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau spoke to an audience at the city’s chamber of commerce later the same day. A large pro-oil and pro-pipeline protest shut down a city block outside the hotel where Mr. Trudeau was for the chamber luncheon. Inside, he received a cold reception.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
George Fink, who founded the small oil company <span class="companylink">Bonterra Energy Corp</span>. in 1998, speaks in a measured tone, but his message is declarative: The Prime Minister is failing Alberta. It starts with the Trans Mountain pipeline, which is going through more consultations after a loss in court over its approval. Mr. Fink and others believe Mr. Trudeau would act unilaterally if he cared about Alberta.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Shouldn’t you be strong enough to say, ‘Look, we’re just going to proceed with Trans Mountain?’ ” Mr. Fink said in a boardroom on a Friday afternoon as snow began to fall after a warm, dry week.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Fink, who is in his late 70s and grew up on a Saskatchewan farm, is slowing production at Bonterra. He’s been through crashes before, but his company, a light oil producer, has paid out more than $1-billion in dividends during its two-decade run.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One move is to reduce the number of times the horse’s head of a pump jack bobs up and down – to five a minute from 10. This would cut production and reduce royalty costs, but Bonterra still has to pay its field operators. Mr. Fink doesn’t want to turn off the switch completely. He doesn’t want to put his field operators out of work. He knows them and their families. Christmas is less than a month away. “I don’t really have the heart to turn it off for a month or two,” he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He feels Mr. Trudeau has written off the Prairies for the Liberals in next year’s federal election. He says the general corporate tax cut the Liberals introduced on Nov. 21 doesn’t really help Alberta oil all that much: He calculates that on a $2.3-million well, Bonterra could save $18,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He believes Canadians are making a mistake if they vote Liberal in 2019; if they do, he predicts the loonie will plunge.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“If that regime gets re-elected, we’re in trouble as a country,” he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Over at <span class="companylink">Total Energy Services Inc</span>., a drilling rig and oil field services company, Dan Halyk stews. His roots are also in Saskatchewan – tiny Foam Lake. His dad owned the one gas station in town. Mr. Halyk founded <span class="companylink">Total Energy</span> in 1997 when he was in his late 20s and has been CEO since 2002.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Businesses in Canada, he argues, are being killed by too-high taxes and too many regulations. And because of the Trans Mountain delays, he has shuttered five of <span class="companylink">Total Energy</span>’s 25 field offices in small towns, the first time he has done so.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“These towns are getting crushed,” he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">Total Energy</span> is shifting investment dollars to the United States. He said more and more drilling rigs are moving south to Texas, where there are profits. In Western Canada, in the winter of 2012, during the thick of the last boom, more than 700 rigs were working. Last winter, it was less than half that number. <span class="companylink">Total Energy</span> has a fleet of 116 rigs – a fifth of them in the United States. Every rig employs about 30 people, and drilling a well pays dozens in related services. In the summer, <span class="companylink">Total Energy</span>’s rigs effectively sat idle three out of every four days.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I can’t have a $30-million piece of equipment sitting around,” Mr. Halyk said. “As a Canadian, I’m sick to watch what’s going on right now.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The conversation shifted to skepticism of climate science – not uncommon in downtown Calgary. The <span class="companylink">United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change</span> in October again warned of dire consequences if human beings do not take aggressive action to cut back on carbon emissions. Some Albertans are wary.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I’ve been doing a lot of reading,” Mr. Halyk said. “We’re not having an open scientific debate.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At <span class="companylink">Surge Energy Inc</span>., a small oil producer, veteran oil patch CEO Paul Colborne embodies the Albertan oilman: Upset – yet still confident. He wants the Prime Minister to plough ahead on Trans Mountain and said Canada is crazy to sell cheap oil to the United States and then import expensive oil.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We’re just dumb people,” Mr. Colborne said over a morning coffee. “We’re really a dumb nation right now.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, he urged some calm. He had a chart that showed the oil differential has surged before for similar reasons – pipeline problems and refinery closures – but it always returned to normal. “Everyone’s hair is on fire,” he said. His confidence in oil’s long-term future is rock solid. He thrust up one arm to indicate demand. He thrust the other down to indicate the challenge of producing more oil.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And then, again, a conversation about oil drifts into climate science. Canadians need to embrace oil, Mr. Colborne said. Don’t be ashamed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“All I’m saying to you is the data is still unsettled,” he said. “I’m proud of our vast reserves of oil. I don’t want higher taxes. I don’t want massive deficits. Oil is not going anywhere. It’s the most important commodity in the world. We all need it.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Global oil demand</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There is global oil demand. The world guzzles a record 100 million barrels a day. Each year, production from oil reservoirs around the world declines roughly 5 per cent. That means to keep production steady, the world needs to find five million barrels a day of new oil every year. The volume is the equivalent of one new Canada of oil each year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This seemingly solid supply-demand dynamic gives Arun Chandrasekaran confidence. He’s the head of energy investment banking at <span class="companylink">National Bank Financial Inc</span>. in Calgary. He was born and raised in the refining hub of Fort Saskatchewan, near Edmonton. His banking career started in 2004, as oil was shooting through US$40 a barrel on its way, four years later, past US$100.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now in his late 30s, Mr. Chandrasekaran has already been through two busts. National Bank took hard hits during the most recent one. But the bank is a long-term backer of the oil patch. It lends to 110 energy companies, the most of any of the big banks, Mr. Chandrasekaran said. Its energy portfolio is now worth about $8-billion, up almost $2-billion in the past two years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We helped a lot of companies survive through ’16. Our support through this downturn? Unwavering,” he said. “We’re not going to react to these short-term blips. And short-term could be three months, six months, nine months. It doesn’t matter.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He pointed to a chart of the estimated global energy picture over the next several decades. Renewables surge, as does natural gas. Oil rises in the decade ahead and plateaus in the 2030s. In 2040, however, according to this estimate, oil remains the world’s No. 1 source of energy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The world needs energy,” he said. “And it’s not 10 or 20 years. It’s 50, 60, 70 years.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">‘I’ve got oil in my veins’</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Chris Graham has driven heavy-haul trucks in the oil patch for a quarter-century. He moves drilling rigs from one hole to the next. There have been good times. In the last boom, he was making $350 an hour and piled up as much as $90,000 in a month. His best year, he grossed $750,000. In fall 2013, he bought a new rig. Then came the crash. Mr. Graham had money in the bank and figured he had a good enough hand to ride out the bust. By late 2015, he folded his cards. He told the bank, “Well, I’ve got no more money to give you.” The bank repossessed the rig.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The only real winners were the bankers in that one,” he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Through the bust, Mr. Graham drove for others and did some work hauling construction equipment. He checked out the wild west drilling boom in West Texas last year. The situation back home started to get better this year. He lives in Saskatoon, and there is profitable light oil drilling around Kindersley, near the Alberta border.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In October, his luck changed. Mr. Graham is a regular Lotto Max player. On Oct. 26, after buying a quick pick Maxmillions ticket at Midtown Foods in Kindersley, his numbers – 19, 21, 22, 31, 37, 45, and 48 – came in. He won $1-million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I was shaking,” he said of his reaction. His girlfriend, at first, didn’t believe him. Once she realized he was crying, she knew it was real. “We had to check it a few times,” he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The first thing he did was book a trip to Hawaii. On the flight home, he readied his next play. He had work lined up in Saskatchewan. He was going to spend $320,000 to buy a new winch truck outright. No more banks breathing down his neck when things get bad. He eyed a <span class="companylink">Kenworth</span> C-350.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We were going to be givin’ ’er and going to work,” he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He knew all about the details of the West Texas Intermediate-Western Canadian Select differential but had not realized how fast things were changing, how tough things had become, until a half-hour after he landed in Saskatoon from holiday. He got a call and was told the work he had lined up was gone. Drilling plans had been cancelled. There were no rigs to move.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So Mr. Graham is making own moves. He’s turned his eye south. He’s still going to buy the new rig but is also setting up a U.S. limited liability company and getting other paperwork in order. He will put his winch truck to work moving rigs in the Permian Basin of West Texas, around the boom towns of Odessa and Midland.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At 43, Mr. Graham is all-in on oil, even though he knows it beats him up. Moving his work a long way from home, some 1,600 miles south, is his pragmatic bet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I have no confidence in the oil patch,” he said. “Every time I go through a bust, I think, ‘Man, I’ve got to find something better to do.’ You know what I mean? Then it picks back up. I’ve got oil in my veins. After 25 years of doing this, it’s all I know.”</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Notley’s cuts</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Alberta Premier Rachel Notley’s oil production cuts will bite deep into Canada’s first-quarter economic growth, <span class="companylink">Bank of Montreal</span> calculates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So much so that gross domestic product will expand at an annual pace of just 0.7 per cent in the first three months of 2019, according to Benjamin Reitzes, <span class="companylink">BMO</span>’s Canadian rates and macro strategist, and senior economist Robert Kavcic.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Absent the cuts unveiled by Ms. Notley late Sunday, growth would have been 2 per cent, meaning her order to restrict supply will cost Canada almost 1.5 percentage points.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As The Globe and Mail’s Justin Giovannetti and Shawn McCarthy report, Ms. Notley took the extraordinary step of ordering companies to cut production by 8.7 per cent, or about 325,000 barrels a day, starting next year. That sparked a jump in the western Canadian oil benchmark and put a fire under the shares of some energy companies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We had already built in production cuts of about 120,000 barrels per day in Q4, which were already announced by various companies, so the full impact on Q1 should bite less than the full estimate,” Mr. Reitzes said in a separate report.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Either way, it will put a serious dent in the GDP forecast to start 2019.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">BMO</span> has now cut its Canadian growth forecast for 2019 to 1.8 per cent, or down 0.2 of a percentage point, while bumping up its 2020 projection by 0.1 of a percentage point to 1.7 per cent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The expected rebound in production later in the year should contain the full-year 2019 GDP impact and potentially lift 2020 slightly, depending on timing,” Mr. Reitzes and Mr. Kavcic said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Indeed, we currently assume that production comes back online through the rest of 2019 and cuts are expected to fully unwind by the end of the year.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Alberta has been on a quest to boost prices and narrow the differential, starting with Ms. Notley’s plans to buy railcars to help get the province’s crude to market and climaxing with her order to cut supplies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That came after Finance Minister Joe Ceci’s fiscal update Firday, which forecast an average differential of US$29.25 in fiscal year 2018-19, wider than the US$22.40 projected in the last budget. It also forecast WTI will average US$64.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Ceci also pegged the 2018-19 deficit at $7.5-billion, narrower than what the budget forecast.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But, importantly, coming out of the last oil-induced recession, the province warned in the update of slower economic growth. This follows a solid run that, helped by a weaker Canadian dollar, saw manufacturing sales rise to at a four-year high and projections for oil production to gain 8.4 per cent over 2017-18.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But “moving forward, falling global oil prices and record highs for the Alberta light-heavy oil price differential have dampened growth expectations,” Alberta said in the update.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Some Alberta oil producers have begun to shut in production and weaker corporate profits will impact the investment outlook next year," it added.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Given that, the province cut its economic growth projections, to 2.5 per cent this year and 2 per cent next, from budget estimates of 2.7 and 2.5 per cent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The real question is how [fiscal year 2019-20] will look and, to be fair to the province, [Friday’s] report wasn’t exactly an ideal time to update the medium-term outlook given that a potential <span class="companylink">OPEC</span> move is days away, and the differential is adjusting after some temporary shocks,” said Bank of Montreal senior economist Robert Kavcic.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“That said, if WTI, the differential and the loonie stay where they are today through FY19/20, the province could be looking at roughly $3-billion of downside from the outlook published in Budget 2019 (a $7.9-billion deficit),” he added in a report released before Ms. Notley’s announcement.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Of course, a better base this fiscal year will help, and we don’t believe that today’s prices will stick."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">BMO</span> projected WTI will average US$63 a barrel in the 2019-20 fiscal year, or US$3 better than in the budget forecast. At the same time, a softer-than-expected Canadian dollar could “more or less” counter a wider-than-forecast differential, Mr. Kavcic said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"If prices play out this way, the medium-term plan could hold up. Clearly, though, a lot rests on <span class="companylink">OPEC</span>’s next move and the path of WTI into next spring."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As for Ms. Notley’s plan to increase oil-by-rail by 120,000 barrels a day, it’s “a step in the right direction, albeit one whose benefits are far out,” CIBC’s Ms. Pinto said.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">How deep <span class="companylink">OPEC</span> must cut</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Analysts expect <span class="companylink">OPEC</span> and its oil allies to agree this week to a production cut of at least 1 million barrels a day.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Joan Pinto believes they’ll have to go much further to balance the crude market and, in the process, help Ms. Notley rescue Alberta.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The cartel and other producers that agreed to a previous supply cap, known as OPEC+, meet Thursday and Friday amid expectations for a cut that would buoy the market but also amid pressure from U.S. President Donald Trump to hold prices down.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The producers, which include Russia, are expected to ignore Mr. Trump and reinstate supply cuts. Indeed, Russian President Vladimir Putin said on the weekend that he would continue to work with Saudi Arabia. That helped boost crude prices today.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But they’ll have to go well beyond one million barrels a day, to about 1.5 million barrels, if they hope to balance the market, said Ms. Pinto, associate, energy specialist at CIBC World Markets.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">First, Saudi Arabia has been the subject of global condemnation related to the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi. Then there’s the fact that the Trump administration granted several countries waivers from sanctions against Iran.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And, key to Alberta, there’s a huge gap between prices for Western Canada Select, or WCS, a blend of oil sands bitumen and heavy oil, and West Texas intermediate and Brent crude, the global benchmarks. That differential, while narrowing recently, costs Canada’s economy $80-million a day, the province says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Which brings us back to Thursday's meeting.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Yes, the Saudis had to pay the price for the Khashoggi scandal and ‘produce as much as you can’ was partly responsible for oil prices tumbling," Ms. Pinto said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"A combination of unexpected Iran sanction waivers and booming U.S. supply were also to blame," she added in a report.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"But the fact that the Saudis have already announced cuts of 500,000 barrels a day to December exports indicates that they’ve settled their dues and are once again taking charge of loose fundamentals."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are challenges amid the scenarios, of course.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The Saudis may like $70-80 oil to fund government spending, but the White House looks to keep pushing Saudi Arabia to keep oil prices low to keep pressure on Iran, with the Saudis on the back foot after the Khashoggi incident,” said <span class="companylink">Citigroup</span> commodities strategist Eric Lee.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Russia, too, is cool about cutting, given their significant output growth potential, and its tax system and floating ruble providing insulation from [U.S. dollar] oil prices. Putin has said $60 oil is ‘fine,’ but there are indications they may be willing to implement some small, gradual cuts, and even commit to future meetings to reassess market conditions.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">OPEC+ will “fall short” if it opts to cut just one million barrels a day, but slashing about 1.5 million will give the group “a realistic shot” at balancing the market, Ms. Pinto said in an interview.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Looked at another way, a decision for about 1.5 million barrels "is the tide that will lift all boats, WCS included."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On its own, the western Canadian benchmark hit “rock bottom” below US$13.50 a barrel in November, but ended the month above US$20, which Ms. Pinto said “aligns with our view that WCS is gradually turning a corner.” Now, of course, there’s Ms. Notley’s production cut, as well.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">JPMorgan Chase</span> analysts agreed with Ms. Pinto that a cut by OPEC+ of 1.5 million barrels is needed to stop prices from slumping even more.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Our oil strategists expect OPEC+ to scale back production by around 1.2 million barrels a day from October, 2018, levels for the whole of 2019 and by 1.5 million barrels a day in [the first quarter of 2019] if they want to prevent oil prices from sliding further,” said <span class="companylink">JPMorgan</span>’s John Normand, head of cross-asset fundamental strategy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"They estimate production cuts of less than 1.2 million barrels a day are unlikely to be supportive of prices as a decisive and meaningful supply cut is the only way to also provide confidence to investors who remain skeptical of re-entering oil lengths."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Based on a cut of 1.5 million barrels, CIBC’s new forecasts put WTI at between US$55 and US$60 a barrel in the current fourth quarter, and US$60 to US$65 in the first quarter of next year. For WCS, the bank projected US$20 to US$25 in the fourth quarter, and US$25 to US$30 in the first.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It didn’t change its projected averages for 2019 and 2020, which would see WTI at US$68.75 and US$66.75, respectively.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Saving at the pump</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What many of us want to know is what we’ll be paying at the gas pump.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Obviously, we're not going to save if oil prices rise with what's expected from OPEC+ this week.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But we shouldn’t be hit too badly, either, as Ms. Pinto sees it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Gasoline prices have declined from the dual effect of lower oil prices and high gasoline inventories," she said. "Besides, the refined fuel market has had its own set of idiosyncratic factors this year."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Among other things such as American gasoline and diesel stocks, the U.S. oil grade has lightened, which means refiners get more out of refining. As well, North America is moving into a period of lower demand.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So “even if we get OPEC+ cuts and a subsequent lift to oil prices, corresponding gasoline price increases will be relatively contained,” Ms. Pinto said.</p>

</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What to watch for this week</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The term no-brainer comes to mind as to whether the <span class="companylink">Bank of Canada</span> raises its benchmark overnight rate again Wednesday or holds steady at 1.75 per cent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Governor Stephen Poloz, senior deputy governor Carolyn Wilkins and their colleagues are expected to hold firm amid weaker economic readings and the slide in oil prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After the central bank raised its key rate by one-quarter of a percentage point in October, markets had wondered whether the next hike would come in December or January.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But now, "it’s a forgone conclusion that two months of weak GDP and the face plant in oil prices preclude a rate hike," said CIBC chief economist Avery Shenfeld.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Of more interest will be whether governor Poloz takes a cue from the [<span class="companylink">Federal Reserve</span>] in walking back some of its earlier hawkish talk about what’s in store for the coming year," he added.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Markets have come down to our view that only a further 50 basis points are bearable (with a terminal rate of 2.25 per cent), and will be looking for signals that the central bank’s thinking is drifting that way."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While some of the troubles with western Canadian oil prices was sparked by temporary refinery closures, it will take time to work off the inventories, said economists at <span class="companylink">Royal Bank of Canada</span>. And there’s weakness in global crude markets, regardless.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The potential downside risk from lower oil prices will likely reinforce the <span class="companylink">Bank of Canada</span>’s approach of raising the overnight rate very gradually," RBC said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The announced shutdown of the Oshawa car plant similarly presents a downside risk to growth that will keep tightening by the <span class="companylink">Bank of Canada</span> gradual, though the impact may be more of a 2020 rather than 2019 event," they added, referring to <span class="companylink">General Motors Co</span>.'s recent decision to shutter the once-mighty car assembly operation east of Toronto.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The central bank is, nonetheless, still likely to point to further rate hikes down the road.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What else to watch for over the next few days:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MONDAY</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We'll get a sense of the state of the global manufacturing sector as purchasing managers index readings pour in.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We've continued to see sustained weakness in this sector with Japanese manufacturing hitting a two-year low last week, while the latest Germany and France flash numbers also showing similar weakness for the month of November, with France only 0.7 points away from outright stagnation," said CMC Markets chief analyst Michael Hewson, referring to the fact that 50 is the PMI mark that separates contraction from expansion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"If this weakness is confirmed in this week’s numbers, it really calls into question expectations about the policy path of central bank withdrawal of monetary stimulus, or quantitative tightening that has been the hallmark of this year’s price action, particularly with respect to <span class="companylink">European Central Bank</span> monetary policy."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">TUESDAY</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">BMO</span> rolls out fourth-quarter results, following rivals that reported last week.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">Australia's central bank</span> is expected to hold steady on its benchmark rate and "signal that the first hike is still some way off," <span class="companylink">Capital Economics</span> said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Watch South Africa, too, as, according to <span class="companylink">Capital Economics</span>, third-quarter economic growth numbers are expected to herald an end to the country's recession.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WEDNESDAY</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's central bank day: Not only is the <span class="companylink">Bank of Canada</span> on tap, Fed chair Jerome Powell also speaks to Washington's Joint Economic Committee committee.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">Canadian Western Bank</span>, <span class="companylink">Laurentian Bank of Canada</span> and <span class="companylink">Roots Corp</span>. also report quarterly results.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">THURSDAY</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">Bombardier Inc</span>. holds its investor day in New York after a somewhat volatile period.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We expect the company to provide more transparency on its 2019-2020 targets (and possibly beyond) and maintain the high level of confidence it has demonstrated in its recent conference presentations,” said Citigroup analyst Manish Somaiya.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“In our view, the credit markets are very supportive of the current management team, though we would be the first to acknowledge that waiting one additional year to 2020 for free cash flow is a disappointment.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Given the focus on U.S. trade policy, today’s numbers on both sides of the border should also be interesting.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists expect <span class="companylink">Statistics Canada</span> to report that the country's trade deficit widened in October to about $1-billion from September's $400-million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Oil prices only started to plunge in October, so the trade file is expected to see just a modest impact in this report," said Benjamin Reitzes, <span class="companylink">BMO</span>'s Canadian rates and macro strategist.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"With oil prices plunging further in November, expect a further widening into year-end," he added.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The U.S. report, in turn, is forecast to show a wider shortfall of about US$55-billion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Also on tap is Mr. Poloz again, speaking to a business group in Toronto.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">FRIDAY</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As <span class="companylink">BMO</span>'s Mr. Reitzes put it, today brings the spin of the "employment roulette wheel."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Keeping with that analogy, <span class="companylink">Statistics Canada</span>’s monthly jobs report is always a crapshoot, with extreme volatility.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So keep your poker face: Analysts expect the report to show November job gains of anywhere from 5,000 to 25,000, with unemployment holding at 5.8 per cent or possibly dipping to 5.7 per cent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The employment roulette wheel managed to print a reasonable gain in October, following four consecutive big moves," said Mr. Reitzes, who expects to see net job increases of 15,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Looking beyond the headline volatility, the yearly trend in job growth has slowed consistently through the course of the year."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Observers expect the U.S. report to show November gains of up to about 200,000 jobs, and unemployment at 3.7 per cent.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These companies and organizations build exceptional workplaces with an array of progressive and innovative programs that make life better for their people. All the winners are leaders in their industry and able to attract and retain top talent, but that kind of success doesn’t just happen without committed effort. One key differentiator is that these employers invest in their employees’ personal growth by offering continuous learning and career development opportunities. That not only says individuals are valued, but translates directly into helping employees become more engaged and productive.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Typically, all of this year’s Top 100 offer a variety of possibilities, from leadership training and formal mentoring to experiential initiatives, such as <span class="companylink">Ceridian</span>’s career exploration program which allows employees to participate in job rotation, job shadow a colleague or swap roles with another employee for a month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A great many employers provide tuition subsidies for courses taken at outside institutions, sometimes without a maximum amount or even when those courses aren’t directly related to the job. Most also take advantage of technology to broaden their reach to employees by offering inclusive in-house and online training to upgrade skills. For example, <span class="companylink">3M Canada</span> features interactive online training, live virtual instructor-led sessions, videos and panel discussions during a dedicated development month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Canada’s Top 100 Employers are also breaking new ground when it comes to employee benefits. In keeping with the federal government’s recently extended maternity and parental leave policies to 18 months, both the City of Toronto and <span class="companylink">Vancouver City Savings Credit Union</span> introduced combined maternity and parental leave top-ups for 78 weeks, as well as extending the parental leave portion for new dads and adoptive parents. This is just another example of how the best continue to set the bar higher.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Methodology</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While the selection process to choose the winners of Canada’s Top Employers continually evolves to include new questions that reflect changes in the workplace, the underlying methodology has not significantly changed since the project began in 2000. The competition is and remains a catalogue of best practices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To select the winners, the editors of Canada’s Top 100 Employers at Toronto-based <span class="companylink">Mediacorp Canada Inc</span>. compare each organization’s policies to others in their industry and region to see whether they’re a leader. Each employer’s application is judged by rigorous criteria in eight key areas: 1) physical workplace; 2) work atmosphere and social; 3) health, financial and family benefits; 4) vacation and time off; 5) employee communications; 6) performance management; 7) training and skills development; and 8) community involvement.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Stock futures spiked and crude prices rallied early Monday after a weekend meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping yielded a truce on tariffs that will see the two countries halt additional penalties on imports during a 90-day window aimed at reaching a new trade pact. Futures on Bay Street followed suit, helped by a jump in crude prices. Energy shares in this country could also see some action at the open after Alberta ordered a 8.7-per-cent production cut to deal with dropping prices.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ahead of the North American open, <span class="companylink">Dow</span> and S&P futures were up by nearly 2 per cent. <span class="companylink">Nasdaq</span> futures gained almost 2.4 per cent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Overnight, world markets climbed with MSCI’s all-country index climbing to its highest level since early November. That index has now gained for six straight days. Emerging markets also got a boost with equities climbing more than 2 per cent and looked headed for their best day in a month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Oil prices and stocks have got off to a flier this week, both surging strongly on the back of the weekend agreement between the U.S. and China to defer any further increases in tariffs, while the rebound in the oil price has been helped by the decision by Canadian producers to cut output by 325,000 barrels a day, along with an expectation that Saudi Arabia and Russia have agreed to extend their oil deal to manage supply, raising expectations of an output cut which could be confirmed at this week’s <span class="companylink">OPEC</span> meeting,” Michael Hewson, chief market analyst with CMC Markets U.K., said in a note.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He noted European stocks started the week broadly positive and appeared headed for their best one-day gains since April. The best performers were basic resource and oil stocks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At a weekend meeting, the U.S. and Chinese leaders agreed to halt additional tariffs against each other in a move that prevents the current trade war from escalating. Mr. Trump also said China has agreed to cut and remove tariffs on cars coming into China from the U.S.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In this country, the Alberta government said Sunday it is ordering the province’s oil sector to cut production in the new year in a move aimed at curbing supply. The Globe reports this morning that Premier Rachel Notley  announced that Alberta’s oil patch [https://www.theglobeandmail.com/business/article-alberta-premier-notley-to-address-province-on-industry-wide-limits-on/] will need to cut production by 8.7 per cent next year, about 325,000 barrels daily, to clear a large surplus of oil as production has soared beyond pipeline capacity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Looking ahead to the week, bank shares move back to the forefront on Tuesday when <span class="companylink">Bank of Montreal</span> reports its latest results. National Bank follows on Wednesday. <span class="companylink">Bank of Canada</span> also makes its next interest rate announcement on Wednesday but a somewhat disappointing report on third-quarter GDP on Friday essentially cemented market expectations that the central bank won’t move and raised a question mark over the possibility of an early year hike.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Wall Street, shares of U.S. chip maker <span class="companylink">Qualcomm Inc</span>. were up nearly 3 per cent after the company rejected a suggestion that its failed US$44-billion acquisition of Dutch company NSP Semiconductors could be revived. <span class="companylink">Qualcomm</span> called off the deal this summer after failing to get regulator approval from China. After a change in tone in trade relations between the U.S. and China on the weekend, the White House suggested that China was now open to approving deals that had been “previously unapproved.” But <span class="companylink">Qualcomm</span> said there is no prospect for reopening the deal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Overseas, the pan-European STOXX 600 rallied 1.6 per cent with most sectors in the black. Britain’s FTSE 100 gained 2,15 per cent. Germany’s DAX rose 2.4 per cent and France’s CAC 40 rose 1.48 per cent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Asia, the Shanghai Composite Index jumped 2.57 per cent while Hong Kong’s Hang Seng rose 2.55 per cent. Japan’s Nikkei finished up 1 per cent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Commodities</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Crude prices shot up as much as 5 per cent in early going on the U.S-China trade truce and the prospect of Alberta supply cuts and a production shift from <span class="companylink">OPEC</span> and its allies. West Texas Intermediate was trading in a day range of US$52.03 to US$53.85, having risen more than 5 per cent in the predawn hours before pulling back a touch. Brent crude saw similarly strong gains over night and had a range of US$59.85 to US$62.60.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The U.S/China trade war has weighed heavily on global trade and has generated concerns of an economic slowdown,” <span class="companylink">OANDA</span> analyst Dean Popplewell said. “Despite oil not been included in the list of products facing import tariffs, the market sees the positive sentiment of the truce.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Oil also received support from Canada, where Alberta indicated that it would force producers to cut output by 8.7 per cent, or 325,000 barrels per day, to deal with a pipeline bottleneck that has led to crude building up in storage.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">OPEC</span> and its allies will meet Thursday to discuss the possibility of cutting production. The meeting will be the last to include Qatar, which said Monday it would leave the cartel.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Markets are expecting to see a substantial production cut after Russian President Vladimir Putin said his country’s cooperation on oil supplies with Saudi Arabia would continue,” said Hussein Sayed, chief market strategist at brokerage FXTM.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In other commodities, gold prices neared a one-month high on the latest trade developments. Spot gold rose 0.7 per cent to US$1,230.81 per ounce in morning trading in Europe, having touched its highest level since Nov. 7 at US$1,232.22 earlier in the session. U.S. gold futures gained 0.9 per cent to US$1,236.50 per ounce. Mr. Popplewell said the trade ceasefire between the United States and China “revived investor demand for riskier assets.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Currencies and bonds</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Canadian dollar jumped early on, helped by surging crude prices and a decline in the U.S. dollar against its world counterparts. The loonie has a day range so for of 75.37 US cents to 75.99 US cents.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“For markets, there will be a sense of short-term relief that tariffs aren’t going higher on Jan. 1,” Sue Trinh, head of Asia FX strategy, said. “But we think the market had priced in a lot of positive news already after being flagged all month by both sides. A lot will depend on developments in the next 90 days, but given the U.S. and China are on different pages, we don’t think the optimism can last.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For the loonie, the week’s big economic events are the <span class="companylink">Bank of Canada</span> decision on Wednesday - no move on rate is expected - and the release of November employment figures on Friday. RBC assistant chief economist Paul Ferley says that bank is expecting a gain of about 10,000 new jobs for the month with the jobless rate holding at 5.8 per cent.</p>

Mr. Grewal now says he has repaid the debts, though he did not say how. He also said there is nothing “sinister” about the activities.

The Progressive Conservatives scrapped the province’s carbon pricing system and scaled back planned reductions in greenhouse-gas emissions, but the new plan does introduce an official day dedicated to picking up litter. “Of course these things are not solely about climate change, but they relate to climate change,” Mr. Phillips said.</p>

(“Atlas”), a wholly owned subsidiary of Atlas Biotechnologies Inc. announces that it has recently received an expansion to activities permitted under its initial Producer’s licence (the “Licence”) from <span class="companylink">Health Canada</span> pursuant to the Cannabis Act and Cannabis Regulations.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Licence allows Atlas to obtain, sell and distribute certain cannabis products, including fresh and dried cannabis flower, cannabis extracts, cannabis seeds, and live plants. Atlas is authorized to sell on a “business-to-business” (“B2B”) basis to Federal Licence holders which are authorized by <span class="companylink">Health Canada</span>, including primarily other cannabis producers. The ultimate sale of cannabis flower, oil and related extract products direct to public consumers by Atlas continues to be subject to completion of the terms of the Standard Cultivation and Processing Licence which was granted by <span class="companylink">Health Canada</span> to Atlas on October 12, 2018 under the predecessor ACMPR (Access to Cannabis for Medical Purposes Regulations).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Atlas has completed the final equipping of micro-climate cultivation rooms at its production facility north-west of Edmonton and expects to plant its initial crop in the next two weeks. Atlas has installed specialized equipment which will be used to extract and process cannabis oil for products and related isolated concentrates. The extraction equipment is designed to process hemp and cannabis flowers which are permitted to be purchased by Atlas from licenced third parties.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sheldon Croome, Atlas President & CEO noted, “We are pleased to be kicking-off our production, and of course, to begin generating revenue. Throughout 2018, we conducted extensive research on sourcing and obtaining a wide range of cannabis genetics from well established, legal sources overseas. Following the receipt of our Cultivation and Production Licence from <span class="companylink">Health Canada</span> in October, we commenced the process of acquiring a large inventory of unique, high quality and stable genetics, which we expect to receive at our facility in the coming weeks. We will have control of over 450 different cultivars, some of which are to be sold to other licenced producers, creating expanded genetic diversity in the marketplace. We are currently offering genetics for sale to producers at attractive prices, and without royalties or resale restrictions, which is not common in today’s market.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">About Atlas Biotechnologies Inc. (“Atlas”) and Atlas Growers Ltd.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Atlas is based in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada and its wholly owned subsidiary, Atlas Growers Ltd., is federally licenced for Cultivation and Production of cannabis products, with a focus on medical markets. Atlas currently has a purpose-built, 38,000 square foot facility and laboratory where it expects to produce over 5,000 kg of dried cannabis annually as well as capacity to refine cannabis into isolated concentrates in large volumes. Further, Atlas owns a 160-acre site that could allow for significant future expansion of cultivation capacity in Alberta, with a development permit in place for up to 1,000,000 square feet of additional construction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Atlas is well financed, raising over $24.3 million in equity to date, including $7.6 million related to acquisition of land and strategic investments, and also has available for future use a largely unutilized $6.25 million bank term loan facility.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Alberta Premier Rachel Notley is ordering a mandatory 8.7-per-cent reduction in oil[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/business/article-alberta-premier-notley-to-address-province-on-industry-wide-limits-on/] production to deal with a price crisis. As of January, production of raw crude oil and bitumen will be reduced by 325,000 barrels per day. That figure is expected to shrink as the glut of oil in storage is reduced. The mandated cut ends on Dec. 31, 2019. Ms. Notley said the action is necessary to reverse the widening price differential that she says could cause further harm to Alberta’s economy if not addressed immediately. The government expects it will be able to roll back the production cut to only 95,000 barrels a day in the spring after storage tanks begin to empty out.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A third weekend[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/world/article-macron-mulls-declaring-state-of-emergency-in-france-after-worst-unrest/] of nationwide protests from the movement group “Yellow Vests,” made up of largely working-class people angry about a planned increase in fuel taxes and their dwindling purchasing power, left burned cars and smashed store windows in several of the wealthiest neighbourhoods of Paris. One person died in the unrest this weekend outside of Paris, bringing the number of casualties to three. More than 260 people were wounded nationwide, at least 133 of them in Paris. French President Emmanuel Macron ordered Prime Minister Édouard Philippe to meet with representatives of the Yellow Vests and leaders of opposition political parties. Those meetings start Monday.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Doctors and opposition critics are calling on the federal government[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/politics/article-ottawa-urged-to-reunite-yazidi-refugees-with-their-families-to-help/] to resettle Yazidi refugees from Iraq to help those already in Canada who are suffering from pseudoseizures, a rare and extreme form of post-traumatic stress disorder triggered by extreme psychological pressure and believed to be worsened by family separation. Canada recently resettled 1,200 Yazidi refugees[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/canada/article-for-a-yazidi-refugee-in-canada-the-trauma-of-isis-triggers-rare/] from Iraq after the Islamic State unleashed a brutal campaign of murder, kidnap and rape on the religious minority group in 2014 – atrocities the government has since declared a genocide. Doctors and researchers believe the pseudoseizures could be reduced if they can eliminate family separation, and opposition parties are calling on the Liberal government to take steps to reunite Yazidi families in Canada as soon as possible.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">George H.W. Bush, who was U.S. president from 1989 to 1993, died late Friday[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/world/article-former-president-george-hw-bush-dies-at-age-94-2/] at his Houston home at the age of 94. Mr. Bush’s presidency soared with the coalition victory over Iraq in Kuwait, but then plummeted in the throes of a weak economy that led voters to turn him out of office after a single term. He also backed Bill Clinton − who succeeded him − on the North American free-trade agreement, which had its genesis during his own presidency. Read David Shribman’s obituary[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/opinion/article-george-hw-bush-casual-american-giant-of-the-20th-century/] for Mr. Bush, where he describes him as “perhaps the most misunderstood and underestimated president of modern times.”</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For more than 100 years, photographers, photo editors and photo librarians working for The Globe and Mail have preserved an extraordinary collection of 20th-century news photography. Every Monday, The Globe features one of these images. In December, we’re featuring images that celebrate the holidays.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dec. 3, 1947: In 1947, Toronto’s Holy Blossom Temple received a special gift of a Hanukkah lamp. In this Globe and Mail photo, Rabbi Abraham L. Feinberg is seen lighting the new menorah, which was given in memory of RCAF Sergeant Lionel Roher, killed on June 28, 1941. Shortly before Sgt. Roher was to receive his wings, he was practising forced landings in a Harvard aircraft in Dauphin, Man., when he crashed into an open field. In a eulogy, the 19-year-old was described as being gentle, funny and intelligent, and having "a special radiance about him, too, so that passersby in the street would turn to follow him with their eyes and smile, remembering their own youth.” It was hoped that the memory of the young man’s radiance would shine on each December for Hanukkah. – Dianne Nice</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Premier Rachel Notley is ordering a cut to oil production to deal with a price crisis that she says threatens to gut Alberta's bedrock industry. She says the province will impose across-the-board cuts amounting to 8.7 per cent of output, beginning in January. Notley says the cuts are needed to reduce a growing glut of oil that's forcing Alberta to — as she put it — essentially give its oil away for free. While the rest of the world sells its oil for about $50 per barrel, Notley says Alberta oil is currently fetching just $10.</p>

The entrance pit to the cave is about 100 metres long and 60 metres wide, and while its depth is hard to measure because of the mist from a waterfall, initial examinations show it's at least 135 metres deep.</p>

</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The assertion from Alberta Premier Rachel Notley that crude oil in Alberta was now down to about $10 a barrel reminded me of a quote in the 1999 book Natural Capitalism: <span class="companylink">OPEC</span> has ceased functioning because the price of oil has fallen to $5 a barrel, but there are few buyers for it because cheaper and better ways now exist to get the services people once turned to oil to provide.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The cheaper and better ways will be electric cars, alternative energy, rooftop gardens and other alternative food sources. True, these are not cheaper yet, but more and more people are realizing that global warming is costly and is causing new problems for society already.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The tax on carbon is a good beginning. Hopefully, it is just the first natural resource whose excess is causing CO2 in the atmosphere to continue rising. Other minerals now used in smartphones and in TVs ought to follow the carbon fees.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of course governments ought to shift subsidies from oil and other fossil fuels to companies facilitating the transfer of employees from industries soon to be phased out to those responsive to climate change. Global warming appears to be on-setting earlier than many expected, with global temperatures likely to increase by 5 C within some people's lifetime.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hydro and carbon reduction</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Re: Hydro too cheap to make solar power worth it (Nov. 29)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We live in a world dominated by capitalist philosophy, a philosophy that resents public enterprise and merely tolerates public corporations as a necessary evil.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It was vital that all of Manitoba be supplied with electricity, not just the most populated areas of the province. In 1953, a non-socialist government of the day directed <span class="companylink">Manitoba Hydro</span> (then called the <span class="companylink">Manitoba Hydro Electric Board</span>) to provide much-needed electrical power for all Manitobans. Its mandate was to provide electrical energy at the lowest cost, not like a private company that would be seeking maximum profits from its investment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Has <span class="companylink">Manitoba Hydro</span> succeeded in fulfilling its mandate?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Well, we are told that since its inception, <span class="companylink">Manitoba Hydro</span> has provided clean electric energy at or near the lowest price in North America.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We are told that our <span class="companylink">Manitoba Hydro</span>'s energy costs are still one of the lowest costs in North America. Manitobans who own or rent cottages in Ontario certainly can testify as to <span class="companylink">Manitoba Hydro</span>'s much lower power rates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We should also note that Ontario disassembled their public hydro company and privatized major parts of what had formerly been one public corporation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Critics who seek to privatize our <span class="companylink">Manitoba Hydro</span> following the Ontario scheme by dividing the utility's operations and selling off divisions to profit-seeking private companies are very critical respecting <span class="companylink">Manitoba Hydro</span>'s debt. No doubt Hydro is carrying a heavy debt load, but we are not told the value of all Hydro's offsetting assets, which far exceed its debt.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Furthermore, let us look at some of the reasons why Hydro is carrying a large debt load:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">1) Year after year, our Public Utilities Board denied <span class="companylink">Manitoba Hydro</span>'s rate-hike submissions — forcing Hydro to operate on lower rates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">2) Manitoba requires Hydro to pay millions of dollars for the use of water flowing through its generating plants — water which otherwise flows freely to the ocean.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">3) Hydro is required to compensate Indigenous communities in the north for disruption of habitat and resources vital to their traditional livelihood.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">4) Manitoba governments have required Hydro's construction contractors to train and employ hundreds of Indigenous workers at considerably more cost than otherwise available workers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Climate change is happening. Clean hydro electric power to replace carbon fuels should be an obvious priority.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What are the projected costs if we fail to do our part to reduce our national use of carbon dioxide-producing fuels? Do we need to press on with the construction of hydroelectric power generation? Certainly.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Do we need to follow Ontario's privatization of Hydro? I think not.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Re: We already pay for carbon reduction (Nov. 29)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Scott Forbes' premise that Manitoba should get credit from the federal government for our historical investment in hydro electricity must be music to Premier Brian Pallister's ears.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">However, there is no differential carbon reduction benefit accruing as a result of “business as usual." How we do better in the future is all that matters now.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Not seeing colour</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Re: Engaging white males (Letters, Nov. 29)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I am a 73-year-old white-skinned female. I am tired of seeing the colour of my skin attached to attitudes and behaviours that I abhor. White is a colour, black is a colour, red is a colour, yellow is a colour. We are born a colour. No control over that.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now attitudes, beliefs and actions, we do have responsibility for those, no matter what colour or gender we are. In my opinion, using a word for a colour, in this case white, as the descriptor of abhorrent and destructive behaviours and attitudes serves only to fuel the fire of racism and hate. If the goal is to promote peaceful relationships, removing a person's colour from the conversation is one step toward that.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Personally, I could start to engage more in the actions of respect and equality, if I didn't have the visceral reaction of feeling guilty and ashamed just because my skin is white, like those destructive attitudes and actions are called “white." It's like being painted with the same brush as a tyrant. My skin is white, and I am not a murderer, a warmonger or a tyrant.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even if crude shipments rise substantially, analysts forecast only modest profit growth, while other customers would be affected</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Canadian oil producers are desperate to get more oil out of Alberta, and they are turning to railways for help.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What is the upside here for <span class="companylink">Canadian National Railway Co</span>. and <span class="companylink">Canadian Pacific Railway Ltd</span>. as they haul more crude?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The question lands amid tremendous concern about the impact of low oil prices. As a result of years-long delays in constructing new pipelines, an oil glut is weighing on the price of heavy bitumen produced in the oil sands.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Western Canadian Select (WCS), a benchmark crude, trades at just US$21.93 a barrel – well below US$50.49 a barrel for West Texas Intermediate (WTI), a U.S. benchmark. At this price for WCS, some observers believe the Canadian economy is suffering losses ranging between $50-million and $80-million per day, putting pressure on energy executives and politicians to find a solution.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The most popular idea: Put more crude on trains. While moving oil along rails costs more than sending it along pipelines, railways can satisfy demand relatively quickly.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But investors who are wondering whether they should boost their exposure to railway stocks might want to temper their enthusiasm.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hauling crude is going to boost railway profits only marginally – perhaps by just 2 per cent, according to a recent analysis by CIBC World Markets. Even railway executives acknowledge that their pivotal role in easing the oil glut will likely be shortlived.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The pipelines will come. It's not a matter of if – it's when," Keith Creel, CP's chief executive officer, said during a conference call with analysts in October.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The railway's quarterly numbers show why the prospect of hauling more crude looks like an incremental benefit rather than an entirely new corridor to profits.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In its third-quarter results for the three-month period ended Sept. 30, CN reported total rail freight revenue of nearly $3.5-billion. But CN is diversified. Within this total revenue, the petroleum and chemicals division produced revenue of $665-million or slightly more than 19 per cent of the total.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And crude oil is only an unspecified slice within this number.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CP's third-quarter results suggest a similar role for crude oil.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The railway's energy, chemicals and plastics division generated $339-million in revenue in the three-month period, or about 18 per cent of total freight revenue.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“It's positive, but it's not really changing the big picture," Amaury Baudouin, an analyst at DBRS, said in an interview.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The good news here is that the numbers for these crude oil-related divisions are rising – by 25 per cent year-over-year in the case of CN, compared with just 8 per cent for gains in intermodal revenue and 3 per cent for automotive revenue.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But gains from here are likely to be limited.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When Alberta Premier Rachel Notley floated the idea of buying 7,000 rail cars to transport 120,000 barrels of oil a day, commodity producers warned that the additional traffic on the Canadian rail network could cause delays in shipping everything from grain to lumber.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In other words, crude-by-rail has limits on its growth. What's more, railways have learned from their experiences several years ago that demand for their services can turn quickly – encouraging them to seek longerterm deals.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to DBRS, drawing from <span class="companylink">National Energy Board</span> data, Canadian crude oil exports by rail fell to just 43,000 barrels per day in June, 2016, from a high of 176,000 barrels a day in December, 2014 – a 76-per-cent reversal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Kevin Chiang, an analyst at CIBC World Markets, said that demand for crude-by-rail could top 400,000 barrels a day, based on CIBC production forecasts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But even if the railways meet this surge in demand, it would translate into per-share profit growth of about 2 per cent in 2019.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“While not overly significant, it does support our view that the rails continue to see a strong earnings growth profile across their portfolio of commodities," Mr. Chiang said in a Nov. 18 note to clients.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That may be the best takeaway here. Demand for exporting crude oil is not a compelling reason to buy a railway stock right now, but it underscores why railways make excellent long-term investments: They are indispensable.</p>

International Energy Agency calls for countries to boost support for carbon-capture and storage technology; IEA executive director Fatih Birol is warning that the world will continue to rely on coal, oil and natural gas for several decades.</span>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Governments around the world need to increase support for carbon-capture and storage technology to avert the worst impacts of climate change, the <span class="companylink">International Energy Agency</span> urges.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As negotiators arrive in Poland this week for the annual United Nations climate change summit, IEA executive director Fatih Birol is warning the world will continue to rely on coal, oil and natural gas for several decades, and therefore must capture and dispose of the carbon dioxide that is emitted from those fossil fuels.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Coal-fired power, in particular, remains a key energy source in the Asia where developing countries continue to build plants to provide affordable, reliable power to their energy-starved people.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Birol is encouraging developed countries to provide financial incentives for the use of carbon-capture and storage technology (CCS) in the developing world. Over the past decade, support for CCS has totalled a mere 3 per cent of what governments around the world provided in renewable subsidies in 2017 alone, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Without the contribution of CCS, it will be practically impossible to meet our climate targets,” Mr. Birol said in a telephone interview from Paris.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Canada has been among the leaders in developing carbon-capture technology, with the Boundary Dam coal-fire project in Saskatchewan, and the Quest unit at a refinery owned by <span class="companylink">Canadian Natural Resources Ltd</span>. near Edmonton. A number of Canadian firms are also pioneering the use of captured CO2 in industrial applications, including the cement industry.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Canada is phasing out its traditional coal-fired power by 2030, but that policy allows for the continued operation of plants that are equipped with carbon-capture and storage technology.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Birol argues environmental advocates and government officials are too focused on renewable energy as the solution to climate change. He said they often ignore that with proper incentives, carbon capture can play a critical role, especially in developing Asian countries that rely heavily on coal-fired power.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">International Energy Agency</span> recently published a report on how the world could meet its goal of limiting the average global temperature increase to less than 2 degrees C, which was set at the 2015 Paris climate accord. To get there, the capacity to capture CO2 from power plants and other industrial facilities would have to rise to 2,300 megatonnes by 2040 from 30 megatonnes today.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Paris-based agency estimates a $40 a tonne carbon price or subsidy would be sufficient to support a major expansion of carbon-capture technology.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Renewables are very important but the giant problem is Asian coal plants, by far,” Dr. Birol said. "We can have as much renewables as we want, but if the Asian coal plants – which is such a young fleet – are with us, if we don’t find a solution there, we have no chance whatsoever to reach our goals.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Federal Environment and Climate Change Minister Catherine McKenna and her British counterpart, Claire Perry, are leading an international alliance to phase out traditional coal-fired power. While that effort touts the availability of affordable solar and wind power, it also urges those countries still relying on coal to capture and either store the CO2 underground or use it for industrial purposes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The phase-out makes sense in Europe and North America, where the average ago of coal-fired power stations is 30 years, and they are closer to the end of their commercial life, Dr. Birol said. Even in North America, it can be difficult and expensive to end coal use. The Alberta government is paying utilities $1.3-billion in compensation for phasing out coal generating stations there.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Asia, the average age of coal-fired generating stations is 11 years and, despite international pressure, countries such as China, India and Vietnam are planning major new facilities. Some 59 countries are either building or planning to construct about 1,380 coal-fired power plants, which would lead to a 33-per-cent increase in global coal capacity, according to the German environmental group, <span class="companylink">Urgewald</span>, which tracks the industry.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">OTTAWA — New court documents show public servants discussing the risk to taxpayers as successive federal governments have turned to sole-source contracts to buy desperately needed equipment for the Canadian Forces and others. The documents were filed on behalf of suspended Vice-Admiral Mark Norman, who is charged with breach of trust in connection with one such contract. They land amid frustrations with Canada's military procurement system — including because of political mismanagement — that have led to the need for quick fixes.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Women working in areas such as mining, finance and the armed forces will agree that these are still male-majority fields. But rather than criticize their chosen sectors for a lingering gender imbalance, they forge ahead - and implore other women to do the same.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I know it's cliché," says Lt.-Col. Maureen Wellwood from her office at Canadian Forces Base Valcartier, northwest of Quebec City. "But the best way to make a change is to be it."</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She should know. Wellwood served in the former Yugoslavia as an infantry platoon commander with the Peace Implementation Force, and in Bosnia she held the role of information operations officer with the Stabilization Force. This mother of two from a military family, who swore she'd never join up or marry a soldier (she eventually did both), feels like she won the career lottery by joining the armed forces.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Her desire to see other women join her field is echoed by Heather Christie-Burns, president and CEO of Calgary's High Ground Energy Inc., an exploration and production company with expected revenues of $50 million in 2018.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Rather than being on the sidelines or being in a position to be a critic, come here and work on the problems; there are amazing things you can do," she says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Both Wellwood and Christie-Burns, as well as Carol Banducci, CFO and executive vice-president of mining company <span class="companylink">IAMGOLD Corp</span>., have seen an increasing number of women entering their fields since they began their careers. And they all agree that there's more work to be done.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The way we make it happen is by really focusing on it and making it a priority," says Toronto-based Banducci, a mother of two adult children who started her career in finance and joined <span class="companylink">IAMGOLD</span>, a company worth more than $2 billion, just over 10 years ago. "What we've been doing here, to focus on attracting women to the mining sector, is to continually sponsor, promote and provide opportunities for women to advance. It's something that, as a board and an executive team, we embrace. We want to bring the best talent to this organization, and that means accessing a broader pool and recognizing the talent and skills that women can bring to our industry."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Women looking to advance in any career need to play an active role in building their résumés. For women in male-majority fields, according to Christie-Burns, that means rolling up your sleeves and getting involved in the operations side of things, which she did at the beginning of her career, going from chemical engineering at the <span class="companylink">University of Calgary</span> to running a field office at an oil-and-gas operation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"If you can get involved in something that's at the core of the operation, you'll learn lots, quickly," she says, noting that she was a bit of a novelty as a young woman in the field in the 1990s. "You need to touch things and see them with your own eyes. Afterwards, if you're looking at running a company or starting a venture, you need to be financially literate."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Banducci's advice is similar.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"What I say to women, especially young women, is to work outside their comfort zone," she says. "That's how you learn, that's how you grow, that's how you're able to take advantage of opportunities that don't necessarily fall in your wheelhouse."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Christie-Burns maintains she never had to change her personality to climb the maledominated corporate ladder, but she did alter her communication style.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Some approaches are more effective if you're dealing with a mostly male audience," says Christie-Burns, who lives with her twin 10-year-old sons and her husband. "I try to be much more succinct and direct and get to the point more quickly.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It doesn't change my personality, it's just a better way to communicate."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For Wellwood, an early attempt to emulate a stereotypical successful leader, by de-emphasizing stereotypical feminine characteristics, was called out by a colleague.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I had a really good work partner early on who took me aside and explained that I would be better off if I would be myself," she said. "Today I'm a really strong proponent of authentic leadership."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The best path to success, the women agreed, is to let passion lead.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I was never deterred from my chosen field because I followed my passion," <span class="companylink">IAMGOLD</span>'s Banducci says. "I had a real curiosity for business and I really enjoyed the math and problem-solving aspect of finance, so I followed that passion. And here I am."</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">THE WORLD'S ONLY mustard sommelier likes to start out with a brightly coloured mocktail consisting of mango juice, grapefruit juice and mango vinegar. The vinegar, Harry Lalousis says, has a vivifying effect, not unlike having a cup of coffee, while the grapefruit juice's acidity balances out that of the vinegar. The mango juice just makes it all taste surprisingly good. The drink has nothing really to do with mustard, except one of the condiment's benefits is that it, too, makes the body feel good. "Mustard helps our bodies absorb more nutrients than if we had not eaten mustard," says the employee of La Maison Maille, one of the biggest mustard makers and a subsidiary of <span class="companylink">Unilever</span>. Turns out, planting mustard seed in between grape growing seasons does the same thing for vineyards, pulling the nutrients up to the top, allowing wineries to quicken their turnaround times. "Good for the ground, good for your body," he says.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of course, we're not talking about your common yellow mustard - "Yellow what?" Lalousis deadpans - that occupies a beloved place on ballpark hot dogs. We're talking about Dijon, the mustard chefs use when cooking to complement rather than overpower their dishes. Despite its reputation for pungency and strong flavour, Dijon blends rather than fights other ingredients as, say, English mustard or chili do. "Adding a tablespoon of mustard to a casserole, for example, you're going to get a much better flavour than if you hadn't added it. It will go in, do the job and not leave the mustard taste," he says. A recipe he provides for a lemon tart cake that includes a dollop of honey mustard ends up being delicious, with the lemon shining through far more than usual and certainly more than expected. "In France, we don't use salt and pepper, we use mustard," he adds. That's probably a good thing since Dijon mustard already has salt in it as well as wine vinegar and, of course, mustard seed, which Canada produces plenty of.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Canada, primarily Saskatchewan (though the first crop was planted in Alberta in 1936), produced 175,300 tonnes of mustard in 2018, according to <span class="companylink">Statistics Canada</span>, but harvests widely vary because the plant is notoriously fickle. The country produced 235,600 tonnes of mustard seed in 2016, but only 121,600 tonnes in 2017. Lalousis says mustard seed thrives in growing regions that are very hot or very cold, and Saskatchewan in July has hot dry weather. But it can be grown just about anywhere, something his landlords have probably noticed since he tends to sprinkle the seeds around, though they do present an abundance of yellow flowers before the seeds are ready to harvest.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">How does one become a mustard sommelier? Easy, spend a big chunk of your life learning about it and put that knowledge into practice. Though "sommelier" is considered specific to the wine industry, it's just an old French word for someone who controls a specific type of cargo, so it theoretically, although not often in practice, could refer to anyone who has knowledge of a particular provision. Indeed, Maille employed mustard sommeliers when its Paris boutique opened in 1747.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lalousis, raised in Australia by Greek-Italian parents, started in his dad's fish-and-chip shop in Brisbane before the family opened a restaurant in Athens. It was while working at Divertimenti, the oldest cookery shop in London, that he was turned on to mustard and Maille in particular, so much so that he started working at the company's boutique in London.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On a visit to company headquarters in Paris, Lalousis was "pleasantly shocked and surprised" at the variety of mustards available, though not quite sure what to do with them. He eventually took them home, one by one, and created recipes that he loved for each. Those recipes made their way to the public, something Maille hadn't done before and proved to be a bit of viral hit, so much so that Lalousis started getting requests to talk about mustard. His boss in London, recognizing his enthusiasm, told him to go to Dijon, learn everything there is to know about mustard and become an expert.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since that time, Lalousis has spent his working life thinking about mustard, talking about mustard and creating recipes using mustard. Maille has 88 different flavours of mustard - everything from straight-up regular to ones that are made with Pinot noir, Sauvignon blanc, truffle oil and even botanicals such as lilac and violet. Just about anything can be blended with mustard, though Lalousis admits that Nutella might not be the best choice - unless you use honey mustard. And mustard can be used to enhance the flavour of just about anything, from sweets such as lemon tart cake and vanilla ice cream to more savoury treats like beef, gherkins and Bloody Marys. All told, Maille has created 240 flavours over the years including a gingerbread chestnut honey version.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Though Dijon and English mustards are the only ones that don't need flavour-changing stabilizers such as xanthan gum to keep them together, Dijon is the more versatile of the two. "A Dijon mustard's flavour does not last in your mouth so it doesn't take over your palate and sit there, whereas English mustard does, it kind of lingers in your mouth for quite a long time," Lalousis says. "It's such an interesting condiment. It's the oldest condiment in the world. We have references to mustard seed from Mesopotamia. We know the Indo-Europeans were eating mustard seed."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As becomes quickly apparent, the one thing Lalousis never gets with mustard is bored. Tired? Yes. But not bored. A day spent in Toronto in early November included talking on two television shows and then hosting a get-together for 21 people. By the time he got to his hotel, he was hungry and certainly tired, but after ordering a steak from room service, he asked if they could bring up some Dijon. "I said the word and my heart kind of opened up ... aahhhh," he recalls the next day. If nothing else, you have to admire Lalousis'dedication to the art of mustard promotion. "I was in Italy once and someone said to me, Oh, is Maille the Chanel of food? I said, Honey we're 300 years old, Chanel is the Maille of fashion." FPM</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The gravity and emotion of what the Ontario community of Oshawa is about to face with the announced closure of the <span class="companylink">General Motors</span> plant was captured perfectly in Globe photographer Fred Lum’s photograph of a burly autoworker listening to the closure news. The worker’s bald head is bowed, a union flag is furled uselessly in his hand.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It’s an evocative image and the death knell of the plant’s 2,500 jobs can’t help but prompt sympathy. But many sympathetic Albertans are also wondering whether the same thoughts have been spared for them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Calgary reporter Justin Giovannetti arrived back in Alberta in October after spending the past two years at the Ontario legislature. Before that, he had been The Globe and Mail’s Edmonton correspondent, based in the legislature. Justin says he’s been surprised at the level of anger and hurt he’s discovered upon his return, a simmering resentment rumbled by attendants at this week’s Calgary business luncheon with Finance Minister Bill Morneau and flicked at by Premier Rachel Notley and Calgary Mayor Naheed Nenshi.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We need solutions, not sympathy,” Sandip Lalli, the head of the Calgary Chamber of Commerce tells Justin in his piece published today comparing  Oshawa’s plight with Alberta’s[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/canada/alberta/article-albertans-feel-oshawas-pain-but-see-a-double-standard/] .</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Why we are not spoken about in the same context [as the auto industry] when they discuss the national economy, I don’t understand. I really don’t.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Justin crunched some federal data for his piece and found the auto industry contributes about $19-billion to Canada’s economy each year. The energy industry accounts for $120-billion. Over the past year, about 3,000 jobs were lost in the energy sector, about the same as will die when the GM plant closes in Oshawa. Both sectors employ about the same number of people – 99,997 in September in the energy sector and 111,000 for the same month for the auto sector.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But because Ontario’s population is so much larger than Alberta’s – 3½ times – the impact of the distress in the energy sector is much more closely felt: Calgary has a higher percentage of unemployed people than any other Canadian metropolitan area except for St. John’s.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“That is just jaw dropping. If you imagine a similar hollowing out of Bay Street in downtown Toronto no one would let that stand. The whole country would be jumping to the rescue. The federal government knows Alberta’s problem in theory, but I don’t think they really get it,” said Jean-Sébastien Rioux, a professor at the University of Calgary’s school of public policy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Notley spent much of the week promoting solutions. Her province plans to buy  new rail cars [https://www.theglobeandmail.com/business/article-alberta-set-to-buy-rail-cars-to-boost-crude-shipments/] to move an additional 120,000 barrels of oil a day out of the province, a workaround for the lack of capacity on pipelines.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That, writes Gary Mason, is something everyone should be worried about. But Gary makes the case that Alberta has little choice[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/opinion/article-why-canada-should-be-helping-alberta/] and the rest of Canada – ROC, an acronym that was once associated with people outside Quebec – Canada should be paying attention.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The province is also considering drastic measures[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/business/article-alberta-weighs-different-ways-to-curtail-production-in-the-oil/] , examining production cuts to reduce supply and providing incentives such as breaks on future royalty payments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even trucking the product has become an unlikely alternative, David Ebner writes in a piece about the  survival tactics [https://www.theglobeandmail.com/business/article-in-the-alberta-oil-patch-it-is-a-battle-for-survival/] people in the industry are searching for. David interviewed Ingram Gillmore, of <span class="companylink">Gear Energy Ltd</span>., who notes the only silver lining might be the wakeup call that the situation delivers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I hate to say this, but it’s almost good that pricing is so insanely terrible, because I hope it comes to the attention of people east of Manitoba,” Mr. Gillmore says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“All the anti-oil rhetoric, which is mostly fictitious, is suddenly going to become a lot less meaningful to people when they realize the Canadian economy is suffering. I hope that this is so bad that the rest of Canada wants to elect people who are going to support the energy industry.”</p>

Saskatchewan has pledged to study the measure.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">B.C. LEGISLATURE</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The B.C. legislature finished up its fall session on Tuesday and it’s likely every MLA was relieved to walk out of the buildings for a bit of a breather. The intrigue that gripped the ornate halls following the dismissal of the legislature’s two most senior non-elected officers deepened this week with a news conference by the pair to declare their innocence. [https://www.theglobeandmail.com/canada/british-columbia/article-decision-to-suspend-bc-legislature-officers-wont-be-examined-by/] Craig James, the long-serving clerk of the legislature, noted that he had made many moves over the past number of years to modernize the financial accountability in his office, noting that the auditor general had given his team a clean bill of financial health since he took over. That hadn’t been the case in the past.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Neither Mr. James, nor Sergeant-at-Arms Gary Lenz have been told why they are the subject of a criminal investigation. The Opposition Liberals, deeply regretting their actions last week to go along with the Speaker’s recommendation that the pair be removed, have been trying to reverse the order suspending them. It hasn’t gone anywhere. Legislature correspondent Justine Hunter writes this weekend to explain why the Speaker has the unique authority [https://www.theglobeandmail.com/canada/british-columbia/article-decision-to-suspend-bc-legislature-officers-wont-be-examined-by/] to operate the House as he sees fit.</p>

The officer had a high-profile role as the force’s spokesman in the hours and days after Polish immigrant Robert Dziekanski died at Vancouver’s airport after being stunned repeatedly by a Taser. Sgt. Lemaitre delivered the news that Mr. Dziekanski had been aggressive and violent before being stunned twice. In fact, a video later showed Mr. Dziekanski was stunned five times almost immediately after officers arrived. His only weapon was a stapler.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sgt. Lemaitre’s wife testified that although her husband had struggled in the past with anxiety and depression, his inability to set the record straight pushed him over an edge. He became abusive and angry before his death.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With a provincial election to be held on or before May 31 of next year and her province's energy industry in crisis, Alberta Premier Rachel Notley is essentially on her own.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The fact of her political isolation was made clear when she travelled to the federal capital this week to personally sound the alarm about the crippling toll an oil glut is taking on her province and on Canada's economy.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The situation has become so dire, she argued, that it justifies the buying, by governments, of 7,000 extra rail cars to make up for a dearth of pipeline capacity to get the oil to markets. She wants Justin Trudeau's government to pitch in.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But if Notley hoped that delivering her message within shouting distance of Parliament Hill would make a significant difference, she was wrong.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the House of Commons, her oil-by-rail solution found no champion on the opposition benches.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a boilerplate statement, the Liberals responded that a committee was considering all options. No meeting was scheduled between Notley and Trudeau.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The lack of resonance of Notley's message on Parliament Hill was made even more striking by the fact that MPs did spend a lot of time this week debating the crisis that has caused Alberta oil prices to go into free fall.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the initiative of the Conservative official opposition, the House sat until midnight to debate the issue on Wednesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The exchanges featured a lot of the usual reciprocal finger pointing about the stalled pipeline agenda but elicited little support for Notley's latest pitch.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On the contrary, Edmonton-Strathcona MP Linda Duncan, the NDP's sole Alberta member, encouraged the Liberals to decline the premier's request. She called the notion of shipping more oil by train an "absolutely reprehensible" proposition. She also said she understood that Notley was "desperate."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Those comments speak volumes about how estranged the premier is from her own political family.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These days no provincial relationship is more strained than that of the NDP premiers of Alberta and British Columbia. As he plans for next week's first ministers meeting, Trudeau needs not worry about John Horgan and Notley ganging up on him.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As for Notley's pro-pipeline Conservative counterparts in Saskatchewan, Manitoba, Ontario and New Brunswick, they, like Andrew Scheer's CPC, are content to wait her out in the expectation that they will be dealing with a fellow Conservative Alberta premier before July 1.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On the day Notley travelled to Ottawa to pitch her oil-by-train proposal, Alberta opposition leader Jason Kenney was stealing a page from the NDP playbook and arguing for a government-imposed cut to the province's oil production. He believes the premier's proposal fails to meet the need for immediate relief on the glut front.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There was a time when Notley could make up for the lack of solidarity of her fellow New Democrats and dispense with more like-minded provincial allies because she had the ear of the prime minister.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But in the wake of the Trans Mountain travails, her association with Trudeau has become a political liability. Many of the Alberta voters who want to vote the NDP out next spring are often as keen to send the prime minister a message by doing so as they are to secure a change in provincial government.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The days when Notley and Trudeau could hope to score points by showcasing their alliance are well behind them and, even if he is still willing to meet the premier part of the way on some of her demands, few believe it will make a real difference to her standing in Alberta.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Parliament Hill, more than a few Liberals feel they have already expended too much political capital on the pipeline issue for their own electoral good.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They believe Trudeau has already gone more than the extra mile by nationalizing the Trans Mountain pipeline.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">From a strictly partisan perspective, the path of least resistance for the ruling Liberals would have been to take a pass at keeping the pipeline expansion project on life support on the public dime.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That move stands to make Trudeau's left flank more vulnerable in next year's federal election.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Liberals can probably thank the NDP's uncertain performance under Jagmeet Singh for the limited damage to their brand of the Trans Mountain acquisition.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the same time, the prime minister's pipeline play has clearly failed to earn him any credit in Alberta.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An impressive politician in her own right, Notley will not be giving up the premier's office without a fight between now and next spring. On that score, her visit to Ottawa probably made for good domestic politics. But it also highlighted the fact that, in the possibly jaded eyes of former friends and foes alike on Parliament Hill, her government is living on little more than borrowed time.</p>

Armstrong has always been a particular talent, but Duncan and Yukon are definitely her inspiration. Slick plotting and good characters are hallmarks of this clever series.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A Noise Downstairs by Linwood Barclay (Doubleday Canada, 368 pages) Linwood Barclay is one of Canada's most successful crime authors, with fans galore. In his latest novel, he's got his usual suburban setting, but with a twist.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There's a ghost loose in the perfect small town. Is it real or a hallucination? Even with a typing ghost, you won't put this one down.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Marry, Bang, Kill by Andrew Battershill (Goose Lane Editions, 320 pages) Andrew Battershill continues to bring his absurdist flair to crime fiction with the story of Tommy Marlo, a mugger who stumbles upon a heist bigger than he can handle. When a hitman pursues Tommy to Quadra Island near Vancouver, both may have met their match among the locals.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hysteria by Elisabeth de Mariaffi (<span class="companylink">HarperCollins Publishers</span>, 432 pages) Novels of psychological suspense revolve around the search for a truth, something that is often elusive and embedded in power. To Elisabeth de Mariaffi, the first layer of fear in this novel is the lost child. But it is more deeply about a woman “who can't get anyone to listen to her or believe her. That's really about powerlessness, and it's terrifying."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Bad Daughter by Joy Fielding (Doubleday Canada, 368 pages) We can always count on Joy Fielding to turn out a well-dressed, well-developed psychological suspense novel, but her recent work featuring therapist Robin Davis is top-notch. The latest is a zippy page-turner with a family secret to be unearthed. This is the kind of tale where Fielding excels and Davis is her best lead yet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Cold Skies by Thomas King (<span class="companylink">HarperCollins Publishers</span>, 464 pages) Who can resist a character named Thumps Dreadfulwater? He's the Cherokee ex-cop-turned-naturephotographer in Thomas King's stellar series set in Chinook, Mont., near the Canadian border.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The plot, based on water rights, is as up-to-date as this morning's news. It's the best of the Dreadfulwater books so far.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sister of Mine by Laurie Petrou (<span class="companylink">HarperCollins Publishers</span>, 272 pages) One of the best first novels this year. This is a brilliantly conceived narrative with wonderful characters and great depth. Hattie and Penny are small-town sisters. It's clear there are many secrets in their past, some serious enough to make each dependent upon (and frightened of) the other. This is a great psychological suspense novel for a weekend or a plane trip.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mary Cyr by David Adams Richards (Doubleday Canada, 432 pages) Literary Canada including Margaret Atwood and Timothy Findley, to say nothing of Michael Redhill, have done mysteries before with great success. So why not the elegant stylist David Adams Richards? This is a marvellously readable saga of a woman who is intrinsically interesting and who moves through a truly memorable life – but there is a mystery in her past that is slowly revealed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still Water by Amy Stuart (<span class="companylink">Simon & Schuster</span>, 336 pages) Amy Stuart's debut novel, Still Mine, was highly promising. Her latest brings back the same characters in a new setting and proves that she is no one-book author.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still Water – where Clare and Malcolm return and are hired to track down a missing mother and son – is even better than her debut.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Moon of the Crusted Snow by Waubgeshig Rice (ECW Press, 224 pages) The rising literary star has created an unsettling story about a snowbound northern Anishinaabe community, where a postapocalyptic reality – no power, dwindling food, chaos – slowly creeps its way through the band. A young man, Evan Whitesky, seeks to restore hope and order to his community by turning to the land – to Anishinaabe tradition. A stellar Indigenous thriller.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">AWARD-WORTHY AND AWARD WINNERS Zolitude by Paige Cooper (Biblioasis, 248 pages) Paige Cooper's stories all contain similar harsh notes: war, disaster, alcoholism, pedophilia, indentured servitude, police brutality, mistreated dinosaurs. She finds moments of beauty (or maybe it is just truth) in such landscapes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The surreal, sometimes fantastical worlds of these stories are so wholly realized, stepping into them is a pleasing form of disorientation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Saturday Night Ghost Club by Craig Davidson (Knopf Canada, 272 pages) Craig Davidson is back with his first literary fiction since his Giller-nominated, bestselling Cataract City. Davidson returns to magical, seedy, slightly haunted Niagara Falls (a.k.a. Cataract City) for a story about childhood adventures, the human spirit and the haunting mutability of memory.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">French Exit by Patrick deWitt (House of Anansi Press, 248 pages) A story of a mother and her grown son, who lived a life of luxury in contemporary New York until they went broke. They then set sail for Paris. It is unlike Patrick deWitt's previous work, but it is stamped by his hallmarks: a dry comic touch, delightful and propulsive dialogue and a dab of the fantastic.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Songs for the Cold of Heart by Éric Dupont, translated by Peter McCambridge (QC Fiction, 608 pages) A century-spanning, 600-pluspage story of one family that bounces from Rivière-du-Loup, Que., in 1919, to wartime Nagasaki, to modern-day Berlin and farther. Éric Dupont's century-spanning magical realist yarn has drawn comparisons to the work of John Irving and Gabriel Garcia Marquez.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Washington Black by Esi Edugyan (Patrick Crean Editions, 432 pages) The Giller-winning, historical, coming-of-age tale of George Washington Black, a boy born into slavery on a plantation in Barbados who goes on to much more in the world. And – without spoiling anything – the end of Washington Black is nothing like anything Washington Black himself could have imagined at its beginning.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Beirut Hellfire Society by Rawi Hage (Knopf Canada, 288 pages) After a friend's death, Rawi Hage started writing the manuscript that became his fourth novel, his first to return to the Lebanese Civil War since De Niro's Game. It's a turbulent and sometimes reckless novel through which many characters blaze for a short time before joining what Hage calls “a parade of deaths."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Red Word by Sarah Henstra (ECW Press, 400 pages) Its setting, an Ivy League school in the mid-1990s, is a representation of university life now familiar to us. Sarah Henstra's project in a way is to show it to us anew, and to do that she conversely draws upon the very old, including Greek mythology, Homer's Iliad and the Trojan War. On its surface, this is the story of a battle of the sexes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Its subject, however, is the danger of personal myth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Motherhood by Sheila Heti (Knopf Canada, 304 pages) The rather autobiographical examination of what it might mean to be – or not to be – a mother. In her own words: “I wanted to give a sense of how exhausting this question can be and how, in some ways, it just doesn't end. I mean, you can ask the same question for years and years and years and it's still the same question. There's something kind of crazy about that … I wanted to give a sense that it's endless and maddening."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Our Homesick Songs by Emma Hooper (<span class="companylink">Hamish Hamilton</span>, 336 pages) In a lyrical ode to this country's easternmost province, Emma Hooper takes readers back to the early 1990s and the beginning of the cod moratorium in Newfoundland. Times are tough and 10year-old Finn finds people are disappearing. Home has become a ghost town. But soon, his parents vanish – and then his dear teen sister, Cora, too, and somehow he must bring them all back.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An Ocean of Minutes by Thea Lim (Viking, 336 pages) The time-skipping story of Polly and Frank. In September, 1981, the couple arrive at Houston Intercontinental Airport, where time travel might be their only chance for surviving a deadly pandemic of flu. The premise Thea Lim sets up here allows for the most multifaceted examination of time's value. Time is Polly and Frank's shared past and the promise of a shared future.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Something for Everyone by Lisa Moore (House of Anansi Press, 304 pages) Another short-story collection from the Newfoundland author is the gift that always keeps giving.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There is the surreal (Santa Claus and a roof collapse) and the current (a story set in the aftermath of the the Pulse Nightclub shooting) in this go-round. She whets the imagination most when diving into the winded underbelly of St. John's, and the prostitutes and serial rapists and unsavoury types you won't find in a tourism ad.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Land Mammals and Sea Creatures by Jen Neale (ECW Press, 288 pages) Jen Neale's novel approaches suicide through both realism and magical thinking. In the opening pages, a blue whale beaches itself, seemingly on purpose, followed by the self-destruction of many more animals, birds and sea creatures, all coinciding with the arrival in town of a stranger who is herself obsessed with self-selected death. Such openness on this subject is a welcome change.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Warlight by Michael Ondaatje (McClelland & Stewart, 304 pages) Every sentence Michael Ondaatje writes defies gravity with its elegance, yet is weighty with significance. Water rushes out of taps “like time itself." There are baffling loose ends and moments of tension. And yet, underneath the uncertainty, there is a sturdy cohesion that makes this one of Ondaatje's most successful and satisfying novels.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dear Evelyn by Kathy Page (Biblioasis, 328 pages) Although the historical events of its backdrop, the Second World War in particular, clearly influence the family's lives, the story remains personal and intimate in focus. What this painstaking and painful account of a marriage relies on, as much as its period detail, is its precise ruminations on the nature of affection and resentment, and on how love can persist in the face of cruelty.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Split Tooth by Tanya Tagaq (Viking, 208 pages) Tanya Tagaq offers a still too rare glimpse of the inner lives of young people, particularly girls and women, living in northern and rural communities. This is her story, “but it's also not. This book was written for my own heart, and because I'm Inuk – because I'm an Indigenous woman – I'm assuming others will find alignment with it," she explains.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“But also, whoever wants to feel these things, to heal from it or get insight into what it feels like to be an Indigenous woman, it's like right on."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Vi by Kim Thuy, translated by Sheila Fischman (<span class="companylink">Random House Canada</span>, 144 pages) The deep subject of this story is what Kim Thuy calls “the invisible strength" of women, especially Vietnamese women, whose men, during the war, made a more obvious display of strength as soldiers. Patience, endurance and service to others are the pillars of this strength, which is not all about self-sacrifice. “We often misinterpret Asian women as kind, submissive and obedient."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Women Talking: A Novel by Miriam Toews (Knopf Canada, 240 pages) 1. Do nothing. 2. Stay and fight. 3.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Leave. These are the choices being talked out by a group of women in Miriam Toews's understated, insistent new novel about sexual assault. It's quiet, consisting mainly of dialogue among women who have known one another their entire lives, the lack of quotation marks reinforcing that their spoken thoughts are the main story, not accessories.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jonny Appleseed by Joshua Whitehead (Arsenal Pulp Press, 224 pages) Every so often, a book comes along that feels like a milestone, with revolution nestled beneath every sentence, every word. This is one of those books. Love, in all its forms, permeates this novel.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Complicated love, messy love, nourishing love, platonic love, sexual love, familial love, secret love. Every character in this book is portrayed with empathy and understanding.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CANADIAN LITERATURE Original Prin by Randy Boyagoda (Biblioasis, 224 pages) “Eight months before he became a suicide bomber, Prin went to the zoo with his family," the novel begins. Randy Boyagoda unpacks ideas of faith, fanaticism and family duty, while propelling readers to the final page to find out how his prophetic opening line will come to pass.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Theory by Dionne Brand (Knopf Canada, 240 pages) Dionne Brand gives voice to a narrator who doesn't ascribe to gender, known only as Teoria – a tortured academic perpetually led off course by a series of lovers, who each take the “all-knowing" narrator by surprise. Full of wry humour and biting critique, Theory is a masterful work from a writer who still knows how to have fun.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hider/Seeker by Jen Currin (Anvil Press, 224 pages) Jen Currin's characters are often abstainers of one form or another.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Or they try. They want to give up booze, they want to give up their former lover, they want to give up being angry. Desire is a difficult thing to excise, though, which is why a Zen Buddhist retreat is a recurring setting in these stories.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Grimoire of Kensington Market by Lauren B. Davis (Wolsak and Wynn Publishers, 350 pages) After the death by suicide of her two brothers, the author took to the page to make sense of her experience, but memoir didn't work. Only in adopting the magic of folk tales could she write what she had to say. Readers familiar with addiction will recognize much in Maggie's journey to find her brother in this story influenced by Hans Christian Andersen's The Snow Queen.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sodom Road Exit by Amber Dawn (Arsenal Pulp Press, 408 pages) Already in decline, Crystal Beach feels haunted – and that's before Star unwittingly unleashes Etta, the ghost of a professional “screamer" who died in a rollercoaster accident in the 1940s. Beneath this story is another one, however: As Sodom Road Exit queers the horror genre, it asks what queer horror includes and how we heal from that trauma.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Heartbreaker by Claudia Dey (HarperAvenue, 272 pages) The narrator in the middle section of Claudia Dey's second novel is a dog who named herself Gena Rowlands, but that is not the strangest part. Part of the pleasure of this novel is piecing together the culture that grew in this Petri dish of isolation, as told by people of “the territory" (population: 391) who have known only this.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Describing it all here would take the fun out of it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Oyster Thief: A Novel by Sonia Faruqi (Pegasus Books, 304 pages) Greedy human Izar's quest for aquatic domination threatens the way of life (and actual lives) of mermaid Coralline and her fellow citizens of the idyllic mer-village she has grown up in. And while yes, things get epic and dramatic, the charm of this beguiling novel is in all the details of the underwa-</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">ter world that Sonia Faruqi has dreamed up.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ayesha at Last by Uzma Jalaluddin (HarperAvenue, 352 pages) It is very loosely based on Pride and Prejudice, but that's not the reason to read it. Come for Darcy reimagined as a hyperconservative young man and Elizabeth Bennet as a wannabe poet frustrated by family obligation; stay for Uzma Jalaluddin's warm portrait of life for twentysomething Muslims in suburban Toronto struggling to honour their heritage while pursuing their dreams.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Twin Studies by Keith Maillard (Freehand Books, 576 pages) Keith Maillard's long-awaited new novel opens with an e-mail from twins Jamie and Devon to the Interdisciplinary Twin Studies Program at a Vancouver university. Despite weighing in at 576 pages, it never flags. It turned out to be the perfect length for this story of gender and sexual fluidity and the emergence of one unconventional family.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Late Breaking by K.D. Miller (Biblioasis, 288 pages) A beguiling marriage of Alex Colville and literature. The painter becomes muse in this interconnected short-story collection, each vignette inspired by one of his canvases. K.D. Miller teases out a unifying theme from his images: that of aging. Loneliness, death and a myriad other maladies pervade the characters, but she is also compassionate in doling out dignity at the end of it all.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Ghost Keeper by Natalie Morrill (Patrick Crean Editions, 368 pages) There's a remarkable scene early in Natalie Morrill's debut novel.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At a New Year's Eve party, people gather in a bright and merry home away from the crowds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They play music, there are midnight kisses, a young man and woman meet and will fall in love.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is written without a single ominous word, but the reader knows better. For this is 1932, in Vienna.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And the celebrants are Jewish.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Little Fish by Casey Plett (Arsenal Pulp Press, 320 pages) At either end of Casey Plett's debut novel is a search for queer elders. But this story is ultimately not about the past – it's about the present, and looking forward to trans futures. Her work is so clearly written for trans women. But the novel also deserves a wide audience. Every reader can get this part: Even as attitudes change for the better, even in a city, being a trans woman is exhausting.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Foe by Iain Reid (<span class="companylink">Simon & Schuster</span>, 272 pages) The story of a marriage after one half of the couple is selected by a shadowy organization for a topsecret mission. We don't learn much about Junior and the past of his wife, Hen – or their near-future world – but quickly and subtly, Iain Reid dissects their marriage with enough passion and pain that the book feels less like a novel than the final pages of a doomed diary.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Trickster Drift by Eden Robinson (Knopf Canada, 384 pages) Mave is a kind, intelligent, compassionate whirlwind, an Indigenous rights activist and a successful author. She takes in Jared, her 17-year-old nephew and the protagonist of this trilogy. Aunt Mave's apartment should be a refuge, but Jared, as the son of a trickster, is saddled with supernatural awareness. There's a ghost watching TV in the apartment and the wallpaper comes hauntingly to life. Monsters appear in unlikely places. But the book is full of light and love.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">IN TRANSLATION The Restless by Gerty Dambury, translated by Judith G. Miller (Feminist Press, 220 pages) Set during the May, 1967, workers' strike in the French overseas department of Guadeloupe and narrated by a nine-year-old girl alongside a chorus of ghosts, this story is about the psychological manifestations of slavery long after abolition.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Disoriental by Négar Djavadi, translated by Tina Kover (Europa Editions, 320 pages) A multigenerational epic of the Sadr family's life in Iran and their eventual exile, as told by former punk Kimia Sadr as she sits in a Paris fertility clinic, this one is full of surprises. Where initially Disoriental seems focused on Kimia's father and his pro-democracy activism, this is truly Kimia's story of disorientation – national, familial and sexual – and finding herself again.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bride and Groom by Alisa Ganieva, translated by Carol Apollonio (Deep Vellum Publishing, 248 pages) A runner-up for the Russian Booker Prize. Summoned home from Moscow to small-town Dagestan, Patya and Marat both receive a parade of unsuitable matches as their respective parents attempt to marry them off. Of course, Patya and Marat are best suited to each other, and when they meet, the novel takes a turn.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Convenience Store Woman by Sayaka Murata, translated by Ginny Tapley Takemori (Grove Press, 176 pages) A place called Smile Mart – with its uniformity, orders from head office and demand for sycophancy among staff – might seem the embodiment of soulless drudgery. But for Keiko, the 36-year-old protagonist in Sayaka Murata's weirdly charming English debut, it represents an escape from the bullying of family, friends and society to find a better job and a partner, to get married and have a baby.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Transparent City by Ondjaki, translated by Stephen Henighan (Biblioasis, 328 pages) Here, Ondjaki offers an experimental bit of magical realism in a story about a man in Luanda whose body turns transparent – symbolic of the ways the poor of Angola's capital are made invisible amid rampant oil and water speculation. A prime example of how translation broadens perspective – a diet of English-language writers will likely overlook Portuguese-speaking Africa.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Trick by Domenico Starnone, translated by Jhumpa Lahiri (Europa Editions, 176 pages) Daniele, the septuagenarian protagonist, ran away from Naples as soon as he could, only to be pulled back against his will when his daughter, Betta, demands he look after his four-year-old grandson while Betta and her husband are away. This, it turns out, is a kind of ghost story, haunted by the same mean streets as those of Elena Ferrante's My Brilliant Friend.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">DOWN SOUTH AND ACROSS THE POND Freshwater by Akwaeke Emezi (Grove Press, 240 pages) This debut novel is a contemporary, transatlantic story rooted in Igbo understanding. It is also semi-autobiographical, concerning Ada, a Nigerian girl who develops multiple selves, unfolding to a crisis after she experiences a traumatic event at a U.S. university.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The feat of this novel is Akwaeke Emezi's use of language to describe the experience of gods. A true original.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Happiness: A Novel by Aminatta Forna (Atlantic Monthly Press, 368 pages) Aminatta Forna is particularly adept at writing the politics of life.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Scottish and Sierra Leonean writer's latest depicts an encounter between a Ghanaian psychiatrist and an American biologist studying urban foxes. It is also a story about contemporary London.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Asymmetry by Lisa Halliday (<span class="companylink">Simon & Schuster</span>, 288 pages) Lisa Halliday is more Roth than Roth; in some ways, even more subversive, captivating and labyrinthine. She has said, in fact, she had an affair with Roth, and in one of his final interviews, Roth said this of the novel: “She got me." It's tempting to call this a cold dish of #MeToo comeuppance, but this book is a literary event, one of the most engaging, witty reads in ages.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sea Prayer by Khaled Hosseini (Viking, 48 pages) Khaled Hosseini's illustrated book was born from the moment the world learned about a drowned boy named Alan Kurdi.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Not as a book, necessarily, but as an idea for action – a way for Hosseini, as he sees it, to create art as an antidote to the dehumanizing effects of numbers and headlines.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Storytelling is not enough," he says. “But it's a very important starting point."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Immigrant Montana by Amitava Kumar (<span class="companylink">Hamish Hamilton</span>, 320 pages) A young Indian man travels to the United States on a student visa in the early 1990s, where he encounters a gulf of difference between his new home and what he left behind. But in the details, Amitava Kumar reinvents the immigrant novel here, highlighting the way an immigrant story itself is a responsive self-fashioning to the stories that came before.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Mars Room by Rachel Kushner (Scribner, 352 pages) With invention, hard-boiled compassion and an arsenal of meticulously researched particulars, Rachel Kushner petitions us to register the dehumanizing absurdities incarceration can inflict upon our fellow human beings. Heroine Romy Leslie Hall's first-person passages are imbued with intelligence, dimensionality and even integrity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There, There by Tommy Orange (McClelland & Stewart, 304 pages) Tommy Orange's debut novel is a master class in style, form and narrative voice. But will some non-Indigenous readers love this book because it's an effective, masterful execution of his singular vision? Or will they love it because they can selectively use parts to reinforce problematic ideas about Indigenous peoples?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For the sake of Orange's stunning novel, hopefully it's the former.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lake Success: A Novel by Gary Shteyngart (<span class="companylink">Random House</span>, 352 pages) In his first novel since 2010's Super Sad True Love Story, Gary Shteyngart turns his satirist's eye on modern life for a very few, very privileged – in America.

</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">People here still think the auto industry is the backbone of our economy. So when GM announced that it was going to close its century-old plant in Oshawa, the entire national media rushed to the city in search of desperate auto workers (who, despite the hardship of being laid off, will probably pick up new jobs pretty quickly in Ontario's job-rich economy). In a show of solidarity, Justin Trudeau even cozied up to his arch-nemesis, Doug Ford, to express his sympathy – even though Mr. Ford effectively blamed Mr. Trudeau's carbon tax for the GM closure.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">My friends in Alberta are a little quizzical about all the fuss. Sure, they're sympathetic. But unlike Ontario, Alberta has seen tens of thousands of well-paying jobs vaporize in the past few years. Nobody comes to interview those workers any more. “And all we get from the Trudeau Liberals is platitudes," Jason Kenney, Alberta's United Conservative Party Leader, says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To be sure, it's easier for the media to focus on one big sad story than on a hundred smaller stories spread out over time. But the impact of the oil bust in Alberta is far greater than a single auto plant closing in Ontario. Today, because of Canada's failure to get pipelines built, Alberta oil is selling for about US$12 a barrel, while West Texas Intermediate sits at about US$50 a barrel. To extract and ship costs more than it's worth . Rockbottom oil prices are already costing the industry $80-million to $100-million a day. Alberta oil companies, most of them smalland medium-sized, are hanging on by their fingernails. “Most of them can't raise a dime in equity," Mr. Kenney says in an interview.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Credit rating agencies are breathing down their necks. In the next few months we're looking at waves of layoffs. If this carries on, it will be a financial catastrophe."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Canada's failure to get pipelines built looks ludicrous to outsiders. It is a policy-induced catastrophe that is directly attributable to the Trudeau government, which has killed and blocked new pipelines and tanker traffic at every turn. The owners of Trans Mountain threw in the towel earlier this year because the risk-reward ratio looked too uncertain.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This forced Mr. Trudeau's hand and Ottawa pitched in $4.5-billion to buy the Trans Mountain pipeline and terminal, leaving it our only remaining hope. For now, anyone who wants to build a pipeline in Canada should have his head read.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">You'd think that a government so dependent on oil revenues would have a strategy to protect its greatest national asset. Instead, Mr. Kenney says, what Albertans see “is a government that seems deliberately trying to kill this industry in slow motion."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a desperate effort to get around the pipeline bottleneck, Alberta Premier Rachel Notley has asked the Trudeau government to consider helping purchase rail cars and locomotives.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She's still waiting for an answer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Ottawa is living on a different economic planet," Alberta Finance Minister Joe Ceci commented.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While we've been busy blocking pipelines, the United States has been building pipelines at a furious pace. U.S. oil production next year is expected to be 28 per cent higher than in 2017.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, leaders such as Mr. Kenney – a self-proclaimed freemarket conservative – are proposing quotas to cut back our own oil production in hopes of boosting prices. He says there's no other option. “Justin prattles on about growing the middle class," Mr. Kenney gripes. “And it's the energy sector that's been the greatest grower of the middle class. And that's all in jeopardy now."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Back in Ontario, Mr. Trudeau made no signal that he would bail out GM. The Oshawa operation has an underused plant that makes outdated cars nobody wants. But the bigger story here is not GM – it's Canada, and our ability to attract and retain industry.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And the answer is: We're not nearly competitive enough.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Canada is among the most expensive countries in the world to build cars and the highest-cost market for car assembly in the North American free trade zone," The Wall Street Journal says. Maybe that helps explain why Germany's luxury carmakers are stampeding into Mexico, where stateof-the-art plants are churning out BMWs and bypassing us.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Trudeau should be trying to make Canada more attractive. Instead he keeps making it worse.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Don Walker, chief executive officer of Magna International, sees Canada going in the wrong direction. With 22,000 employees, it's the largest automotive supplier in North America. According to Mr. Walker, carbon pricing, high electricity costs and labour costs are making it increasingly difficult to remain competitive against other jurisdictions that don't face “all these burdens."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“There is more to come," auto consultant Denis DesRosiers warns. “I just don't know which plants and when they will disappear."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fortunately, Mr. Trudeau doesn't have to think about that now. He has jetted off to Argentina for the <span class="companylink">Group of 20</span> summit, where he will fight for climate change and advance gender equality. Those are the subjects that really engage him. As for the middle class – they'll just have to fend for themselves.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Alberta Premier Rachel Notley said in speeches in Ottawa and Toronto this week that the province has decided to buy as many as 80 locomotives and 7,000 rail tankers - expected to cost hundreds of millions of dollars - to move the province's excess oil to markets, with the first shipments expected in late 2019.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's (a government) problem that they created and they have to fix it," said the normally media-shy CEO in an interview.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"They need to, in the short term, curtail production for both gas and oil. They have to do it thoughtfully so that it influences producers to shut in the lowest-value production and not shut in the highest value."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The intermediate-sized company was looking at raising its drilling budget next year to increase production but has changed its outlook in the last six to eight weeks to instead favour spending "a small fraction" of its 2018 budget of $600 million because of poor prices, Riddell said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The curtailment plan first put forward by oilsands giant <span class="companylink">Cenovus Energy Inc</span>. was supported this week by Jason Kenney, leader of Alberta's opposition United Conservative Party, who suggested all companies in Alberta be forced to temporarily halt 10 per cent of their production.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Any and all actions that can be taken to increase takeaway capacity are ultimately in the best interest of our industry," said Imperial spokeswoman Lisa Schmidt in an email.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Friday's fiscal update, the Alberta government says it now expects growth of 2.5 per cent in 2018, down from the 2.7-per-cent growth forecast last spring, because of lower commodity prices. It says discounts on crude oil are costing the country $80 million a day in lost revenue.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It has appointed a panel to find solutions to low oil prices and says it hasn't ruled out using curtailment or adjusting its royalty scheme, through which it gets a cut of any oil or gas produced from lands where it owns the mineral rights, if necessary.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The CEO of well completion firm <span class="companylink">Trican Well Service Ltd</span>. says he, too, is supporting production cuts even though they could translate into a short-term drop in activity this winter, the season when most drilling in Western Canada is done because the frozen ground allows access to remote sites.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"If the current situation stays where it's at, I think the industry could be in for a pretty a significant 2019 (spending) cut," said Dale Dusterhoft on Friday, adding he doesn't normally support government intervention in the market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Mostly, it's what's the alternative? The alternative is to let the market play out and that's a year away, likely, or three-quarters of a year, and by then we could have significant job losses and significant royalty losses for the government."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He said Trican expects to lay off about 140 people by year-end because of expectations of lower activity in Canada. It has a workforce of around 2,200 in Canada and the United States.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">EDMONTON—When he makes a run to be premier, United Conservative Party Leader Jason Kenney has said his platform could include a plan to auction off Crown land in the province's northern Peace Country to farmers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The proposal, announced at a Rural Municipalities of Alberta convention in Edmonton last week, alarmed the leaders of the Treaty 8 First Nations of Alberta, which encompass much of northern Alberta and northeastern British Columbia.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“People in Treaty 8 have inherent rights, right? And we also signed a treaty. That's our land, that's Crown land, and you can't do that without proper consultation,” said Darryel Sowan, chief administrative officer with Treaty 8 First Nations of Alberta.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Kenney told reporters at the event that he'd like to continue an initiative begun under former premier Ed Stelmach that saw public land sold to farmers. He said more details would be included in his election platform for 2019.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Under the Stelmach government, about 100,000 acres of Crown forest land was opened for auction to be cleared and turned into arable agricultural land, and those acres are now producing agricultural products,” he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Treaty 8 Grand Chief Arthur Noskey said Kenney's omission of the rights of Indigenous peoples in the area was “blatant disrespect.”</p>

Province reaches land agreement with Lubicon Lake Band after an 85-year dispute[https://www.thestar.com/edmonton/2018/10/24/province-reaches-land-agreement-with-lubicon-lake-band-after-an-85-year-dispute.html]
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Whose benefit is it to? Is it for him to advance himself, promote himself, or catapult himself into power? Is that why he's making those comments? To me, it's bribery,” Noskey said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The land is used for hunting, gathering and fishing — not to mention they're traditional lands with archeological sites.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While Noskey said that there must be consultation and consent with First Nations under law, he flagged environmental concerns as well.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The assault in the Treaty 8 territories through oil, gas, diamonds, now farming. All of this stuff. We're just whittled down where actually First Nations are kind of isolated, and I'm talking specifically to Treaty 8,” he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The issue is all of the sudden saying, 'OK, well I'm going to sell this land off.' Well that could be environmentally sensitive to the ecosystem in the area, nobody is considering that.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Stelmach government (he was premier 2006 to 2011) had undertaken an initiative to do something similar and about 120,000 acres were sold off over a number of years in Mackenzie County in the northwest corner of Alberta, according to a map from the county.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A government spokesperson also said that about 87,000 acres of public land was sold through nine auctions between 2011 and 2013 around Tompkins Lands, Blue Hills and La Crete. Through that, about $26 million was generated for the Land Stewardship Fund, which isn't considered general revenue and is regulated to be used for grants and purchasing private land to support conservation and ecosystem protection.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sowan said a similar effort to sell land in the Peace Country area by a potential UCP government would be met with staunch resistance. All 24 nations in the treaty would have to be convinced and sign on, and Sowan said there was “no chance.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Why are we going to allow them to sell our land off? We've already been put on postage-size pieces of land with reserves. You think we want to sell any more of it?”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">StarMetro reached out to the UCP for a response to the Treaty 8 First Nations' concerns.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The proposal floated by Jason Kenney at last week's Rural Municipality Association conference was just that: a proposal. Any sale of Crown land would of course comply with all legal requirements,” said caucus spokesperson Christine Myatt.</p>

</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Drama, agreements and a statement of condemnation at the G20</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It’s signed. The trade pact of many names — U.S. President Donald Trump calls it USMCA (United States-Mexico-Canada Agreenment), Prime Minister Justin Trudeau calls it CUSMA (Canada, U.S., Mexico) and president Enrique Peña Nieto of Mexico calls it T-MEC (Tratado Comercial Mexico, Estados Unidos, Canada) — is one step closer to replacing the old <span class="companylink">NAFTA</span>. Mr. Trudeau, Mr. Trump and Mr. Nieto signed the deal[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/business/article-trudeau-trump-and-pena-nieto-sign-usmca-on-sidelines-of-g20-summit/] this morning at the G20 meeting in Buenos Aires and the only thing left is for the countries' respective legislatures to ratify it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">However, the signing session wasn’t all back-slaps and handshakes. Tension remains because of steel and aluminium tariffs[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/business/article-trudeau-trump-and-pena-nieto-sign-usmca-on-sidelines-of-g20-summit/] the United States has imposed on Canada and Mexico and the retaliatory tariffs Canada and Mexico placed on U.S. products.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Also, the Trump administration is pressing Mexico to give the United States the power to punish specific automakers with plants in Mexico by making some companies subject to tariffs while exempting others. Adrian Morrow, our Washington correspondent, explains it would allow the White House to favour some companies[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/business/article-usmca-deal-to-be-signed-by-us-mexico-and-canada/] by giving them room to expand and punish others (<span class="companylink">General Motors</span> anyone?) by leaving some of their production unprotected.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So what does it all mean? Lawrence Herman, a former Canadian diplomat who practices international trade law at Herman & Associates, explains what comes after the trade agreement is signed[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/business/commentary/article-the-usmca-has-been-signed-what-comes-next/] by the three countries' legislatures, including where there might be sticking points.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">All this North American trade friction, though, is dwarfed by the trade war between the U.S. and China[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/world/article-g20-summit-opens-in-argentina-under-shadow-of-china-us-tensions/] . The White House is still on track to impose tariffs on US$200-billion of Chinese imports in January. Mr. Trump is to meet Chinese President Xi Jinping on Saturday. Mr. Trump signalled today things look good, but really, does anyone know what he is thinking. Michael Babad writes this morning[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/business/briefing/article-summit-may-mark-new-low-for-an-irrelevant-g20-and-false-dawn-for/] how what happens during the meeting will signal how markets respond Monday.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Reporter must give RCMP material about accused terrorist: Supreme Court</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In an unanimous decision, <span class="companylink">Canada’s Supreme Court</span> ruled 9-0 that the state’s interest in prosecuting crime outweighs the media’s right to privacy[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/canada/article-reporter-must-give-rcmp-material-about-accused-terrorist-supreme/] in gathering the news. The decision reaffirms a lower court’s ruling that <span class="companylink">Vice Media</span> reporter Ben Makuch must give the RCMP material he gathered for stories about an accused terrorist. In 2014, Mr. Makuch wrote about Farah Mohamed Shirdon, formerly of Calgary, who left Canada to join the Islamic State and subsequently appeared in an ISIL propaganda video.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The RCMP obtained a production order under the Criminal Code, directing Mr. Makuch to provide documents and data relating to communications with Mr. Shirdon. Vice News brought an application to quash the order, but it was dismissed –a decision upheld by the Ontario Court of Appeal and the Supreme Court.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">B.C. joins Alberta in pledge to impose cleanup timelines on oil, gas wells</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The reaction to last weekend’s Globe and Mail investigative report on idle oil and gas wells continues. Yesterday, British Columbia announced it will impose timelines to clean up thousands of idle oil and gas wells[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/canada/article-bc-to-put-owners-on-the-clock-for-cleaning-up-idle-oil-and-gas-wells/] and Saskatchewan has pledged to study the measure. The move follows a similar commitment from Alberta earlier in the week. The Globe’s six-month investigation[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/canada/article-hustle-in-the-oil-patch-inside-a-looming-financial-and-environmental/] showed that about 20 per cent of all oil and gas wells in B.C., Alberta and Saskatchewan are inactive, and that there are 54,147 more idle wells in those three provinces than there were in 2005.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Gary Mason weighs in on the looming economic and environmental disaster in his weekend column, and argues that oil-producing provinces seem to be content to kick this problem down the road: " There is a complete lack of transparency[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/opinion/article-surprise-oil-companies-plan-to-stick-us-with-a-massive-clean-up-bill/] around the level of risk facing taxpayers in all this – taxpayers who are going to be left holding the bag to the tune of multiple billions of dollars. But the government of Alberta, for one, isn’t going to say peep to an oil industry under siege. Can you imagine Premier Rachel Notley saying: ‘We are going to toughen up the rules around inactive wells and it’s going to cost you money.’ ”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Grewal resignation announcement made days after PMO learned of RCMP probe, met with MP</p>

As Daniel Leblanc reports, the Prime Minister’s Office learned two weeks ago that police were asking questions about Mr. Grewal’s financial affairs, which prompted the first meeting with senior PMO officials on Monday, Nov. 19. At that meeting, Mr. Grewal suggested he would receive treatment for his gambling problem and that he could manage his debt. but by Wednesday, Nov. 21, it had become clear that Mr. Grewal was struggling to deal with debt that totalled more than $1-million. Mr. Grewal announced on Nov. 22 that he would resign as the MP for Brampton East, although he has not yet done so officially.</p>

Her experiences as a queer trans girl, she writes, place her in a unique position “to address what makes a good man.”</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Woo Woo: How I Survived Ice Hockey, Drug Raids, Demons, and My Crazy Chinese Family by Lindsay Wong (Arsenal Pulp Press, 316 pages)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lindsay Wong was raised in an affluent immigrant family rife with mental illness. Her grandmother was a paranoid schizophrenic; her mother was obsessed with ghosts, or “the Woo Woo,” as they called it. She explores all this in her memoir, which chronicles her life with mental illness, from childhood to her stint at Columbia a decade ago.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">100 Days in Uranium City by Ariane Dénommé, translated by Helge Dascher and Rob Aspinall (BDANG, 144 pages)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the late 1970s, twentysomething Daniel leaves behind his shiftless lifestyle when he ships out to slog through 100-day shifts in a desolate mining town in the Canadian North. The isolation provides a crucible in which Daniel forges his mature identity – while his cantankerous co-workers lose their own.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dirty Plotte: The Complete Julie Doucet by Julie Doucet (Drawn & Quarterly, 569 pages)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One of comics' most iconic series from the 1990s is finally collected in one extra-large volume. The Montreal-based artist made waves at the time for her unapologetically raw, purposefully female, sexually explicit comic strips. She may have stopped cartooning years ago, but this book ensures her legacy will have an enduring shelf life.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sabrina by Nick Drnaso (Drawn & Quarterly, 204 pages)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A young woman’s grisly disappearance is the fulcrum around which everything churns in Nick Drnaso’s consummate sophomore outing. Sabrina’s boyfriend, Teddy, pole-axed by grief, holes up in his former buddy Calvin’s condo. A newly single U.S. airman, Calvin is ill-equipped to deal with such trauma – or the increasingly unhinged online conspiracy theories that beset the two friends and Sabrina’s sister.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Shit Is Real by Aisha Franz, translated by Nicholas Houde. (Drawn & Quarterly, 288 pages)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is indeed when a brokenhearted woman in a strange near-future slowly ventures deeper and deeper into the life of her glamorous neighbour, who happens to drop her apartment key card en route to a business trip. Beware those who enter. Depression and loneliness – and how people cope – are aptly explored through Aisha Franz’s often surreal pencil drawings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Young Frances by Hartley Lin (AdHouse Books, 144 pages)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is an odd thing, a graphic novel about finding yourself through work, but it also includes an unexpected romance. It delivers the ironic outsider viewpoint so central to this populist genre, yet also reproduces some of the whimsy and warmth of the comic book. Hartley Lin’s drawings are both wonderfully approachable and highly expressive.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Berlin by Jason Lutes (Drawn & Quarterly, 592 pages)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One of comics’ great epics finally concludes after more than two decades. Berlin, 1928: Journalist Kurt Severing and art student Marthe Mueller strike up a shaky but intellectually fertile affair. The lives they touch create an encyclopedic cross-section of typical Berliners, a portrait encompassing both workers and beggars, Jews and gentiles, queer life and jazz clubs – and socialists and fascists.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Parallel Lives by Olivier Schrauwen (Fantagraphics, 128 pages)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Six short visual stories about the fantastical futures to come for the cartoonist and his descendants. There are aliens, there are visitors from the even further future, there are secret messages to decode. Could this be reality? Olivier Schrauwen’s surreal style should actually give readers pause.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Somnambulance by Fiona Smyth (Koyama Press, 368 pages)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Known for gorgeous and groundbreaking feminist art, this Toronto legend is poised to break big internationally with her career retrospective. It collects three decades worth of joyfully squishy, hypnagogic riot grrl comics and art, drawn like a mashup of Frida Kahlo and Keith Haring.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Kelley Armstrong’s solid Casey Duncan series, set in Yukon, is turning into one of the best new finds of the decade. Armstrong has always been a particular talent, but Duncan and Yukon are definitely her inspiration. Slick plotting and good characters are hallmarks of this clever series.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Linwood Barclay is one of Canada’s most successful crime authors, with fans galore.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hysteria by Elisabeth de Mariaffi (<span class="companylink">HarperCollins Publishers</span>, 432 pages)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Novels of psychological suspense revolve around the search for a truth, something that is often elusive and embedded in power. To Elisabeth de Mariaffi, the first layer of fear in this novel is the lost child. But it is more deeply about a woman “who can’t get anyone to listen to her or believe her. That’s really about powerlessness, and it’s terrifying.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Bad Daughter by Joy Fielding (Doubleday Canada, 368 pages)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We can always count on Joy Fielding to turn out a well-dressed, well-developed psychological suspense novel, but her recent work featuring therapist Robin Davis is top-notch. The latest is a zippy page-turner with a family secret to be unearthed. This is the kind of tale where Fielding excels and Davis is her best lead yet.</p>

He’s the Cherokee ex-cop-turned-nature-photographer in Thomas King’s stellar series set in Chinook, Mont., near the Canadian border.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sister of Mine by Laurie Petrou (<span class="companylink">HarperCollins Publishers</span>, 272 pages)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One of the best first novels this year. This is a brilliantly conceived narrative with wonderful characters and great depth. Hattie and Penny are small-town sisters. It’s clear there are many secrets in their past, some serious enough to make each dependent upon (and frightened of) the other. This is a great psychological suspense novel for a weekend or a plane trip.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Literary Canada including Margaret Atwood and Timothy Findley, to say nothing of Michael Redhill, have done mysteries before with great success.

This is a marvellously readable saga of a woman who is intrinsically interesting and who moves through a truly memorable life – but there is a mystery in her past that is slowly revealed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still Water by Amy Stuart (<span class="companylink">Simon & Schuster</span>, 336 pages)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Amy Stuart’s debut novel, Still Mine, was highly promising. Her latest brings back the same characters in a new setting and proves that she is no one-book author. Still Water – where Clare and Malcolm return and are hired to track down a missing mother and son – is even better than her debut.</p>

A young man, Evan Whitesky, seeks to restore hope and order to his community by turning to the land – to Anishinaabe tradition. A stellar Indigenous thriller.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Paige Cooper’s stories all contain similar harsh notes: war, disaster, alcoholism, pedophilia, indentured servitude, police brutality, mistreated dinosaurs. She finds moments of beauty (or maybe it is just truth) in such landscapes. The surreal, sometimes fantastical worlds of these stories are so wholly realized, stepping into them is a pleasing form of disorientation.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">French Exit by Patrick deWitt (House of Anansi Press, 248 pages)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A story of a mother and her grown son, who lived a life of luxury in contemporary New York until they went broke. They then set sail for Paris. It is unlike Patrick deWitt’s previous work, but it is stamped by his hallmarks: a dry comic touch, delightful and propulsive dialogue and a dab of the fantastic.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After a friend’s death, Rawi Hage started writing the manuscript that became his fourth novel, his first to return to the Lebanese Civil War since De Niro’s Game.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Red Word by Sarah Henstra (ECW Press, 400 pages)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Its setting, an Ivy League school in the mid-1990s, is a representation of university life now familiar to us. Sarah Henstra’s project in a way is to show it to us anew, and to do that she conversely draws upon the very old, including Greek mythology, Homer’s Iliad and the Trojan War. On its surface, this is the story of a battle of the sexes. Its subject, however, is the danger of personal myth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Motherhood by Sheila Heti (Knopf Canada, 304 pages)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The rather autobiographical examination of what it might mean to be – or not to be – a mother. In her own words: “I wanted to give a sense of how exhausting this question can be and how, in some ways, it just doesn’t end. I mean, you can ask the same question for years and years and years and it’s still the same question. There’s something kind of crazy about that … I wanted to give a sense that it’s endless and maddening.”</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a lyrical ode to this country’s easternmost province, Emma Hooper takes readers back to the early 1990s and the beginning of the cod moratorium in Newfoundland. Times are tough and 10-year-old Finn finds people are disappearing. Home has become a ghost town. But soon, his parents vanish – and then his dear teen sister, Cora, too, and somehow he must bring them all back.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An Ocean of Minutes by Thea Lim (Viking, 336 pages)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The time-skipping story of Polly and Frank. In September, 1981, the couple arrive at Houston Intercontinental Airport, where time travel might be their only chance for surviving a deadly pandemic of flu. The premise Thea Lim sets up here allows for the most multifaceted examination of time’s value. Time is Polly and Frank’s shared past and the promise of a shared future.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Something for Everyone by Lisa Moore (House of Anansi Press, 304 pages)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another short-story collection from the Newfoundland author is the gift that always keeps giving. There is the surreal (Santa Claus and a roof collapse) and the current (a story set in the aftermath of the the Pulse Nightclub shooting) in this go-round. She whets the imagination most when diving into the winded underbelly of St. John’s, and the prostitutes and serial rapists and unsavoury types you won’t find in a tourism ad.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jen Neale’s novel approaches suicide through both realism and magical thinking. In the opening pages, a blue whale beaches itself, seemingly on purpose, followed by the self-destruction of many more animals, birds and sea creatures, all coinciding with the arrival in town of a stranger who is herself obsessed with self-selected death. Such openness on this subject is a welcome change.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Warlight by Michael Ondaatje (McClelland & Stewart, 304 pages)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Every sentence Michael Ondaatje writes defies gravity with its elegance, yet is weighty with significance. Water rushes out of taps “like time itself.” There are baffling loose ends and moments of tension. And yet, underneath the uncertainty, there is a sturdy cohesion that makes this one of Ondaatje’s most successful and satisfying novels.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dear Evelyn by Kathy Page (Biblioasis, 328 pages)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although the historical events of its backdrop, the Second World War in particular, clearly influence the family’s lives, the story remains personal and intimate in focus. What this painstaking and painful account of a marriage relies on, as much as its period detail, is its precise ruminations on the nature of affection and resentment, and on how love can persist in the face of cruelty.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Split Tooth by Tanya Tagaq (Viking, 208 pages)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tanya Tagaq offers a still too rare glimpse of the inner lives of young people, particularly girls and women, living in northern and rural communities. This is her story, “but it’s also not. This book was written for my own heart, and because I’m Inuk – because I’m an Indigenous woman – I’m assuming others will find alignment with it,” she explains. “But also, whoever wants to feel these things, to heal from it or get insight into what it feels like to be an Indigenous woman, it’s like right on.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Vi by Kim Thuy, translated by Sheila Fischman (<span class="companylink">Random House Canada</span>, 144 pages)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The deep subject of this story is what Kim Thuy calls “the invisible strength” of women, especially Vietnamese women, whose men, during the war, made a more obvious display of strength as soldiers. Patience, endurance and service to others are the pillars of this strength, which is not all about self-sacrifice. “We often misinterpret Asian women as kind, submissive and obedient.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Women Talking: A Novel by Miriam Toews (Knopf Canada, 240 pages)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">1. Do nothing. 2. Stay and fight. 3. Leave. These are the choices being talked out by a group of women in Miriam Toews’s understated, insistent new novel about sexual assault. It’s quiet, consisting mainly of dialogue among women who have known one another their entire lives, the lack of quotation marks reinforcing that their spoken thoughts are the main story, not accessories.</p>

Love, in all its forms, permeates this novel. Complicated love, messy love, nourishing love, platonic love, sexual love, familial love, secret love. Every character in this book is portrayed with empathy and understanding.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hider/Seeker by Jen Currin (Anvil Press, 224 pages)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jen Currin’s characters are often abstainers of one form or another. Or they try. They want to give up booze, they want to give up their former lover, they want to give up being angry. Desire is a difficult thing to excise, though, which is likely why a Zen Buddhist retreat is a recurring setting in these stories.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After the death by suicide of her two brothers, the author took to the page to make sense of her experience, but memoir didn’t work. Only in adopting the magic of folk tales could she write what she had to say. Readers familiar with addiction will recognize much in Maggie’s journey to find her brother in this story influenced by Hans Christian Andersen’s The Snow Queen.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sodom Road Exit by Amber Dawn (Arsenal Pulp Press, 408 pages)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Already in decline, Crystal Beach feels haunted – and that’s before Star unwittingly unleashes Etta, the ghost of a professional “screamer” who died in a roller-coaster accident in the early 1940s. Beneath this story is another one, however: As Sodom Road Exit queers the horror genre, it also asks what queer horror includes and how we heal from that trauma.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The narrator in the middle section of Claudia Dey’s second novel is a dog who named herself Gena Rowlands, but that is not the strangest part. Part of the pleasure of this novel is piecing together the culture that grew in this Petri dish of isolation, as told by people of “the territory” (population: 391) who have known only this. Describing it all here would take the fun out of it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Oyster Thief: A Novel by Sonia Faruqi (Pegasus Books, 304 pages)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Greedy human Izar’s quest for aquatic domination threatens the way of life (and actual lives) of mermaid Coralline and her fellow citizens of the idyllic mer-village she has grown up in. And while yes, things get epic and dramatic, the charm of this beguiling novel is in all the details of the underwater world that Sonia Faruqi has dreamed up.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ayesha at Last by Uzma Jalaluddin (HarperAvenue, 352 pages)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is very loosely based on Pride and Prejudice, but that’s not the reason to read it.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Keith Maillard’s long-awaited new novel opens with an e-mail from twins Jamie and Devon to the Interdisciplinary Twin Studies Program at a Vancouver university. Despite weighing in at 576 pages, it never flags. It turned out to be the perfect length for this story of gender and sexual fluidity and the emergence of one unconventional family.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Late Breaking by K.D. Miller (Biblioasis, 288 pages)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A beguiling marriage of Alex Colville and literature. The painter becomes muse in this interconnected short-story collection, each vignette inspired by one of his canvases. K.D. Miller teases out a unifying theme from his images: that of aging. Loneliness, death and a myriad other maladies pervade the characters, but she is also compassionate in doling out dignity at the end of it all.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Ghost Keeper by Natalie Morrill (Patrick Crean Editions, 368 pages)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There’s a remarkable scene early in Natalie Morrill’s debut novel. At a New Year’s Eve party, people gather in a bright and merry home away from the crowds. They play music, there are midnight kisses, a young man and woman meet and will fall in love. It is written without a single ominous word, but the reader knows better. For this is 1932, in Vienna. And the celebrants are Jewish.</p>

But this story is ultimately not about the past – it’s about the present, and looking forward to trans futures. Her work is so clearly written for trans women. But the novel also deserves a wide audience. Every reader can get this part: Even as attitudes change for the better, even in a city, being a trans woman is exhausting.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A place called Smile Mart – with its uniformity, orders from head office and demand for sycophancy among staff – might seem the embodiment of soulless drudgery. But for Keiko, the 36-year-old protagonist in Sayaka Murata’s weirdly charming English debut, it represents an escape from the bullying of family, friends and society to find a better job and a partner, to get married and have a baby.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Transparent City by Ondjaki, translated by Stephen Henighan (Biblioasis, 328 pages)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Here, Ondjaki offers an experimental bit of magical realism in a story about a man in Luanda whose body turns transparent – symbolic of the ways the poor of Angola’s capital are made invisible amid rampant oil and water speculation. A prime example of how translation broadens perspective – a diet of English-language writers will likely overlook Portuguese-speaking Africa.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Asymmetry by Lisa Halliday (<span class="companylink">Simon & Schuster</span>, 288 pages)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lisa Halliday is more Roth than Roth; in some ways, even more subversive, captivating and labyrinthine. She has said, in fact, she had an affair with Roth, and in one of his final interviews, Roth said this of the novel: “She got me.” It’s tempting to call this a cold dish of #MeToo comeuppance, but this book is a literary event, one of the most engaging, witty reads in ages.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sea Prayer by Khaled Hosseini (Viking, 48 pages)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Khaled Hosseini’s illustrated book was born from the moment the world learned about a drowned boy named Alan Kurdi. Not as a book, necessarily, but as an idea for action – a way for Hosseini, as he sees it, to create art as an antidote to the dehumanizing effects of numbers and headlines. “Storytelling is not enough,” he says. “But it’s a very important starting point."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Immigrant Montana by Amitava Kumar (<span class="companylink">Hamish Hamilton</span>, 320 pages)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A young Indian man travels to the United States on a student visa in the early 1990s, where he encounters a gulf of difference between his new home and what he left behind. But in the details, Amitava Kumar reinvents the immigrant novel here, highlighting the way an immigrant story itself is a responsive self-fashioning to the stories that came before.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Mars Room by Rachel Kushner (Scribner, 352 pages)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With invention, hard-boiled compassion and an arsenal of meticulously researched particulars, Rachel Kushner petitions us to register the dehumanizing absurdities incarceration can inflict upon our fellow human beings. Heroine Romy Leslie Hall’s first-person passages are imbued with intelligence, dimensionality and even integrity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There, There by Tommy Orange (McClelland & Stewart, 304 pages)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tommy Orange’s debut novel is a master class in style, form and narrative voice. But will some non-Indigenous readers love this book because it’s an effective, masterful execution of his singular vision? Or will they love it because they can selectively use parts to reinforce problematic ideas about Indigenous peoples? For the sake of Orange’s stunning novel, hopefully it’s the former.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lake Success: A Novel by Gary Shteyngart (<span class="companylink">Random House</span>, 352 pages)</p>

It opens with a Wall Street 1-per-center fleeing his marriage and autistic child … on a Greyhound bus. Super sad, super funny, super Shteyngart.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many sombre books have been written in an attempt to explain the concept of death to children, but few have done so as creatively and playfully as this one, where Norma hasn’t quite grasped what it means that her great-uncle Frank has passed away. It’s an unexpected but realistic take on the simple ways in which kids process serious events around them.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A boy riding the bus with his abuela (Spanish for grandmother) becomes transfixed watching women in their shimmering costumes and lush headdresses (en route to the Coney Island Parade, perhaps?). The text is sparse, as much of the book follows Julian by himself, wondering how he can imitate their look. It’s an intimate story with lofty ambitions about radical self-acceptance.</p>

This story is part of a six-month Globe and Mail investigation that showed about 20 per cent of all oil and gas wells in B.C., Alberta and Saskatchewan are inactive, and that there are 54,147 more idle wells in those three provinces than there were in 2005.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nobody should disagree that this sort of legislation mandating a clean-up timeline on oil and gas wells should be enacted.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the same breath I’ll say that I don’t want to see a set of rules enacted that force oil and gas producers to unreasonably catch-up the many years of neglecting this problem.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The oil and gas industry is vital to Canadians and hydrocarbon energy sources are critical to our quality of life in this brilliant western liberal democracy. Texas frackers have made North America energy independent and freed us from the extortion of Middle East countries. This is one of the biggest and most wonderful energy supply surprises in decades. U.S. state governments, like Texas, seem to have managed their wells, our Canadian governments seem to have failed miserably. - trishee1[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/canada/article-bc-to-put-owners-on-the-clock-for-cleaning-up-idle-oil-and-gas-wells/?commentId=2fb0fcca-b144-42c1-be67-be08884d005a]

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And oil companies were only too happy to pile on, reiterating their criticism of Ottawa’s proposed Bill C-69, which they insist will just add to the regulatory burden they say is already hampering the construction of pipelines and savaging profits.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A lot less was said, however, about the disturbing findings published in a Globe and Mail investigation last weekend that revealed an economic and environmental disaster looming on the not-too-distant horizon. And that crisis comes in the form of tens of thousands of wells, all inactive and many long since abandoned, with no evident plans for properly sealing them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Globe’s investigation[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/canada/video-hustle-in-the-oil-patch-how-large-oil-companies-shed-millions-from/] uncovered that oil and gas companies sell these distressed assets for next to nothing to smaller, far less capitalized companies that are more than happy to drain whatever revenue life there may still be left in them. The big companies are thrilled to shed hundreds of millions of dollars in clean-up costs off their books. If the junior buyer goes bankrupt, as is often the case, then it’s taxpayers who are on the hook for those remediation costs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Wells that aren’t properly sealed can leak methane – a potent greenhouse gas – into the atmosphere. These wells can also contaminate soil and water, and pose a threat to fish and livestock. Until the well is properly contained, the land it sits on is effectively useless.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Right now, there are 122,456 inactive wells in Western Canada (many for five years, others stretching to decades) and of that total three-quarters are in Alberta. The cost to properly contain the current backlog of defunct sites and potential future ones is forecast to be as much as $27-billion. The Alberta government has collected less than $2-billion in security to protect taxpayers against these liabilities. This differential represents a nightmare scenario.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Internal documents recently released by the Alberta Energy Regulator estimate clean-up costs for the province’s broader oil industry at $260-billion – which is nearly five times greater than the number it had been previously using in public. Any way you slice it, it’s a huge issue, and one that no one wants to talk about – certainly not the industry.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Discharging your environmental duties to someone else is not a good look - but in some ways you can’t blame these companies. If governments aren’t prepared to police the trading of junk assets, then companies will take advantage of that lack of oversight.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the U.S., there are far stricter rules governing inactive wells. In Texas, for instance, companies can only keep a well idle for one year. After that, they can apply annually for extensions that require security bonds. The regulations are intended to discourage companies from delaying their environmental obligations or dumping them on someone who can’t meet them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Not up in the Great White North. Here, it’s a free-for-all.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There is a complete lack of transparency around the level of risk facing taxpayers in all this – taxpayers who are going to be left holding the bag to the tune of multiple billions of dollars. But the government of Alberta, for one, isn’t going to say peep to an oil industry under siege. Can you imagine Premier Rachel Notley saying: “We are going to toughen up the rules around inactive wells and it’s going to cost you money.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">First, the industry would find a way to blame Justin Trudeau. Second, it would revolt until the idea was discarded.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since The Globe broke this story, the Alberta government has made a few vague commitments to start looking at the situation. The governments of British Columbia and Saskatchewan are being similarly non-committal about cracking down on oil companies and ensuring taxpayers don’t get stuck with their clean-up bills.</p>

Oil and Gas Commission said new rules for the restoration of dormant oil and gas wells will include timelines, in an abrupt departure from existing regulations that let companies put off cleanup indefinitely.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The move follows a similar commitment from Alberta, where the number of inactive wells has ballooned to 89,217. They are among tens of thousands of idle wells tallied in a six-month Globe and Mail investigation[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/canada/article-hustle-in-the-oil-patch-inside-a-looming-financial-and-environmental/] that showed about 20 per cent of all oil and gas wells in B.C., Alberta and Saskatchewan are inactive, and that there are 54,147 more idle wells in those three provinces than there were in 2005.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Such wells no longer produce oil and gas, but they have not been plugged. Thousands more have been abandoned, meaning they have been sealed but the surrounding land has not yet been restored to its predrilling state.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Neither B.C. nor Alberta will say how stringent the timelines would be nor when they will take effect. A spokeswoman for the B.C. regulator said it’s “premature to speak to specifics regarding the regulation at this time.”</p>

</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Michelle Mungall, B.C. Minister of Energy, Mines and Petroleum Resources, declined repeated interview requests through a spokesman.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Her office said the glut of idle wells is a “very serious issue” and pointed to legislation last May giving the regulator broader authority to impose the timelines. B.C. has also increased the industry levy to clean up wells with no legal owner.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">B.C.'s NDP government is aggressively promoting liquefied natural gas exports to lift the economy and spur increased drilling, even as an older era’s operations linger.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Globe investigation found that 7,382 wells – or a third of all wells in the province – are inactive, and the number of defunct wells (those with no legal owner, also known as orphans) has jumped to 294, up from just 24 in 2014, according to the B.C. Oil and Gas Commission.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Alberta and Saskatchewan have seen similar spikes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Adding to the strain is a brisk trade detailed by The Globe in which major companies routinely offload properties saddled with hefty cleanup obligations onto smaller players with scant ability to pay for remediation, despite regulations meant to prevent such deals.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This week, Alberta Energy Minister Margaret McCuaig-Boyd said the province is studying a combination of targets and timelines to reduce liabilities[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/canada/article-alberta-vows-to-impose-oil-gas-well-cleanup-timelines-on-energy/] tied to the swollen inventory of inactive sites.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">However, the minister balked at giving the Alberta Energy Regulator (AER) powers to block deals that are structured to bypass rules the regulator introduced to stop financially shaky players from acquiring high-liability wells.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many U.S. states require companies to seek continuing approvals and post security bonds to keep wells inactive. In some cases, they have to show evidence that the wells could be returned to production if commodity prices improve.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Canadian industry has lobbied against mandated cleanup timelines, saying it can’t afford increased costs at a time when even major companies are struggling with rock-bottom prices for heavy crude and natural gas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“You have to understand the crisis that is occurring in the oil and gas sector across Canada right now," said Tristan Goodman, who spent 15 years as an executive with the AER and is now president of the Explorers and Producers Association of Canada, the lobby group for small producers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I think what you don’t want to do is send a whole group of companies into bankruptcy."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Globe found that wells languished even when commodity prices were much higher than today’s levels. Nearly one-fifth of inactive wells in Alberta and roughly 10 per cent each in B.C. and Saskatchewan have been idle for 10 or more years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The AER is encouraging companies to collaborate on cleanup under a new initiative called area-based closure. It involves companies pooling resources to lower costs of cleaning up wells in a given geographic area. However, there are no penalties if companies do not participate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Brad Herald, vice-president of Western Canada operations for the Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers, acknowledged the program lacks teeth. “But it’s set up to achieve a reduction in the provincial inactive liability numbers, which everybody is supportive of," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Saskatchewan Energy Minister Bronwyn Eyre said the province is studying timelines but plans to consult with industry next year as part of a wider policy review that will also examine well transfers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She said that large companies own the vast majority of the nearly 26,000 inactive wells in Saskatchewan. That number has soared 62 per cent since 2005.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Cash-strapped Abbey Resources Corp. had received the ministry’s blessing to acquire 2,345 wells from major companies. It now owes more than $3-million to four municipalities for two years worth of unpaid property taxes and has arbitrarily cut its lease payments to farmers in half.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The province’s orphan well count would balloon – from 516 to nearly 3,000 – should Abbey go under. Ms. Eyre said the ministry is keen to avoid that and is currently examining Abbey’s proposed corporate structure.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Many industry operators have found ways to operate during the downturn,” the Energy Minister said. “And we wouldn’t want the industry to pay a disproportionate share of Abbey’s operating costs, because that has come up as an issue.”</p>

Mr. Grewal brought Yusuf Yenilmez, chief executive of construction firm Zgemi Inc., as a guest on the government’s trip in February.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The federal government is on pace[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/politics/article-ottawa-on-pace-to-spend-400-million-next-year-on-border-crossings/] to spend eight figures over three years, according to a report from the Parliamentary Budget Officer. The average cost for each migrant who entered Canada between border crossings – nearly 38,000 since January of 2017 – is $14,321 for the entire refugee claim process, and the figure is predicted to rise to $16,666 as waiting times in the system get longer. Ottawa spent an estimated $340.2-million last year, $367.8-million in the current fiscal year and a projection of $395.9-million in 2019-20. The PBO figures don’t factor in the costs for provinces; Ontario has said it has spent $200-million to provide assistance on housing and other areas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
John Ibbitson writes[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/politics/article-the-border-just-became-an-election-issue/] : “The problem of people crossing the Canada-U.S. border illegally and then seeking asylum just became a bigger headache for the Liberals, one they emphatically do not need less than a year before the next election.”</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The B.C. Oil and Gas Commission says companies will no longer be able to put off cleanup[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/canada/article-bc-to-put-owners-on-the-clock-for-cleaning-up-idle-oil-and-gas-wells/] indefinitely as it responds to a Globe investigation that detailed the environmental and financial risks of inactive wells. Saskatchewan said it would study the prospect of imposing timelines.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The process of restoring the landscape to its predrilling state can unearth contamination of soil and water and potentially require expensive monitoring and remediation work. Companies have been increasingly putting off the expense, with the number of inactive sites now totalling 122,456 across B.C., Alberta and Saskatchewan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ontario has named veteran police commander Ron Taverner as the new head of the OPP</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Taverner will be in charge[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/canada/article-ontario-names-toronto-police-veteran-ron-taverner-as-chief-of/] of Canada’s second largest police force after the RCMP. Taverner became the unit commander of Toronto’s 23 Division in Etobicoke in the early 2000s, coinciding with the Premier and his brother Rob’s rise to power in the 2000s and 2010s. The Fords found a common cause on their law-and-order crime agenda with Taverner, who through this time was locked in a chronic battle with guns and gangs at 23 Division.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Alok Mukherjee, the former long-serving chair of the Toronto Police Services Board, said despite Taverner’s connections to the Fords, he’ll have to maintain independence in his new role. “Ron [Taverner] has been very close to the <span class="companylink">Ford</span> family.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The federal government says all options are on the table[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/world/article-ottawa-to-send-officials-to-cuba-amid-brain-injury-scare/] as it probes the mysterious “Havana syndrome” injuries of Canadian diplomats and family members. Ottawa isn’t ruling out withdrawing all staff or shutting down the embassy in Havana. Officials also revealed that the number of those affected has increased from 12 to 13, the latest a career diplomat who began reporting symptoms including dizziness and nosebleeds this summer. Despite study from researchers, police and intelligence agencies, no explanation of motive has been found for the attacks. A group of diplomats told The Globe that Ottawa has broken promises to have them all tested and diagnosed in specialized programs.</p>

Ontario saw crimes targeting Muslims soar 207 per cent, while Quebec saw those numbers peak in February of 2017, the month after the mosque shooting in the province’s capital. “This is staggering. You don’t see this kind of increase in any sort of crime data,” said Barbara Perry, an expert on hate crimes and professor of criminology at the University of Ontario Institute of Technology. “It’s an assault on our core values of inclusion and equity.”</p>

The measures[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/politics/article-canada-imposes-sanctions-on-17-saudis-over-killing-of-journalist/] , two weeks after the U.S. imposed comparable sanctions, are the first concrete steps Canada has taken in response to the murder of the dissident journalist. But the federal government continues to leave existing arms sales to the Saudis untouched, and it also hasn’t directly criticized Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. The Crown Prince, who is making a return to the spotlight with an appearance at the G20 summit in Argentina today, is said to have been identified by the CIA as being responsible for Khashoggi’s murder.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">No carbon taxes in Ontario’s new climate plan, but you’re still going to pay</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The PCs have taken the previous government’s carbon plan, removed what was best and amped up what was worst. The best part, a carbon price that left it up to the market to figure out how to lower emissions, is gone. The worst part, a lot of government meddling in business, combined with taxpayer funds for polluters and green initiatives, remains. You can only call this progress if you’re looking at it upside down. The pre-Ford PCs were planning to do the exact opposite. Until less than a year ago, Ontario PCs were promising to keep carbon pricing while getting rid of the slush-fund aspects of it, by returning 100 per cent of money to consumers in the form of lower income taxes. That plan is now, ironically, the Trudeau government’s plan. The Ontario scheme unveiled by Environment Minister Rod Phillips looks nothing like that. But it does lean heavily on the accomplishments of those bad old Liberals.” –  Globe editorial [https://www.theglobeandmail.com/opinion/editorials/article-globe-editorial-no-carbon-taxes-in-ontarios-new-climate-plan-but/]

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“With so much angst about artificial intelligence and the future of work, the recent world chess championship at London’s Chess Classic offers some hope. It is not that mankind has turned the tables on the march of progress. Rather, what is remarkable is what a creative and ultimately human match it was between reigning champion Magnus Carlsen of Norway – the 27-year-old “Mozart of Chess” – and 26-year-old challenger Fabiano Caruana of the United States, a major talent in his own right. At one time, it did seem that computers would sound the death knell for chess, not to mention all human mind games. That was certainly my guess in the late 1970s, when the rise of computers was one of the main reasons I gave for retiring from competitive chess.” –  Kenneth Rogoff [https://www.theglobeandmail.com/opinion/article-a-bolt-from-deep-blue-why-human-chess-survives-in-the-face-of-ai/] , professor of economics and public policy at Harvard University</p>

<span class="companylink">Exxon</span>, <span class="companylink">Mobil</span> merge in record US$81-billion deal</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nov. 30, 1999: The merger of <span class="companylink">Exxon Corp</span>. and <span class="companylink">Mobil Corp</span>. marked a partial joining together of what U.S. president Teddy Roosevelt’s trustbusters had torn asunder 88 years earlier. <span class="companylink">Exxon</span> was the largest of the seven descendants of John D. Rockefeller’s Standard Oil Co., which dominated oil production, refining and marketing in the United States in the late-19th and early-20th century. Roosevelt used the Sherman Anti-Trust Act to break up Standard Oil in 1911. Standard Oil of New Jersey took 50 per cent of the assets and became <span class="companylink">Exxon Corp</span>., while Standard Oil of New York morphed into Mobil Oil Corp. In the late 1990s, global oil prices slumped badly, hitting a low of US$9.39 a barrel in December, 1998. The resulting low share prices meant companies could purchase oil production more cheaply than drilling for it, and sparked a spate of mergers. <span class="companylink">Exxon</span> essentially acquired <span class="companylink">Mobil</span> in a deal worth US$81-billion, then the largest corporate deal in history. Then-Exxon chairman Lee Raymond defended the merger as a necessary step to keep the leading U.S. oil company competitive with giant state-owned or state-backed firms in <span class="companylink">OPEC</span> and Russia – a far cry from the time when Standard Oil operated virtually without rivals. – Shawn McCarthy</p>

Other sectors should follow before it's too late</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Used to hearing greenhouse gas pricing programs described as a “job-killing carbon tax"? Then it might surprise you to discover that the Business Council of Canada, whose members provide almost two million Canadians with jobs, was unqualified in its support for the federal government's carbon price backstop when it was unveiled in October.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“For many years," the council announced in a press release, “we have advocated for carbon pricing as the most efficient means to contribute to achieving Canada's climate change goals."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Like many supporters of carbon pricing, the Business Council doesn't pick a favourite between the two most common approaches in Canada—a straight carbon tax like British Columbia's, which levies a flat rate by the tonne to all carbon dioxide emissions; or a cap-and-trade system like the one Quebec has joined. The Business Council simply accepts the argument made by many energy economists that putting a price on carbon is the most efficient first step in reducing emissions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This enthusiastic support for carbon pricing—and action on climate change in general—echoes that of the business sector most often targeted by environmentalists as the country's greatest climate villain: the oil sands industry. Indeed, the Business Council's endorsement was a bit tepid by comparison.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Perhaps in part because they have been targets in the climate change debate for so long, oil sands executives have become some of the most vehement business voices in favour of emissions-reducing mechanisms such as carbon pricing. CEOs from several major oil sands producers crowded the podium in Edmonton back in 2015 when Alberta Premier Rachel Notley rolled out her carbon-pricing climate plan. At the biannual Globe conference in Vancouver—among the biggest events on the calendar for Canada's growing cleantech sector—oil sands execs are as common a sight as electric cars on the trade show floor; this year's instalment of the conference featured Shell Canada country chair Michael Crothers on the marquee opening panel, discussing clean energy policy alongside green power advocates and climate scientists.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Suncor CEO Steve Williams, meanwhile, has emerged as one of the most ardent critics of climate-policy footdragging you'll find anywhere.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“It is a matter of profound disappointment to me," Williams told a Calgary crowd recently, “that science and economics have taken on some strange political ownership—why the science of the left wing is different than the science of the right wing." You could be forgiven for thinking he was directing his ire at opponents of his industry, but his actual target was the political right and its refusal to give a fair hearing to economists arguing that carbon pricing represents the most efficient way to take action. It was, in essence, an established oil sands CEO dressing down his most vocal boosters—telling them it's time to get with the program on climate change.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This is where a decade at the roiling centre of the global debate about climate change has brought Canada's oil sands industry. It might be tempting to dismiss it all as a cynical airbrushing of the industry's corporate image while the oil patch continues to reap profits from pushing Canada's emissions steadily higher—and certainly there's some of that going on.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">(Oil sands emissions are up from 8% to 9% of Canada's total since 2009, although emissions per barrel are down by more than 20%.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But there's a deeper lesson here—one that the oil sands learned the hard way, by spending more than a decade as an international symbol of environmental destruction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And it's a lesson that every executive boardroom in Canada would do well to heed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That lesson is that climate change is not another environmental issue alongside the rest.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is an emerging catastrophe affecting every aspect of human society—which by extension will have consequences for nearly every business in any sector. Climate change won't be contained, and it's no longer enough to delegate it to the corporate social responsibility department or give it passing lip service in a sustainability report. It's a C-suite issue, a bottom-line question. Those businesses it hasn't hit yet should count themselves lucky—there's still a chance to get out ahead of the issue before they wind up, as the oil sands has, the subject of damning headlines.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This is a lesson that extends far beyond public image. Oil sands companies have embraced the need to act on climate change not because it might make them look better, but because the risk of not acting has proven to be so great—a fact made clear to the industry almost daily since the name “Keystone XL" first hit the international political radar. Oil sands companies know they have no viable future unless they can find a way to be welcome and profitable in a low-carbon economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The other critical lesson oil sands companies have learned is that there is opportunity in taking action. For many, this has meant obsessive efficiency improvements. By consuming less fossil fuel in the digging and processing of bitumen, they have cut costs and boosted profits, even as they've shrunk the carbon footprint of each barrel of oil. It's mainly a question of competitiveness, but also an opportunity to develop pollution-reducing technologies that may one day be of enormous value in the marketplace. For the business world beyond the oil sands, the opportunities are even greater. Building the infrastructure of a low-carbon world is already a multitrilliondollar project, and it is growing bigger all the time. The rest of this century belongs to the companies—and economies—that corner this market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It still might be possible to mint political capital by fearmongering about the cost of taking climate change action, but there's less financial capital to be made every day. The smart money's in embracing it—just ask an oil sands executive.</p>

NEIL BRUCE TOOK <span class="companylink">SNC-LAVALIN</span> FROM SCANDAL-RIDDEN TO WORLD CLASS. EVERYTHING WAS GOING GREAT—UNTIL A FEW MONTHS AGO. WILL THE COMPANY HE WORKED SO HARD TO REBUILD CRUMBLE?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">BRUCE NEIL saw his luck run out at precisely 9:46 a.m., Ottawa time, on Aug. 2, when Foreign Affairs Minister Chrystia Freeland published her now-famous tweet about Saudi Arabia.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The tweet seemed innocent enough. Freeland “strongly" called for the release of detained Saudi dissidents Raif and Samar Badawi. But the Saudi regime went ballistic at what it viewed as Canadian interference in its domestic affairs. The Canadian ambassador in Riyadh was kicked out, and thousands of Saudi students were ordered to leave Canada. Saudi Arabia froze all new trade with Canada and instructed its investment arms to unload Canadian holdings at any price.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Until then, Bruce had been on a terrific run at Montreal-based engineering and construction giant <span class="companylink">SNC-Lavalin</span>. The Scotsman had spent the past three years tweaking, buying, selling, hiring, firing and refocusing in the wake of its debilitating corruption scandal. Investors loved his work—until Freeland's tweet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While many diplomats assumed the Saudis regarded Canada as a “soft target," meaning they could make an example of Canada without inflicting much damage on the Saudi economy, the incident nonetheless triggered spasms of anxiety within SNC, a feeling reinforced by a sharp fall in the share price. Saudi Arabia accounted for 11% of SNC's revenues and had been a big growth area. The company had 9,100 employees in Saudi Arabia and had been a corporate fixture in the country for 50 years. <span class="companylink">Saudi Aramco</span>, the world's biggest oil company, was among its clients.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This was one market SNC could not afford to lose, and Canada was isolated. No other country was coming out in support of Freeland's stance.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The Saudis threatened to stop working with any Canadian company," Bruce said in late September, over lunch in London.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“It provided a whole bunch of instability. It's ongoing, it's not resolved. We're trying to work our way through it with the clients and hoping they don't say, ‘We don't want to work with you.' " But only two weeks after that interview, another incident displaced Saudi Arabia as SNC's top problem.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Canada, SNC failed to secure a deferred prosecution agreement (DPA), a negotiated settlement used in some other G7 countries that likely would have seen criminal charges against the company stayed in exchange for fines and a demonstrated commitment to toughen up ethics and compliance standards. Bruce was shocked. He had been optimistic a DPA would land on his lap, capping a magical turnaround story.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With no DPA, SNC faces a criminal trial that could thrust it into legal uncertainty for years; a conviction could severely damage, even kill, SNC's ability to win government contracts in Canada for up to 10 years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The DPA letdown marked Bruce's first significant defeat at SNC. Until then, his strategic overhaul of the company had gone admirably well, thrusting it into the top ranks of the global engineering and construction (E&C) industry after making two big acquisitions, ditching workaday businesses and recruiting a team of international executives determined to play in the big leagues.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SNC was landing big-name projects, including the REM, an electric light-rail project for greater Montreal; the decommissioning of the Saskatchewan Research Council's Slowpoke-2 nuclear reactor; and full engineering services for one of the world's largest sulphuric acid plants, in Saudi Arabia.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Before learning on Oct. 10 that the DPA would go missing, Bruce said he wanted to push SNC all the way to the top: “I think Canada having a global champion—No. 1—is possible."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now, you can't help but wonder: Has Bruce built up SNC only to have to tear it down again?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">ON A WARM DAY in April 2012, in a chaotic suburb of Tunis, my Arabic interpreter and I banged on the door of a small, modern office that housed Orbit Media and asked to see Baya Ben Aïssa. We were led to a desk where a petite woman in her 70s identified herself as Orbit's owner and confirmed she was the mother of Riadh Ben Aïssa.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We—a small team of journalists at The Globe and Mail—had been trying to find Riadh Ben Aïssa for weeks and had no idea whether he was in his native Tunisia, in Canada or somewhere in between. What we did know was that he was at the centre of a corruption scandal that would bludgeon SNC, one of the country's few corporate flag-bearers overseas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A couple of months earlier, Ben Aïssa, who was SNC's global construction chief and, apparently, North Africa and Middle East fixer extraordinaire, had been drummed out of SNC, accused of making $56 million in payments to unknown commercial agents to help win contracts. Libyan strongman Moammar Gadhafi was among his clients, and SNC was building Gadhafi a 4,000-inmate prison just as the Libyan revolution erupted. That cozy relationship ended in October 2011, when Gadhafi was hauled out of a drainage pipe and assassinated.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Earlier in the day, we had found Ben Aïssa's expansive villa in the wealthy suburb of Carthage, just beyond Tunis, but the armed guards at both ends of the street prevented us from making a gracious visit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Later, at Orbit, which sold computers and other office items and which shared the same address as SNC's Tunisian office, Baya grew suspicious when we asked about her relationship with SNC and the whereabouts of her son. Standing erect and crossing her arms, she said, “I don't work for SNC anymore." As for her son, “There are false rumours in the Canadian press about him. Very false."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A couple of heavy-duty men invited us to hit the road.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ben Aïssa, as it turned out, was not in Tunisia. Unbeknownst to us, he'd been detained by Swiss police not long before I arrived in Tunis. He was later extradited to Canada, where he would face a criminal trial. In July, fully six years later, he pleaded guilty to one charge of using forged documents related to the infamous McGill University Health Centre (MUHC) bid-rigging scandal, one of the biggest fraud cases in Canadian history.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The case centred on an alleged $22.5-million payment from SNC to a Bahamas company called Sierra Asset Management.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Quebec investigators alleged that Ben Aïssa and Pierre Duhaime, who was SNC's CEO when the corruption scandals erupted, were behind the secret payments to secure the $1.3-billion contract to build the MUHC. Payments were allegedly received by Arthur Porter, the late CEO of the MUHC.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some 15 other charges against Ben Aïssa were dropped. Since he had already spent 29 months in prison and more than three years wearing a tracking device, he was released. Next in the dock is Duhaime, whose trial is set to begin in January.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But SNC itself wasn't off the hook. In 2015, the RCMP charged SNC with fraud and corruption related to an alleged $48 million in bribes paid to Libyan officials (among them one of Gadhafi's sons) and defrauding various Libyan organizations of $130 million. Two years earlier, the <span class="companylink">World Bank</span> had banned <span class="companylink">SNC-Lavalin Inc</span>. and its affiliates from taking part in <span class="companylink">World Bank</span>–financed contracts for up to 10 years because of “misconduct"—conspiracy to pay bribes—related to the multibillion-dollar contract to build the Padma Bridge in Bangladesh.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">None of these scandals happened under Bruce's watch, but they would stalk him as he was trying to reinvent Canada's premier E&C company.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
NEIL BRUCE IS VIRTUALLY UNKNOWN outside of the E&C industry, where he is very well known.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Among average Canadians, even among senior executives, he is a low-profile boss, partly by choice—he is intensely private and avoids social media—and partly because he is a foreigner who is not part of the Toronto corporate power base, which considers Montreal an outpost. Born in Scotland, he joined SNC in 2013 as president of its resources, environment and water group. He is an outsider and seems entirely comfortable in that role.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I met Bruce for the first time in late September near Piccadilly, in the heart of London, at Mash, an American-style steak restaurant with an elegant Art Deco interior—my choice. The place was perfect for a long chat over lunch: It's never overwhelmed by midday crowds, it's tucked in the bowels of a sturdy old building on Brewer Street, away from the street noise, and the waiters are pleasantly unchatty.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bruce could pass for an aging Marine or SAS officer, with his close-cropped, pepper-grey hair—almost a buzz cut—stout physique and lively blue-grey eyes. At 58, he still looks like he could casually knock the next guy's lights out in a pub brawl. But on that day, he was not guzzling anything but sparkling water. He ordered the sea bream, never mind that this was a steak joint.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bruce doesn't dress like a CEO. He almost never wears a tie, but arrived at lunch in a crisp white shirt and restrained grey suit that whispered middle management. He was still obviously Scottish—the pitch of his vowels was unmistakably so—even though he has spent most of his career outside of Scotland. He said “whilst," not “while," and “goot" instead of “good."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He reinforces the cliché that Scots are tightwads. There are no company cars or jets even though SNC has operations in more than 50 countries. Ian Edwards, the Brit who is president of SNC's infrastructure sector—the Bruce era has seen an influx of Brits—says the boss takes a dim view of executives who run fat expense accounts. “If we go for dinner as a group, it's never extravagant," Edwards says. “We would never order expensive wine."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Bruce does have his extravagances. He's a Formula 1 nut and adores the <span class="companylink">McLaren Racing</span> team. At times, he has owned expensive sports cars, including a classic Ferrari 328, a Porsche 911 and three <span class="companylink">BMW</span> M5s. Today, he drives a Range Rover SUV because he and his English partner, Emma, an investment banker, have a seven-year-old daughter, Daisy, who needs ferrying around Montreal and to the ski slopes. While they consider Montreal their home, they keep a house near Henley-on-Thames in south Oxfordshire, west of London.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The three sector presidents I interviewed all had similar views of Bruce: He's refreshingly direct and transparent, has no big ego, is a strategic thinker, isn't chatty—you have to read his facial expressions for clues of approval or disapproval—lacks the control-freak gene and gives his executives ample autonomy, offering “gentle oversight," as one of them puts it. “He's the best strategic thinker I have ever seen," says Christian Brown, the East Yorkshireman who is president of SNC's oil and gas business.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“He's probably the best boss I have ever worked for."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Edwards says Bruce is a bit of a loner; he tends not to engage closely with his lieutenants when making big decisions until it's really necessary. “I believe this is part of his approach to empower and enable this team to focus while he gets on with his own job of running the company," Edwards says. “The biggest thing he did was empower management."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bruce had a happy childhood that was marred by one tragedy: the death of his mother, Margaret, from a blood disorder when he was in his early teens. At the time, the Bruce family was living just south of Aberdeen, the grey-granite port city in northeast Scotland that would grow wealthy after the North Sea turned into an oil gusher in the 1970s. Bruce's father, Graeme, now in his late 70s, was a factory engineer and transformed himself into a United Free Church of Scotland minister just before his wife's death. “Our parents taught us all the basics," Bruce says. “It was about education, integrity, fairness, how to treat people."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">His first job was at <span class="companylink">Brown & Root</span>, an industrial services company, where he worked on offshore oil projects. His career highlights include the oil company <span class="companylink">Atlantic Richfield</span>, where he was construction director, and Amec (now <span class="companylink">Amec Foster Wheeler</span>), a British project engineering company, where he was responsible for the resources division, including its work in the Alberta oil sands. As Amec's chief operating officer and executive director between 2009 and 2012, he pretty much ran the show, and that distinction landed him in trouble with the then CEO, Samir Brikho.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After 14 years, he resigned. Then a storied but disgraced Canadian E&C company called <span class="companylink">SNC-Lavalin</span>, born in 1911 and associated with some of Canada's most famous engineering projects, including the James Bay hydroelectric system, came knocking.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By then, Duhaime had been tossed, and SNC was being run by Robert Card, a hard-ass American civil and environmental engineer who had served as deputy undersecretary of energy in the early years of the George W. Bush presidency. Card had been charged with the ruthless revamp of SNC's ethics and compliance standards and swept the broom through the management suite (some 10,000 Canadian employees left SNC during the crisis years, most voluntarily, due to the cloud of uncertainty hanging over the company).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SNC needed to recruit an executive or two with the potential to replace Card when he finished his cleanup.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At first, Bruce thought: “You've got to be kidding.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SNC has all blown up. Why would I want to join a French-Canadian company with ethics and compliance issues?" Curiosity got the better of him, and he soon figured out that while SNC had a dire reputation problem, it was no financial basket case. That meant the company would not require a full-scale rescue mission, even if it needed a major tune-up. “When you have a company that needs a turnaround, it normally has a weak balance sheet, but that wasn't the issue at SNC," he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“SNC was a combination of a decent balance sheet and a very loyal shareholder base, like the Caisse [de dépôt et placement du Québec], that wanted to see the company survive and come out the other end."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He joined SNC in 2013 and went on the strategic offensive while Card, as CEO, played defence with a top-to-bottom ethics and compliance fix-it job, which included banning the company from doing business in countries that occupied the bottom ranks of <span class="companylink">Transparency International</span>'s corruption rankings and banning the use of agents except in countries where they were legally required. Agents are typically local “business partners" who take payments to help secure contracts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the global contracting world, it is widely known that these payments can in effect be bribes. “There's 10 times as much work we can do with great customers, with clean customers, in areas of the world where we don't have to get involved in bribery," Bruce says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bruce's strategic assessment was that SNC was toiling away in a few businesses it shouldn't be and was largely absent from one business where it should, which was oil and gas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bruce also determined that SNC relied too heavily on two sectors—infrastructure and mining—the latter always risky because it's a feast-or-famine industry.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Within infrastructure, he figured SNC was wasting its time on civil contracts, such as engineering-lite office buildings and hospitals, where it had no competitive edge and lousy margins, and was competing with efficient construction companies. The civil business was wound down, and three other businesses that weren't making much money and never would—building management services, French construction engineering and thermal power—were either sold or are being wound down.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bruce decided that SNC should concentrate on big, long-life, complex projects, such as rail systems, where it could leverage its engineering expertise, faced fewer competitors and, in some cases, could take a piece of the action, as it did with Ontario's enormously profitable Highway 407 toll road, which is 17% owned by SNC (a stake that will soon be sold down to 10% as part of a balance sheet health upgrade). “We can design them, build them and operate them," he says, describing the ideal SNC project.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To fill the oil and gas hole, in 2014 he bought Kentz, an Irish-born oil and gas and petrochemicals engineering group that was listed on the <span class="companylink">London Stock Exchange</span>, for $2.1 billion. Kentz boosted employment in SNC's oil and gas division from about 3,000 to 20,000, making it the company's biggest business and giving it a competitive edge in energy projects around the world.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The biggie came two years later, when Bruce paid $3.5 billion for <span class="companylink">WS Atkins</span>, Britain's top engineering consultancy and one of the world's leading design and project engineering businesses. In its fiscal year, Atkins had revenues of £1.86 billion (about $3 billion) and some 18,000 employees in more than three dozen countries, making it about half the size of SNC at the time. Among Atkins's notable projects were the engineering design for the London 2012 Olympics, the architectural design for <span class="companylink">Royal Caribbean</span>'s monster Oasis of the Seas cruise ship, and construction management for the overhaul of the Statue of Liberty site.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For Bruce, Atkins's real attraction was its nuclear power plant decommissioning business, whose work in the United States and Europe was thriving as old plants were dismantled.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Atkins nuclear unit fit well with SNC's own nuclear business, which was also involved in decommissioning work as well as reactor upgrades for the <span class="companylink">Bruce Power</span> and <span class="companylink">Ontario Power Generation</span> reactors (SNC owns the licence for the Canadiandeveloped Candu reactor technology). Bruce says SNC's nuclear division, with Atkins in the family fold, accounts for about 10% of the company's business and could easily double in the next decade. “Nuclear for us is fantastic," he says. “Today, we're sitting on a nuclear business that is truly world class."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With Kentz and Atkins tucked into the portfolio and the lowmargin businesses shunted out the door, by 2017 SNC was putting a smile on Bruce's face—a relatively rare phenomenon. As a bonus, the company would soon settle a $1-billion class-action lawsuit related to corruption allegations in Libya, for a deep-discount $88 million. Even the threat of a criminal trial seemed to be on the wane as Canada signalled it would bring in DPA legislation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Under Bruce, SNC had essentially become a new company. The top management had been entirely replaced, as had the board of directors. Bruce had reshaped its business, giving it international bulk in six areas: oil and gas; engineering, design and project management; infrastructure; nuclear; clean power (including renewable energy); and mining, which started coming out of a cyclical slump last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Analysts were getting the message that SNC had been reinvented, and the “buy" recommendations reappeared. When Bruce went from chief operating officer to CEO in October 2015, the shares were trading at about $40. By mid-2017, they were above $55, and halfway through 2018, they breached $60, valuing the company at almost $11 billion. In the 2017 fiscal year, the company reported $382 million in net income attributable to shareholders, up 50% over the previous year, on revenue of $9.3 billion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The order backlog stood at an impressive $10.4 billion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When Bruce took over SNC, the company had 35,000 employees. By the end of 2017, it had 52,000 (that number is unchanged today). SNC had become a big, profitable company that was going places, and employee morale began to improve, not just because the crisis years were fading from view, but because, under Bruce, the pressure from the ethics and compliance clampdown unleashed by Card began to ease off.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Marie-Claude Dumas, president of the clean power sector, joined SNC in 2006 and is one of the few senior executives to have survived the upheaval under Card and Bruce. She says there's no comparing the old, pre-crisis SNC and the new one.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She describes SNC under Duhaime, who spent 20 years at SNC before being named CEO in 2009, as “extremely decentralized," implying that it was run like a collection of fiefdoms.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Every project manager was like a king or queen, and they were free to do their jobs as they saw fit," says Dumas. “When he arrived, Bob Card was in crisis management mode, and his focus was on putting in place a first-tier ethics and compliance program. The program was strict. You couldn't even take a client out for a coffee without permission."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dumas was happy when Bruce took over the show. “When he came on board, he was able to bring the pendulum back a bit," she says. “It's a relief to be a normal company again, focusing on the business and clients." As for Bruce as a manager, she says, “he's very transparent. He's a great boss, and he believes in his people."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So far, so good. The Bruce era was paying dividends. The winddown of austerity in Europe and Donald Trump's promises to repair clapped-out bridges, roads and ports meant infrastructure spending had nowhere to go but up. Commodity prices were rising, allowing finance bosses to crack open mining and energy development budgets. With all the baddies vanquished from SNC, the corruption crisis was fading and the final cleansing event—the DPA—seemed to be on its way. What could go wrong?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">THE MISSING DPA ENRAGED BRUCE. He had been optimistic that an agreement protecting the company from a criminal trial was in the bag, all the more so since the federal government had introduced legislation to allow such agreements just a few months earlier. DPAs are used in the United States, Britain and other countries in the belief that it's often unfair to punish a company and its employees as a whole if the wrongdoing was the handiwork of a few executives or employees.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SNC shares plunged 14% on Oct. 10, the day the company disclosed that no DPA was coming. The following week, Bruce took out full-page ads in leading newspapers to appeal to Canadians for support in the hope of getting the agreement back on the table.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The debate is about what is right for this country," he wrote, a subtle hint that going after SNC itself, as opposed to the individual sleazoids responsible for the corruption, would risk 9,000 Canadian jobs and perhaps even the Montreal head office, if the sagging share price were to lure bargain-hunting takeover artists.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, Bruce was praying for the best in Saudi Arabia.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After Freeland's tweet, SNC's bidding on a few Saudi contracts in mining, oil and gas, and infrastructure was “put on hold," he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But nothing truly devastating happened and, after the murder of Saudi dissident journalist Jamal Khashoggi on Oct. 2 in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul, it was Saudi Arabia's turn to be isolated. The whole world was critical of the kingdom, not just Canada. At that point, the Saudis seemed to have more important things to do than beat up on Canadian diplomats and companies. By the start of November, SNC had not lost any business in Saudi Arabia and actually managed to marginally boost its Saudi employment, which includes more than 1,400 Saudi nationals.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As of late October, Bruce said the company's business “seems to be carrying on as normal." Whether back-corridor SNC diplomacy managed to stabilize the situation or whether the Saudis were still plotting ways to make life difficult for Canadian companies in Saudi Arabia was not known.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But now, with a looming corruption trial hanging over SNC, Bruce has to be wondering whether the restructuring he has directed for three years will need to be followed by another restructuring—this one designed to prevent equity value from vanishing as the threat of a criminal conviction hangs over the company like the Sword of Damocles. “We do have a Plan B in the works," he told me after finding out about the DPA. “We have to protect shareholder value. We have various options."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And what would Plan B look like? He wouldn't say, but he didn't deny a Desjardins Capital Markets report that it might include selling the core E&C business in whole or in part; privatizing the company, perhaps with a strategic partner such as a pension fund; or winding down the Canadian operations, which might suffer greatly if any conviction were to land SNC on the federal government's blacklist of contractors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Here he was, he said, a Scotsman who had lived in Canada for only three years, suddenly “fighting to maintain a Canadian icon." SNC has asked for a judicial review of the Public Prosecution Service's decision, arguing that the service gave SNC no explanation for the rejection and warning that the looming corruption trial would have “extremely negative consequences" on “innocent" employees, investors, suppliers and pensioners. He is evidently playing a political game, gambling that the service would revive the DPA if SNC, without a DPA, faced serious damage.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Indeed, Desjardins analysts in Montreal say SNC's battered share price might make the company a sitting duck. “We believe that SNC could be an attractive takeover target if its valuation remains depressed," they said in their Oct. 17 report. Bruce confirmed he has revived the restructuring team he'd formed in 2015.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Before the DPA bomb hit, Bruce said his overhaul of SNC was ahead of schedule and largely successful.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The work around the initial five-year plan is pretty much done," he told me. “The next bit is for the company to get real organic growth."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now, all bets are off. Bruce wanted to be the boss who transformed SNC from national embarrassment to Canadian corporate champion, and the Scotsman almost did it. While he could still achieve his goal—securing a DPA is not out of the question, even if it seems unlikely in the near term—the legacy of certain individuals' reckless behaviour in Libya and Montreal almost a decade ago has ruined his fantasy. Riadh Ben Aïssa, set free, is no doubt a happy man. Neil Bruce is just angry.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">How can Justin Trudeau reconcile fighting climate change and promoting massive new fossil fuel projects? He can't</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the climate change hypocrisy sweepstakes, it's hard to beat Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. But he sure talks a good game.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Climate change is a clear and present danger, he says. Left unchecked, it will have dire consequences for the environment, the global economy and humanity itself. In late 2015, just before he enthusiastically endorsed the Paris climate change accord, Trudeau said: “The atmosphere doesn't care where carbon is emitted. It requires us to take action all around the world."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In came plans for a carbon tax, which is now being imposed on any province without its own emissions pricing. The tax will start next year at $20 for every tonne of greenhouse gas emissions and will raise fuel prices, but it is designed to be revenue neutral. Canadians will receive rebates (the average Ontario family would get about $300 a year). So far, so good. But now look at what's happening.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Less than a year after Canada endorsed the Paris deal, the federal government approved <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span>'s Trans Mountain pipeline expansion. The pipeline connects Alberta to the British Columbia coast and would give the oil sands, one of the world's most carbon-intensive energy projects, a vast new market in Asia.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last spring, when a regulatory war between Alberta and B.C. put the pipeline into deep-freeze, <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span> abandoned the project. To keep it alive, the Trudeau Liberals spent $4.5 billion of taxpayers' money to nationalize it. They also approved the Enbridge Line 3 crude oil pipeline, from Alberta to Wisconsin. “I've said many times that there isn't a country in the world that would find billions of barrels of oil and leave it in the ground while there is a market for it," Trudeau said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In yet another Jekyll-and-Hyde moment in Trudeau's initiatives on the climate file, he came out in support of the $40-billion LNG Canada project in October. Owned by a consortium of oil and gas companies led by <span class="companylink">Royal Dutch Shell</span>, the project will take gas from the Montney fields on the Alberta–B.C. border and send it by pipeline to a terminal near Kitimat, B.C., where it will be turned into liquefied natural gas (LNG) and shipped to Asia.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">LNG Canada is a carbon hog. It is also incompatible with B.C.'s carbon-reduction targets and Canada's ostensible enthusiasm to meet the Paris agreement objectives, which seek to limit average global temperature increases to 1.5 C over pre-industrial levels.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Thanks to a carbon tax that is held up as a worldwide gold standard, B.C. was making credible progress in reducing emissions from all sources. In 2015, emissions were equivalent to 61.6 million tonnes of carbon dioxide, down 4.7% from the 2007 baseline year, even during robust economic growth. The province's emissions targets were set to fall rapidly to 39 million tonnes in 2030, 26 million tonnes in 2040 and 13 million tonnes a decade later.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">LNG Canada's domestic emissions, at best, threaten to make those targets much more difficult to meet. At worst, they will blow the province's entire carbon budget. Marc Lee, a senior economist at the <span class="companylink">Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives</span>, delivered a submission to the B.C. government in August that calculated that the emissions from LNG Canada's first phase alone would range from nine million to 12 million tonnes of carbon dioxide a year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That's about double the emissions of B.C.'s entire existing oil and gas industry.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">LNG Canada says the annual emissions would be 3.5 million tonnes. But the figure apparently assumes the production of hydro power from a massive legally contested dam that has yet to be built.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Using Lee's figure, LNG Canada alone would consume between 23% and 31% of B.C.'s allowable emissions by 2030, rising to between 69% and 92% by 2050. For LNG Canada (and other new LNG plants) to operate at full capacity, everyone else in B.C. would have to reduce emissions drastically. But who? Is the government going to buy every driver an electric car? The LNG Canada figures, by the way, exclude emissions from burning the fuel in Asia. Add those to the B.C. emissions, and the total would reach 93 million tonnes of planet-warming CO2 a year when the project reaches capacity, Lee says. The project's backers, including the Trudeau government, argue that the LNG would displace coal in China. That's a big assumption. The LNG might fill new energy demand or even displace clean energy sources such as solar power.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When then prime minister Stephen Harper yanked Canada from the Kyoto climate accord in 2011, environmentalists labelled him a fossil. Perhaps, but he wasn't a hypocrite. He knew Canada had zero chance of meeting carbon-reduction targets as long as it remained a resources-based economy, and he was right.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Trudeau is promising a greener future, but his enthusiasm for carbon-intensive projects belies that image. Canada is still part of the global warming problem.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ontario will scale back its climate-change targets and focus on regulating industrial greenhouse gas emitters, the province said Thursday as the government unveiled its environmental plan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The new strategy will make it harder for Canada to meet commitments made under the Paris climate accord. The federal government was relying on Ontario's more aggressive approach under the former Liberal provincial government, which implemented a cap-and-trade system.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ontario Environment Minister Rod Phillips announced the province would create regulations for industrial emitters, support business investment in innovation and clean technology, and increase the ethanol content for gasoline to 15 per cent from 10 per cent by 2025.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He said the government would consult with industry before determining how the regulation system would work, the degree to which individual facilities would have to reduce emissions and what kind of enforcement mechanism would be used to ensure compliance.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Premier Doug Ford continues to battle Prime Minister Justin Trudeau over the federal carbon tax that will commence next April in provinces that do not have a broad-based levy that meets Ottawa's standards. With an election scheduled for next fall, the Trudeau government is seeking to ease the burden on consumers by sending out rebate cheques next spring for anticipated 2019 costs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Phillips said Ontario aims to reduce emissions by 30 per cent below 2005 levels by 2030, which is the same target adopted by Ottawa for the country as a whole under the 2015 Paris agreement.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But it is far less ambitious than the goal set by the former Liberal government under Kathleen Wynne.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“This target takes into consideration the commitment the people of Ontario have already shown in reducing emissions, as well as our commitment to growing Ontario's economy while doing our part to tackle climate change," Mr. Phillips told a news conference at the Cold Creek Conservation Area in Nobleton, north of Toronto.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The province is already three-quarters of the way to hitting that goal, largely as the result of the closing of coal-fired power plants. Mr. Phillips said Ontario has already made considerable progress in reducing greenhouse gas emissions, and households and business have paid a substantial price in doing so.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nationally, Canada faces an uphill battle to meet its targets as emissions in Alberta and Saskatchewan have soared since 2005 and are still rising. The Trudeau government had been counting on more ambitious efforts by Ontario, Quebec and British Columbia to make up for slower progress in the two prairie provinces that rely heavily on oil and gas production and coal-fired electricity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Ontario, the former Liberal government committed the province to reducing greenhouse gases by 37 per cent below 1990 levels by 2030. The difference between the Progressive Conservative 2030 target and the former Liberal one is 30megatonnes, an amount equivalent to the emissions in Nova Scotia and New Brunswick combined.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“It is absolutely true that Kathleen Wynne's targets were greater than our targets," Mr. Phillips said. “It's also true that she was going to be charging Ontarians $2-billion a year in a carbon tax, and it's also true that many many observers thought that there was no way she was going to reach those targets."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The previous government had adopted a cap-and-trade system that set limits on emissions and required companies to purchase emission allowances, either from the province itself or from California and Quebec. It was spending the proceeds of that cap-and-trade auctions on a number of energy-efficiency and low-carbon initiatives for homeowners, schools, municipalities and businesses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Federal Environment Minister Catherine McKenna said the Ontario government is taking a step backward in Canada's battle to reduce emissions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“It's really disappointing to see Premier Ford undo Ontario's climate action progress," she said. “Any serious climate plan includes a price on pollution. When pollution is free, there will be more of it."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The emissions plan is part of broader environmental strategy that Mr. Phillips unveiled Thursday. While promising vigilance on water and air pollution, it also features a series of measures to help the province adapt to a changing climate and extreme weather events, including a provincewide assessment of the risks posed to communities, critical infrastructure, the economy and the environment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While key details are not yet known, Ontario's proposed regulations on large emitters appears to resemble similar efforts from Saskatchewan and even the federal government. In order to protect industrial competitiveness, the regulations aim to provide incentives for large companies to cut their greenhouse gas emissions without taxing the total amount of greenhouse gases produced.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The federal government has agreed to recognize Saskatchewan's regulations rather than impose its own.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A crisis in Alberta's oilpatch has two industry heavyweights - <span class="companylink">Suncor Energy Inc</span>. and <span class="companylink">Cenovus Energy Inc</span>. - slugging it out over how best to fix Canada's oil industry. Funny thing, just a few years ago they were in the same corner boasting how they'd just solved all their future problems together. What went wrong? Due to Canada's woefully inadequate pipeline capacity, the gap between the price fetched by Alberta and the world benchmark price has recently been hitting record highs, growing to nearly US$50 a barrel. Alberta Premier Rachel Notley claims the situation is costing the country $80 million per day.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Notley recently appointed a three-person panel to come up with short-term solutions to this long-term problem. Notable among them is a plan floated by Cenovus CEO Alex Pourbaix for a government-mandated provincewide production cut. Citing a "full-blown economic crisis," Cenovus wants Notley to impose oil quotas on producers to eliminate the supply glut and give prices a boost.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Suncor doesn't agree.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Our position is that government intervention in the market sends the wrong signal," a spokesperson told Financial Post. While upstream producers such as Cenovus have been taking it on the chin, large integrated oil companies like Suncor are less affected by the price gap: Suncor pumps oil, then refines it in Canada and retails the gas at its Petro-Canada outlets. Not only is the firm less tied to export markets, it essentially sells the discounted oil to itself as an input, and then markets the output to consumers at full price. Cha-ching! On the immediate question of which firm is right about how to handle the price gap, the evidence favours Suncor. Cenovus has already cut production based on the assumption it's better to leave a valuablebut-underpriced product in the ground until it earns a better return. This is a rational market-based response open to any company. But forcing quotas on all firms is not in the best interests of the industry. Supply management inevitably turns entrepreneurs into supplicants for government favours and tireless defenders of the status quo.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Plus, the precedent Cenovus invokes for this plan - former Alberta premier Peter Lougheed's famous gambit to "turn off the taps" to Eastern Canada during his battle with the federal government over the national energy program - is an inappropriate comparison. In 1980, the motivation was to impose political pain elsewhere in response to bad policy choices in Ottawa. Today, the intent is to mitigate economic pain by imposing bad policies at home.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Regardless of whether Cenovus or Suncor is right, however, there's a bigger truth to be revealed regarding their joint culpability in creating this unhappy situation in the first place. Exactly three years ago, Cenovus and Suncor both pledged their fealty to the same risky political gamble in hopes of avoiding the kind of crisis now visited upon Alberta.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the end of November 2015, the CEOs of Suncor and Cenovus stood with their colleagues from <span class="companylink">Shell Canada</span> and <span class="companylink">Canadian Natural Resources Ltd</span>. along with representatives from four major environmental organizations, as Notley unveiled her province's new climate change policy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Notley's plan included a phase-out of coal power, a hard cap on emissions for the entire oilsands, and a new economywide carbon tax. In exchange for supporting this new policy, the four assembled oil company grandees were expecting to obtain that mysterious and elusive gift of a "social licence." Higher taxes and emissions caps were to be the price paid for being allowed to ship oil to international markets via new pipelines. Notley's scheme "enables Alberta to be a leader, not only in climate policy, but also in ... collaborative solutions and energy development," Brian Ferguson, then-CEO of Cenovus, said. That his successor now sees a "full-blown economic crisis" provides convincing proof that the "collaborative solution" hasn't worked out as expected.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Amid the current crisis, these four carbon-tax backers now find their paths diverging sharply. <span class="companylink">Shell Canada</span> sold off its oilsands assets last year. Cenovus and <span class="companylink">Canadian Natural Resources</span> want an oil quota system to save their bacon. And Suncor argues the market should rule. In fairness, all should be ashamed of participating in what has now been revealed as a ruse. There was never any real prospect of a quid pro quo deal on pipelines. They were duped.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite emissions-caps and carbon taxes, no new pipelines have appeared to take Alberta's crude to waiting markets and none are realistically in the offing. The Trudeau government deliberately killed Northern Gateway in 2016 and later regulated Energy East to death. The Trans Mountain pipeline expansion is stuck in judicial purgatory. Even Keystone XL, which once looked like a sure thing under U.S. President Donald Trump, still faces interminable delays. And Bill C-69, currently in the Senate, threatens to turn future pipeline proposals into a regulatory nightmare.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The solution to Alberta's price-gap crisis is not oil quotas. It's pipelines, less red tape and lower taxes. And you can't get pipelines built by partnering with environmental groups, signalling virtuously on climate change or offering political cover for new carbon taxes and regulations. Surely Cenovus and Suncor, for all their differences, can now agree on that.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to innovation policy expert Professor Dan Breznitz, the technology that is now responsible for the majority of oilsands production - steam-assisted gravity drainage, or SAGD - would never have been developed without government. Without the Alberta Oil Sands Technology and Research Authority, AOSTRA, he recently told the National Post's "Innovation Nation" series, "there wouldn't have been an oilsands industry in Alberta." Ergo, more such targeted support for innovation is both necessary and viable. It's time for "us" to start "picking winners" again.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Given the role of government policies in currently crippling the oilsands industry, this would seem a rather ironic justification for more government. Indeed, this week Alberta Premier Rachel Notley specifically cited the potential threat to SAGD and other forms of "in situ" production from uncertainties in the Trudeau government's investment-killing Bill C-69.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, policy entrepreneurs must always be on the lookout for any and every case that might justify more - and, of course, better - policy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Trudeau Liberals last year introduced a Supercluster Initiative whose nodes are currently being unveiled and trumpeted. Professor Breznitz, who is Munk Chair of Innovation Studies at the <span class="companylink">University of Toronto</span>, was among those projecting success for "policies aiming to combine our worldquality innovation actors into cohesive and globally competitive eco-systems."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the real question - given the abject failure of past innovation policies - is not about the aim, but whether the target might be reached.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Not only is the story of AOSTRA and SAGD a little more complicated than presented, but if anybody wants to cite government success in promoting energy innovation, then a balanced perspective should also cite its myriad failures.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The concept of SAGD - which requires drilling pairs of horizontal wells, one to inject steam and one to extract the bitumen that the steam releases from the ground - was hatched by Dr. Roger Butler when he worked at <span class="companylink">Imperial Oil</span> in the late 1970s. Imperial scientists had already invented Cyclic Steam Stimulation, CSS, which involves injecting steam into a heavy oil reservoir under high pressure, then reversing the well to take the bitumen to the surface. Local geology meant that CSS worked at the company's Cold Lake development, but there were extensive heavy oil deposits in Alberta where CSS was not effective. Butler came up with SAGD, which Imperial patented, but the technology was uncertain, and Imperial already had plenty on its oilsands investment plate with both Cold Lake and its leadership of the Syncrude consortium. The company realized that even if SAGD worked, it wouldn't be in a position to use the technology for many years. Also, the prospects for the oilsands moved into reverse with the national energy program and the price collapse of the early 1980s.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Butler, like all great - and not so great - innovators, was convinced of the viability of his ideas and eager to test them. If Imperial was less than enthusiastic, the perfect place to look for funding was AOSTRA, which had been created by Peter Lougheed in 1974.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Butler thus moved to AOSTRA, and constructed an Underground Test Facility where he built his pilot plant with funding from Alberta's Heritage Fund and a number of other oil companies, who obviously believed in the potential of the technology.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So AOSTRA, thanks to Dr. Butler, did indeed play a significant role. But the key factor was the vision and drive of one man, who would not have come up with the idea unless he had worked at Imperial. This was a very rare case where a "winner" picked government.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile the notion that AOSTRA provides a justification or blueprint for more government innovation policy is profoundly flawed. The basic problem for oilsands production research has always been simple: how to separate the oil from the sand economically. That is quite different from government boosting the vague notion of "innovation." The insuperable problem is whose ideas to pick. For every Roger Butler there are many more Malcolm Bricklins waiting to foist their gull-winged dreams on gullible governments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And there are myriad failures to balance against AOS-TRA's role in SAGD. The national energy program stimulated innovations in hugely expensive Arctic offshore drilling platforms that were eventually sold off for cents on the dollar. Peter Lougheed's attempts at promoting diversification provided multiple failures. Government support for B.C.'s Ballard Power, which was supposed to lead us all to a hydrogen-fuelled future, ended up down the drain. And no innovation failure can rank with the current unravelling of governments'support for wind and solar power, which are expensive, unreliable and disruptive.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Choices about where to put taxpayers'money are inevitably constrained not just by not knowing where new ideas will appear, but by shifting political priorities and the burdens of bureaucratic oversight. Those problems cannot be wished, or washed, away with positive verbiage, or with recommendations for - yet more - arm's-length agencies. Promoting clusters has been on the innovation agenda for at least a quarter-century, with remarkably little success. What next? Super duper clusters? Governments can't promote success, but they want to be associated with it, and even successful companies find it hard to turn down free money. After all, they can't afford to make an enemy of government. Government can hurt them, as the oil industry knows only too well. A related problem is that every developed country on earth is concentrating on the same sectors - AI, electrified autonomous vehicles, genomics, etc., etc. - just as they once all decided to support aerospace and automobiles, with less-than-stellar results.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What innovation policy is primarily, and inevitably, about is government-assisted taxpayer drainage.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prime Minister Justin Trudeau had 2,000 angry protesters in the streets here last Thursday, one-third as many people as the Calgary Stampeders got on Tuesday for their Grey Cup victory party. It was an impressive showing on short notice; the Chamber of Commerce kept his visit under wraps until the last minute. For those who find Trudeau's handling of the energy file to be both hapless and patronizing, the prime minister gave his listeners heaping servings of both.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Perhaps impressed by Bill and Hillary Clinton's fundraising tour - for their favourite cause, themselves - in Toronto and Montreal this week, Trudeau looked fretful, and assured all concerned that he felt their pain.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's a routine that doesn't match the mood in Alberta. The general view here is that the federal government is the cause of the pain, so badly mismanaging the pipeline issue as to have prevented two from being built, and paying $4.5 billion to purchase the third, also not being built. And when I say "general" view, that now includes Premier Rachel Notley who, with an election six months off, is running as fast from Justin Trudeau as she spent the first three years of her mandate running toward him.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The juxtaposition of the <span class="companylink">General Motors</span> plant closure in Oshawa with the crisis in oil prices caused by lack of pipeline capacity was striking. Oshawa used to have some 23,000 GM workers in its heyday; it now has about a tenth of that. The loss of those remaining jobs is not only an economic hit, but psychological one, too. Autos are central to Oshawa's identity, even if the decline has been pronounced and protracted.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Calgary, it has been widely remarked that some 20 times as many jobs have been lost in recent years in the energy sector, in a much smaller provincial population. There was no one-year notice that the jobs were going. They were just gone.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Attention was paid, but not quite like what Oshawa got.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Oshawa story explains why the federal government does not seem to "get" the pipeline crisis in Alberta. It doesn't quite fit the way that flagship industries are treated in Canada.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The script is well-known.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pick your flagship sector, one that is economically vital and, more important, carries deep regional and cultural significance: the automotive industry in Ontario, aviation in Montreal, dairy in rural Ontario and Quebec, shipbuilding in Nova Scotia, fisheries in Newfoundland. A crisis hits and governments scramble. If government money will do the trick, shovels of it will be dumped on the relevant companies. If that won't work, the affected workers will be assisted directly, usually through expansion of unemployment benefits.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The actors know their roles so well that Ontario - then governed by the "green energy" McGuinty Liberals - gave GM $235 million in 2006 to build the not-so-enviro-friendly Camaro in Oshawa. A national crisis was declared in the 1990s when fisheries minister Brian Tobin wrapped himself in the flag and denounced European overfishing on the nose and tail of the Grand Banks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Alberta energy sector is not looking for subsidies, or enhanced unemployment benefits, or even a flag-waving champion. It simply is asking that governments stop preventing what private companies are seeking to do - namely, build pipelines so that Alberta oil and gas can get to world markets and not be held hostage by an American market that demands a deep discount.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"World" markets here refer, by the way, to Ontario and Quebec, which purchase oil from the state oil companies of various odious regimes around the planet, brought by tanker to the East Coast. The Energy East pipeline would have given Canada's major population centres the option of using Canadian oil, produced to Canadian environmental, labour and human-rights standards, but Energy East was killed by a federal government changing the regulatory approval rules.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Alberta's energy sector is not asking the government to do anything, but rather to stop preventing necessary things from being done. That's why Trudeau's visit was so tone-deaf. After so badly bungling the Trans Mountain pipeline project, the federal government bought it in the spring. That's the flagship sector script to a "T" - a massive infusion of tax dollars to do what the private sector won't do. Except that this time, the private sector was ready, willing and able to do so until blocked by the federal regulatory regime, at which time the government stepped in.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The reaction to the GM closure in Oshawa followed the standard script. Didn't the government give GM enough cash over the years to prevent this? Should it pony up some more now? If it's too late for that, can the workers get some enhanced government assistance? But that script does not fit Alberta's energy sector, which is why when the prime minister attempted to stage that play here last week, the reviews were universally negative.</p>

As The Globe and Mail reported, more than 100,000 of these wells are inactive and, rather than cleaning them up, major companies are walking away, pawning them off on smaller companies that can't carry the liability and often go bankrupt.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These wells are just the canary in the coal mine that is Canada's oil and gas industry. The oil sands themselves are leaving a massive liability as well. There are more than a trillion litres of toxic tailings ponds north of Fort McMurray, Alta. The toxins are leaching into the Athabasca River and poisoning downstream communities. And there is no known way to clean up these tailings ponds. The best idea the industry has been able to come up with is to pour water on them and wish the toxicity away. All told, the liabilities are estimated at up to $260-billion – almost six times Alberta's current debt, 300 times what Alberta received in oil and gas royalties in 2016 and more than 160 times the amount that the industry has set aside for cleaning it up.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In all likelihood, the cleanup of these wells will ultimately become the public's problem, at a hefty price tag. So, rather than fuelling our way to a low-carbon economy, further expansion of the oil and gas sector is setting up Canadians in general and Albertans specifically to be left holding the bag. Instead of propping up the industry through massive subsidies and tax breaks, we need to talk about how we can prevent that – and that means winding it down.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The scientific consensus is that the world needs to achieve net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by midcentury to avoid the most devastating consequences of climate change. This leaves no choice but to wind down Canada's oil and gas industry. And unless we start planning for this now, workers and communities will be left out of the transition to a low-carbon future. Instead, Canada is so beholden to the oil and gas sector that rather than making these companies actually set aside money for cleanup, or even draft credible plans for how they could clean up the mess, they are urging them onward.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Alberta Energy Regulator drafts weak regulations that fail to deal with the pollution these firms cause, and then turns a blind eye to bad deals that contravene even these weak rules.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The provincial government reduces royalty payments, so the resource is practically given away. The federal government extends tax breaks and subsidies, and by spending billions promoting the industry around the world, it has become an arm of the industry. Ottawa has even bought a pipeline, <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span>'s Trans Mountain.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The industry pushes for more expansion: more mines, more pipelines, more wells. And the government backs it because expansion is the mantra. Expansion is where they claim jobs are, and where new investment comes from.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And yet, even while production has grown over the past decade, employment has not. Corporate taxes paid by oil companies are down more than 60 per cent since 2006. Royalty revenue has declined 63 per cent since 2000, putting government balances in the red. Benefits from expansion prove fleeting, too: Permanent jobs for the Trans Mountain pipeline expansion, for example, amount to 50 in British Columbia and 40 in Alberta, and not the shiny numbers of temporary construction jobs politicians crow about.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Further expanding Canada's fossil fuel sector and building more infrastructure only puts the economy at greater risk. As the world responds to climate change, there is a push to move away from fossil fuels, and to do so aggressively. While we won't stop using oil and gas today, it is economically illogical to increase production of fuels and bankroll expensive long-term assets, such as pipelines and mines, if the future doesn't include them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If the oil and gas sector continues to grow, so too will its liability. If we fail to police the industry, the risks will increase. If governments keep propping up these companies, Canadians will have more to lose when they fail.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And, ultimately, for humanity to succeed, oil and gas companies must fail. It's time to acknowledge this – and start talking about an exit strategy.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Premier Rachel Notley said on Wednesday while in Ottawa that she'd be buying rail cars to help ship an additional 120,000 barrels of oil per day. This would help as a medium-term solution to the oil differential, as the project would be running in late 2019.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Earlier in November, the premier appointed three special envoys to meet with energy experts and the industry to come up with a solution.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, Opposition leader Jason Kenney offered up his plan of attack — an amendment to a piece of legislation that would see the government enforce a temporary period of oil production curtailments on the industry. The cuts would equal about 400,000 barrels per day, or about 10 per cent of total production.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This, Kenney said, would cut down the oversupply of oil in Alberta and reduce the surplus from 35 million barrels to 17 million. It could help close the differential gap between Western Canadian Select crude and West Texas Intermediate crude from about $40 to $20.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The United Conservative Party leader is trying to push through his legislative amendment before the house rises in December. The government hasn't ruled out his plan.</p>

Experts to work with energy industry on oil price solutions for Alberta[https://www.thestar.com/business/2018/11/19/experts-to-work-with-energy-industry-on-oil-price-solutions-for-alberta.html]
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Both leaders have described the differential as a crisis. But what is it, what does it mean for Alberta, and is anyone actually losing $80 million a day?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What is the oil differential?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Picture you are selling a product to someone out there, in the world market. There's some prevailing price out there in the world market and you don't have a lot of influence on that, so you're a price taker,” said Trevor Tombe, an economics professor at the University of Calgary.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Whatever the world price is, that's what you are going to get. But to get your product to that market, you have to ship it. So the price that you effectively get after deducting those shipment costs, that's the price that we are looking at in Alberta.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pipelines are full, so barrels move on to rail and trucks. This is a very expensive way to move oil, said Tombe. Without more pipeline capacity, this problem isn't likely to let up soon and it's causing a wide differential gap.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Political leaders in Alberta have said the difference between Western Canadian Select oil and West Texas Intermediate oil is costing the Canadian economy somewhere between $80 million and $100 million per day.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">However, Tombe said the differential wasn't so bad in October, and that November saw a big drop.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The closer that we get to the election, the more everything is going to seem like a crisis,” Tombe said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“People are looking at the price today and going, 'Wow, it fell by $40-$50 bucks a barrel? This is going to lead to another recession of the same magnitude in 2014/15 when prices fell by roughly the same amount,' but that's not really the case.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's more complex than that.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Is the economy losing $80 million per day?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists aren't settled on the data behind this number.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When StarMetro asked for a citation, a spokesperson with the UCP said the $80-million to $100-million range has been in public discourse and a number that has been used in meetings that Kenney has had with stakeholders.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A spokesperson for the government said it arrived at the number through a Scotiabank report[https://www.gbm.scotiabank.com/content/dam/gbm/scotiaeconomics63/pipeline_approval_delays_2018-02-20.pdf] released in February. The report gives a range of $40 million per day to $100 million per day, and Tombe said it's the best public analysis out there.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“There's a lot of complexity in that market that makes it very hard to hang our hat on any specific number,” said Tombe. “And, in general, I think we ought to be very suspicious of governments now when they're talking about these difficult to calculate numbers.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Robyn Allan, an economist and former CEO of ICBC, doesn't believe the $80-million number because she said it comes from the supposition that every barrel is getting the lowest price, and that's not the case.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She said many producers have either contracted their way out of having to pay the lowest price for oil (which is around $14 per barrel, based on what the government has claimed about the differential) or they're one of the big three — <span class="companylink">Husky Energy</span>, <span class="companylink">Imperial Oil</span> or <span class="companylink">Suncor Energy</span>. These three companies make up about 60 per cent of the market, Allan said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The big three are integrated, meaning they are both sellers and buyers on the market and aren't subjected to the low differential price, Allan said. Integrated companies deal in all levels of operation, from production and discovery to refining.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This was a deliberate investment choice by the companies made during years gone by when they could see that a price differential could potentially hurt them. They made the choice to integrate because of that, Allan said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“This is the unfortunate part of how this political posturing, either based on deliberate deception or ignorance, is harming our economy,” Allan said. “Because you've got companies … who have strategies that they've paid for and now they're being saddled with this narrative that the entire industry is suffering on every barrel.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tombe said Albertans should take the politicians' $80-million figure “with a big grain of salt.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Why is some oil protected from this differential?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tom McMillan, a spokesperson for Pengrowth Energy, said his company is contracted to refineries in a way that protects them from getting the low differential price. They ship about 26,000 barrels per day, however, are not subject to a potential government curtailment if Kenney's plan goes through. It excludes smaller companies like Pengrowth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I mean, we've seen a lot of headlines around the spot price and (how) the spot price differential is blown out. But the actual answer is a lot more complicated,” said McMillan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">His company put out a press release Thursday with data from October and November to show how it hasn't been as impacted by the oil differential. In fact, about 90 per cent of its oil is protected by contractual agreements with folks they ship to so that they get better prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“You can imagine investors being concerned about this,” he said of the publicity around the differential. “The whole point of the press release is to say, 'We understand the spot price on distressed barrels is very disconcerting, however, it's not that simple, and by the way, this is what we're actually getting on our barrels.'”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In October, Pengrowth got a weighted average differential of $24 (U.S.) per barrel and in November, it estimated it to be $28.60 (U.S.). The numbers are smaller than the $40 differential that political leaders have put out there and Pengrowth attributes the success to the protective contracts it negotiated.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Allan said that the big three companies are also getting better prices for their oil than the differential would suggest since Pengrowth is an intermediate company and the big three are “very sophisticated.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many companies have these contracts that protect them from the lowest price.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She said the market is working the way it is supposed to, with the larger and smarter companies protecting themselves from the differential. Government intervention via a production curtailment would do more harm than good, she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“You're sending a signal that says basically, 'We want to attract the least responsible companies, the companies that don't plan ahead, and protect them from exposure to market factors.' That's the message,” said Allan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What are the oil companies saying?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lisa Schmidt, a spokesperson for Imperial Oil, said they do not support government intervention.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Government intervention that would have the objective to manipulate market prices would send a negative message to investors,” she said. “This current situation, while difficult, is in fact indicative that the market is working and that production that is higher-cost is already being curtailed without intervention.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She said that increasing capacity for transporting oil is in the best interests of all stakeholders in the market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In an emailed statement to StarMetro, a spokesperson from <span class="companylink">Husky Energy</span> said: “Market intervention comes with an unacceptably high level of economic and trade risk.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They said the market was working the way it was supposed to as well. <span class="companylink">Suncor Energy</span> declined to comment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">All the companies StarMetro spoke to cited increased pipeline capacity as the overall solution for the ongoing oil differential, something government leaders agree with. But in the short term, they had issues with government intervention in the market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“These things sort themselves out over the long term,” McMillan said. “But I do think there's some interesting ideas in there, both what's been proposed by Rachel Notley and Jason Kenney.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I hope that they can work together to solve the issues, or help solve the issues, facing our industry.”</p>

("Prairie Provident" or the "Company") announces that the Toronto Stock Exchange ("TSX") has accepted for filing the Company's notice of intention to make a normal course issuer bid ("NCIB"). The NCIB effectively renews the existing NCIB, which is scheduled to end on November 30, 2018.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pursuant to the renewed NCIB, Prairie Provident may purchase from time to time up to a maximum of 5,000,000 common shares, at such times and in such quantities as the Company may determine, subject to applicable regulatory restrictions. Purchases under the NCIB may be made through open market transactions on the TSX and any alternative Canadian trading platforms on which the common shares are traded, based on the prevailing market price. Any common shares purchased under the NCIB will be cancelled.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Transactions under the NCIB will depend on future market conditions. Prairie Provident retains discretion whether to make purchases under the NCIB, and to determine the timing, amount and acceptable price of any such purchases, subject at all times to applicable TSX and other regulatory requirements.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The renewed NCIB period will commence on December 4, 2018 and end on December 3, 2019 or such earlier date as the NCIB is completed or is terminated at the Company's election.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Under TSX rules, not more than 19,330 common shares (being 25% of the average daily trading volume on the TSX of 77,321 common shares for the six months ended October 2018) can be purchased on the TSX on any single trading day under the renewed NCIB, except that one block purchase in excess of the daily maximum is permitted per calendar week.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The NCIB provides the Company with an additional capital allocation alternative with a view to long-term shareholder value. In circumstances where the prevailing market price of the common shares does not reflect what Prairie Provident believes to be the underlying value of its business and assets, a purchase of common shares for cancellation under the NCIB may provide an opportunity to enhance shareholder value by increasing the proportionate equity interest of remaining shareholders at an attractive valuation and improving per share metrics on an accretive basis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Company has appointed <span class="companylink">Cormark Securities Inc</span>. as its broker to make any NCIB purchases on its behalf.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As of November 29, 2018, there were 172,113,876 common shares outstanding, of which 118,044,001 common shares are considered to be in the public float as freely tradeable shares not held by directors, officers or principal shareholders of the Company. Accordingly, the maximum 5,000,000 common shares that may be purchased under the renewed NCIB represents approximately 2.9% of the number of common shares currently outstanding, and approximately 4.2% of the public float.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prairie Provident previously received approval from the TSX to purchase up to 4,900,000 common shares under its existing NCIB, representing approximately 9.8% of its public float at the time of commencement, during the December 1, 2017 to November 30, 2018 bid period. In the last twelve months, the Company purchased a total of 273,000 common shares under the current NCIB through market purchases on the TSX, at a volume-weighted average purchase price of approximately $0.339 per share.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">REGINA — The Saskatchewan deficit grew over the last quarter and the finance minister says fluctuations in the discounted price of Canadian oil has her concerned.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While oil prices were higher earlier in the year, they have been on a downward trend in recent weeks, leading Saskatchewan to shave almost $88 million off of its first-quarter oil-and-gas revenue projections.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Higher prices for West Texas Intermediate were almost entirely offset by a widening of the differential that heavier Canadian oil sells for on global markets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We're now in kind of uncharted territory and we're seeing a differential that we have not seen for a longer period of time," Finance Minister Donna Harpauer said Thursday as she released the mid-year fiscal update. "That's concerning as we build our next budget."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite those headwinds, Harpauer said the government still plans to balance the books by next year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The mid-year fiscal update pegs the deficit at $348 million, up $42 million from first-quarter estimates. But that figure is still $17 million lower than projected on budget day.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Overall, revenue is up more than $138 million from the spring budget, but expenses are forecast to be $121 million higher. Nearly half of that latter figure is because of increased pension expenses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Over-supply and access to markets outside the U.S. are to blame for the lower price of Canadian oil.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Harpauer said it's been two years since the federal government approved the Trans Mountain pipeline expansion from Alberta to B.C. but nothing has happened since. She said having the pipeline, which would triple capacity on the line, would help.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We can't impress (enough) upon the citizens of this country — not just the citizens of Saskatchewan — how important this capacity would be," Harpauer said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's the same argument that is being made next door in Alberta, where Premier Rachel Notley announced Wednesday that her government plans to buy enough new rail cars to ship another 120,000 barrels of oil a day.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Harpauer said she understands Alberta's desperation, but doesn't believe transporting oil by rail is the answer. She also doesn't see Saskatchewan following a similar path because she said the province has the rail line capacity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I'm not sure what else we can do," Harpauer said. "We are a bottle-necked, land-locked province and we need transportation capacity. And to me the safest is pipelines."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Opposition NDP Leader Ryan Meili said he's concerned by the government's refusal to take part in discussions like the ones Alberta is having around oil.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Talk to our neighbours in Alberta and the experts they've had on this and actually be part of that conversation rather than just sniping from the sidelines," Meili said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meili also expressed concern with the government's spending and said the province's debt has tripled in the last four years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A provincial sales tax hike to six per cent from five in the 2017 budget is boosting revenue and hurting people, he said.</p>

<span class="companylink">Bank of Nova Scotia</span> ( BNS-T[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/investing/markets/stocks/BNS-T/] ). You might be tempted to invest in <span class="companylink">Bank of Nova Scotia</span> because of its big dividend yield, low valuation or large emerging-markets footprint. But here’s a better reason: The stock is a dud.[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/investing/markets/inside-the-market/article-why-scotiabank-looks-like-the-best-bank-stock-to-buy-right-now/] The share price has slumped 13.5 per cent so far in 2018, making it the worst-performing stock among Canada’s five biggest banks. It has underperformed its peers by 7.2 percentage points (not including dividends). And the stock has trailed the year’s best performer, Toronto-Dominion Bank, by 11.3 percentage points. So why warm to a cold bank? The answer lies in a simple stock-picking strategy: Since lagging banks have an impressive track record of catching up with their big-bank peers relatively quickly, investors can score market-beating gains by scooping them up.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It’s a great time to buy REITs. Here are 3 solid options that yield more than 6%</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Real estate investment trusts deserve a place in every well-balanced portfolio. REITs offer above-average yields, provide the potential for capital growth and – unlike a direct investment in a rental property – they don’t require you to get your hands dirty. All you do is put up your capital and the REIT’s management takes care of the rest – collecting rent, leasing vacant space, doing repairs and acquiring new properties. Now is a good time to shop for REITs [https://www.theglobeandmail.com/investing/investment-ideas/article-three-solid-reits-that-yield-more-than-6-per-cent/] because, with the recent rise in interest rates, many REIT unit prices are well off their highs. That means their yields, which move in the opposite direction to the unit price, have risen. So you get more cash flow for every dollar you invest. John Heinzl takes a look at three REITs to invest in. (for subscribers).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Why Alberta’s latest oil-price plunge is unprecedented</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For months, much of the focus on Alberta’s oil-price woes has centred on Western Canadian Select. That’s understandable because heavy oil accounts for about half of Canada’s crude production, and WCS is the heavy-oil benchmark. Earlier this month, it plunged to a record low of less than US$14 a barrel, and currently sits around US$19. But what about the other half of production? The situation is likewise grim[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/business/industry-news/energy-and-resources/article-why-albertas-latest-oil-price-plunge-is-unprecedented/] . Two lighter oil benchmarks, used in pricing about 40 per cent of Canada’s crude production, have dropped precipitously over the past three months to less than US$30 a barrel. Those benchmarks – Edmonton Mixed Sweet and Synthetic Crude – now sell at steep discounts to U.S. crude, a sign that no corner of Alberta’s oil industry is untouched by pricing challenges. Matt Lundy reports.</p>

It will end 2018 at 2,800, which would be a near 5-per-cent gain over last year, according to the poll median. But the 2019 forecast marks a drop from three months ago, when strategists polled by Reuters predicted the index would reach 3,100 by the end of 2019. (For subscribers).</p>

Eighteen financial stocks that offer value, safety and stability[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/investing/investment-ideas/number-cruncher/article-eighteen-financial-stocks-that-offer-value-safety-and-stability/]
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ask Globe Investor</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Question: What are the tax implications of <span class="companylink">Loblaw Cos. Ltd</span>.’s spin-out of <span class="companylink">Choice Properties Real Estate Investment Trust</span>?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Answer: As I discussed in a recent column[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/investing/education/article-explaining-the-big-drop-in-loblaws-stock/] , Loblaw minority shareholders received 0.135 of a <span class="companylink">George Weston Ltd</span>. share in exchange for giving up their interest in <span class="companylink">Choice Properties REIT</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">From a tax perspective, there are a couple of things you need to know.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">First, the <span class="companylink">George Weston</span> shares were received on a tax-free basis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Second, Loblaw shareholders will need to calculate a new adjusted cost base (ACB) for their Loblaw shares. They will also need to determine an ACB for their new <span class="companylink">George Weston</span> shares.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The math is fairly straightforward. In a press release,[https://www.newswire.ca/news-releases/loblaw-announces-closing-of-plan-of-arrangement-to-spin-out-choice-properties-reit-699264391.html] the company said the new ACB for Loblaw shares should be equivalent to 80.1 per cent of the investor’s old Loblaw ACB, with the remaining 19.9 per cent allocated to the new <span class="companylink">George Weston</span> shares.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For example, say an investor bought 200 Loblaw shares at $50 each several years ago, for a total ACB of $10,000. Following the Choice spin-out, the 200 Loblaw shares would have a new ACB of $8,010 (80.1 per cent of $10,000) or $40.05 a Loblaw share.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The remaining $1,990 (19.9 per cent of $10,000) of the original ACB would be allocated to the 27 <span class="companylink">George Weston</span> shares (0.135 times 200) received in the transaction. That works out to an ACB of $73.70 for each <span class="companylink">George Weston</span> share.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Note that the investor’s total cost base of $10,000 hasn’t changed – it’s just been divided between the existing Loblaw shares and the new <span class="companylink">George Weston</span> shares. When an investor ultimately sells all or part of her Loblaw or <span class="companylink">George Weston</span> shares, she would use the new ACBs per share to determine her capital gain or loss.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Just to be clear: The ACBs per share calculated here apply only to this example. Investors must use the above formula to calculate the ACBs for their own situation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It’s possible that your broker may have already done the calculations for you. If you’ve noticed that the “book value” or “cost basis” of your Loblaw shares has changed on your brokerage statement, that’s likely the reason. Still, it doesn’t hurt to check if your broker’s ACB is correct.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Absent an epic December rebound, 2018 will go down as the year in which nearly everything declined.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A synchronized global slump has dragged down stocks, bonds, gold and crude oil, inflicting year-to-date losses on an unprecedented proportion of assets around the world.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of the dozens of asset classes across various kinds of securities and commodities in developed and emerging markets, 90 per cent of them are down on the year in U.S.-dollar terms, according to <span class="companylink">Deutsche Bank</span>. In more than a century of market data, never has a calendar year seen so many assets post negative returns.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That global downdraft has weighed on Canadian markets as well. The S&P/TSX Composite Index has dropped by 6.4 per cent on the year, the rise in interest rates and bond yields mean both government and corporate bonds have seen moderate price declines, the Canadian dollar has lost almost 5 US cents and the price of Alberta crude oil has plunged by 50 per cent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“It’s been much less fun than we’ve become accustomed to,” said Craig Basinger, chief investment officer at Richardson GMP. “We came into this year with a full head of steam. Then all of a sudden, the pendulum swung.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That swing has been made all the more dramatic by just how good a year 2017 was for investors worldwide. By <span class="companylink">Deutsche Bank</span>’s count, 99 per cent of global financial asset classes posted gains in U.S. dollars last year, the only outlier being the Phillipines bond market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“An amazing couple of years nonetheless as we swing from one extreme to the other,” <span class="companylink">Deutsche Bank</span> strategist Craig Nicol wrote. “This is what happens when the vast majority of global assets are expensive historically due to extreme monetary policy."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The measures employed by central banks in reaction to the global financial crisis pumped trillions of dollars into the world economy, largely through bond purchases.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That money made its way into assets of all kinds as low interest rates and quantitative easing remained in place for most of the past decade.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We know for certain that that inflated asset prices across the board,” Mr. Basinger said. “It did for real estate, it did for commodities – at least initially – and it certainly did for the stock market.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The recent emergence of inflationary pressures and the strengthening of the U.S. economy now has the market contemplating regime change.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The withdrawal of stimulus and the rise of interest rates seem to have stoked investors’ concerns about valuations, which has played out most visibly in the case of U.S. tech shares. In the five months up to the end of last week, the FAANG group of stocks declined by 24 per cent, providing the spark for a global sell-off.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In that kind of environment, investors will often seek shelter in safe havens, or those assets that tend to be less correlated or negatively correlated to equities. This year, however, most of the defensive segments of the market have declined alongside stocks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Gold is down 6 per cent on the year, while U.S. treasuries have dropped in price as rates have pushed higher.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“When the tide goes out you’re more likely to get en masse negative months rather than rotation from … equities into bonds, or visa-versa,” <span class="companylink">Deutsche Bank</span>’s Mr. Nicol said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Wednesday, U.S. Federal Reserve chairman Jerome Powell suggested that interest rates are “just below” neutral, which seemed to allay the market’s fears of quickly rising rates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A strong day for equities followed, reinforcing the market’s preference for the kind of low-speed economy that has characterized most of the past 10 years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That sweet spot for stocks is likely to persist, Barry Schwartz, chief investment officer at Baskin Wealth Management, said in an online post.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We believe that the North American economy is neither so good that interest rates will rise too far, nor is it so weak that a recession is imminent.”</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">Ontario Securities Commission</span> is fretting over naive investors who may be spending thousands on what have proven to be frothy cannabis stocks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Several factors give rise to concern about the risks retail investors are taking in this emerging sector,” the OSC warned in a study released this week.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Indeed, as The Globe and Mail’s Mike Hager reports, almost one in four marijuana investors have spent at least $10,000, the OSC said, and many are unsophisticated, buying with little knowledge.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Canadian cannabis companies’ stock prices have skyrocketed in recent years as several jurisdictions have explored new laws around the sale and use of cannabis,” the securities regulator said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The legalization of cannabis in Canada in October, 2018, drew further attention and interest to the sector,” it added.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“In the past few months, however, industry insiders and analysts have expressed concern about whether cannabis companies’ stock prices have raced ahead their growth prospects.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An OSC survey, done by Innovative Research Group in October among almost 2,300 Canadians, shed light on just who’s buying, and what they’re basing their investments on, leading to the regulator’s warning.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">First, here’s a look at the money spent, with not all categories, such as “don’t know,” left out:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Among the troubling findings is that investing “didn’t vary” based on risk tolerance or market knowledge.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Those with low financial knowledge or who reported having a low risk tolerance were as likely as individuals with higher knowledge or risk tolerance to own cannabis investments,” the OSC said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Our survey results indicate that many cannabis investors entered the sector recently, and that word of mouth was a key source of information.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Indeed, 32 per cent got at least some of their advice from family members or friends, while 18 per cent listened to a financial rep or portfolio manager.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Behavioural insights show that some investors may be predisposed to seek out and buy into the latest, most popular investments – and may do so even if these investments don’t fit their long-term financial goals,” the OSC said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“These investors may overestimate their risk tolerance and might not diversify their investments enough.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As for who’s buying, or at least thinking about it, here’s what the survey also showed:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And an interesting postscript to that: A mid-2018 study found men in that 18-34 age category were also “more likely to own cryptoassets than any other demographic group.”</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A scene I’d love to see</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Oil tumbles, but ...</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The benchmark U.S. oil price temporarily slipped below US$50 a barrel today, but, notes CIBC World Markets, Canada and its energy patch can still “breathe a collective sigh of relief.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Joan Pinto, associate, energy specialist at CIBC, was referring to Alberta Premier Rachel Notley’s announcement Wednesday that she plans to buy rail cars to boost shipments by 120,000 barrels a day.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This should help the price of the Western Canada Select benchmark that is significantly below West Texas intermediate and Brent crude.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Implementation will, of course, take a few weeks, and at best one can expect price movement in the WCS January 2019 future after excess barrels start to clear the market,” Ms. Pinto said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“With an acute case of stranded supply as we’ve faced, <span class="companylink">OPEC</span>-style rhetoric won’t do the trick.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WTI fell below US$50 as markets speculated over next week’s meeting of <span class="companylink">OPEC</span> and its allies in a production-cap agreement, referred to as OPEC+, which is expected to cut supply again.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Global benchmarks have sunk lower over what the market has perceived to be question marks with respect to OPEC+ cutting output next week,” Ms. Pinto said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Reading through the transcript from the Saudi energy minister, we believe his comments reflect the typical ongoing dialogue for collective action between members,” she added.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We see this as no different than prior consensus-building in the run-up to past <span class="companylink">OPEC</span> gatherings.”</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Good morning. We start today with a little story about an arrow from finance reporter Bill Curry:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Conservative attacks on Liberal spending took an unusual twist online this week, when the party circulated an alarming-looking graphic on social media[https://twitter.com/CPC_HQ/status/1067815480482684933] that appeared to portray a declining debt-to-GDP ratio as something to fear.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The chart showed a red line moving down sharply over a dark map of Canada, quoting a news headline that said: “debt-to-GDP ratio declining, no path to balance.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The image then links to a Conservative Party video warning about the rise in federal debt.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While many economists have criticized the Liberals for failing to produce a timeline for balancing the books, a declining debt-to-GDP ratio is widely viewed as a positive economic indicator.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Liberal MP Joël Lightbound said in an e-mail that the Conservatives should delete the post. He said the Conservatives either don’t understand basic economics or are deliberately trying to confuse Canadians.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Conservative Party spokesperson Cory Hann said the arrow is meant to illustrate that the government is going deeper into the red by running bigger deficits.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A deficit is the amount that government spending exceeds revenue in a given fiscal year. The debt is the running tally of those amounts over time, minus any annual surpluses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Finance Minister Bill Morneau’s fall fiscal update showed the federal debt is on pace to grow from $671.3-billion in 2017-18 to $764.7-billion in 2023-24, a 13.9 per cent increase.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">However international comparisons of government debt tend to focus on the debt-to-GDP ratio, which measures how the size of government debt compares in relation to the size of the overall economy. If the economy grows faster than the debt, the debt-to-GDP ratio can go down even when a government adds to the debt in real dollar terms by running a deficit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The fall update said the federal debt-to-GDP ratio is forecasted to decline from 31.4 per cent to 28.5 per cent from 2017-18 to 2023-24.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Liberals had previously promised to stop running annual deficits by 2019, but are no longer planning to keep that promise and have not set a date for returning to balance.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Morneau has said his budgets are guided by a new “fiscal anchor,” which is to keep the debt-to-GDP ratio on a declining trend.</p>

Debra Soh (The Globe and Mail)[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/opinion/article-in-academia-censorship-and-conformity-have-become-the-norm/] on discourse in academia: “Based on conversations I’ve had with colleagues still working in academia and from what I can tell about recent cases of censorship, the antagonism is primarily from left-leaning colleagues attacking other liberals.

Don Braid (Calgary Herald)[https://calgaryherald.com/news/politics/braid-with-ottawa-absent-alberta-has-to-act-like-a-country] on Alberta buying rail cars: “Since 1930, natural resources have belonged to the province and by extension the people. [Peter] Lougheed made the point frequently during the great battles of the 1980s. He took on the oil companies even when major players were deeply annoyed. In all the intervening years up to this moment, there has never been a more compelling case for doing it again.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Keith Brooks (The Globe and Mail)[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/opinion/article-its-time-for-an-exit-strategy-from-oil-and-gas/] on the future of oil in Canada: “So rather than fuelling our way to a low-carbon economy, further expansion of the oil and gas sector is setting up Canadians in general and Albertans specifically to be left holding the bag. Instead of propping up the industry though massive subsidies and tax breaks, we need to talk about how we can prevent that – and that means winding it down.”</p>

() (TSX: BNE) (“Bonterra” or the “Company”) today announces an adjustment to its monthly dividend to $0.01 per share commencing with the November 2018 dividend payable December 31, 2018.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In response to the recent significant increase in the Canadian oil price differentials for light oil, and deteriorating West Texas Intermediate (“WTI’) prices, Bonterra is taking necessary steps to protect its balance sheet and prudently manage cash outflows between debt repayment, the monthly dividend payment and capital spending. Since Q3 2018, Bonterra has seen its realized oil price decline from C$77.20 per barrel to approximately C$21.50 per barrel today. Until there is a required rebalancing of supply and demand, which could occur through a number of factors including the willingness of provincial and federal governments to build pipelines taking oil to tidewater, further industry production shut-ins, additional crude by rail capacity coming on-line, the start-up of Enbridge Line 3 replacement and refinery demand increases, these steps remain necessary to protect the value of Bonterra for our shareholders.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bonterra remains committed to a dividend paying strategy. As evidenced by the Company’s dividend and capital spending history, Bonterra will continue to monitor the broader commodity price environment and resultant corporate cash flows. Bonterra remains one of the lowest cost producers of conventional light sweet oil, and should pricing permit, the Company has maintained the flexibility to adjust the dividend, increase capital spending or a combination of both.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The province’s Attorney-General David Eby (seen above) said he is “incredibly disappointed” by the news that criminal charges were stayed[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/canada/british-columbia/article-bc-money-laundering-charges-stayed-in-a-high-profile-case/] in a money-laundering case he called the largest in B.C. history. Eby said he’s launching a review to figure out what went wrong in the RCMP’s investigation, which focused on an organized crime group believed to be laundering large amounts of cash through B.C. casinos.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The RCMP wouldn’t disclose its reasons for agreeing to a stay of charges, but said it is “conducting a full-scale review to understand its activities, which contributed to this stay.” Charges are stayed if there’s no reasonable prospect of a conviction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A lack of regulatory oversight in the province sparked the nickname the “Vancouver model” as organized-crime groups used casinos and real estate to hide drug money.

That information was subsequently relayed to senior party officials, including members of the Prime Minister’s Office. It wasn’t known to whom the money was owed, the source said. Grewal’s mother said he is in treatment to deal with his issues. Sources have said Grewal, who is resigning his seat, spent millions over the past three years on gambling. The Conservatives and NDP are accusing him of misusing his position on the House of Commons finance committee by asking RCMP officials about techniques used to fight money laundering.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The video posted to social media this week shows a teenager named Jamal being assaulted by an older boy who grabs him by the throat, throws him to the ground and pours water in his face while saying “I’ll drown you.” Jamal’s sister was also bullied so much at the same school that she tried to kill herself, a lawyer representing the family said. A video of her being shoved to the ground was posted online yesterday.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Under pressure to find alternatives to ship oil amid a lack of pipeline capacity, Premier Rachel Notley said her province is close to concluding a deal[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/business/article-alberta-set-to-buy-rail-cars-to-boost-crude-shipments/] to purchase crude cars and locomotives (for subscribers). Alberta crude prices have fallen sharply compared with the North American benchmark, an issue Notley blamed on capacity constraints. She said buying rail cars would also be of value over the longer term as a stopgap against further pipeline days.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Notley reiterated her call for Justin Trudeau to offer financial support: “The federal government should be at the table on this. There’s no excuse for their absence.” The federal Natural Resources department said it was working with Alberta to explore options to “address the crisis.”</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Only two months after Jamal Khashoggi’s death, Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman (known as MBS) is on tour to signal to his country and the world that he isn’t going away. His next stop: this week’s G20 Leadership Summit in Buenos Aires. But G20 country leaders should not let MBS use his much-promoted photo opportunities and meetings with them to normalize his behaviour. … Domestic criticism of MBS is growing as many Saudis wonder what other missteps the 33-year old prince might engineer that could endanger Saudis’ vision for a new and reformed kingdom. Cracks within the regime are being rumoured, but to hasten these fissures, the international community ought to signal to the Saudi state that there will be no return to business as usual.” –  Bessma Momani [https://www.theglobeandmail.com/opinion/article-true-leaders-must-stop-the-saudi-crown-princes-normalization-tour/] , professor at the Balsillie School of International Affairs</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“...every Quebec premier must understand that his top task is to protect the province’s distinct culture against any threat, be it real or perceived. For Quebec Premier François Legault, a former sovereigntist, this comes naturally. Wednesday’s throne speech opening the first session of the first Coalition Avenir Québec government confirmed Legault’s intention to proceed with legislation, likely in the spring, to prohibit state employees in a position of authority from wearing conspicuous religious symbols. “This question has been dragging on for 10 years now. Quebeckers have had enough,” Legault said after the Throne Speech. Legault insists his proposed ban on religious symbols – which would apply to judges, police officers, Crown prosecutors, prison guards and teachers – has majority support among Quebeckers. And on that point, at least, he’s unequivocally correct.” – Konrad Yakabuski[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/opinion/article-legaults-appalling-plan-to-ban-religious-symbols-is-a-political/] (for subscribers)</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MOMENT IN TIME</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The birth of George Brown</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nov. 29, 1818: This newspaper’s founding proprietor was born 200 years ago this day in a Scottish village. George Brown’s reform-minded father moved the family to New York, where he established a newspaper. But young George preferred British to U.S. rule, and in 1844, he established The Globe in Toronto, which quickly became the most influential newspaper in British North America. Brown championed technological innovation, prison reform and responsible government in opposition to the Tory elites. The Reform Party and movement he effectively led eventually became the Liberal Party. Like many journalists, Brown made an indifferent politician, and during his time in Parliament, he was consistently bested by his Conservative rival, John A. Macdonald. But after years of unstable, short-lived governments, it was Brown who proposed the Great Coalition, which made Confederation possible. Macdonald, not Brown, became prime minister, of course, but that was all right, because Brown was always at heart a newspaperman. In a way, the paper killed him. In March, 1880, he was accidentally shot in the thigh by an irate former employee. The wound became infected and he died in May. But Brown’s legacy is great: He founded what became The Globe and Mail, helped forge the Liberal Party and proposed the compromise that led to Confederation. – John Ibbitson</p>

<span class="companylink">Royal Bank of Canada</span> reported solid profits on Wednesday for the ninth straight year, and, like clockwork, the bank’s executives were rewarded with skeptical questions from analysts about the odds of future success.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Such scrutiny is almost automatic for Canada’s largest public company by stock-market value. Canadian banks have faced one obstacle after another over the past decade. There was the financial crisis, the slow economic recovery, the fears of a housing bubble, the collapse of energy prices from 2014 to 2016. Now, the price of Alberta heavy oil is tumbling again.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But through it all, the country’s biggest banks have remained sturdy – and RBC has been one of the most dependable. Its total profit in fiscal 2018, which ended Oct. 31, hit $12.4-billion. That’s 38 per cent higher than the earnings announced five years before.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For all that growth, RBC can’t shake the questions about its resilience. Before Wednesday, its shares had fallen 4.9 per cent in the past 12 months, despite delivering better earnings in each consecutive quarter over the past year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The latest results did persuade buyers to push the stock the stock 2.7 per cent higher on Wednesday, to $98.10. But the broader market also rose sharply. Winning over investors is expected to remain tough.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The market is pricing in substantial headwinds for 2019,” Eight Capital analyst Steve Theriault wrote in a research report on Wednesday. RBC’s stock trades at less than 12 times last year’s earnings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What is the root of the market’s skepticism? On top of regular hiccups such as commodity price swings, which threaten to bring higher loan losses in Alberta, the 2008 crash still lingers in some investors' minds. There have been continuous political, economic and market disruptions in the decade since – everything from the unexpected election of U.S. President Donald Trump to the quantitative easing that lasted longer than many thought it would and suppressed interest rates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, by now, RBC’s continued strength is tough to overlook. On Wednesday, the bank reported that its Tier 1 capital ratio is 11.5 per cent, a full percentage point higher than RBC’s target level, and much higher than it was before the financial crisis. That means the bank has loads of money tucked away to serve as a buffer when a downturn comes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">RBC’s return on equity, one of the industry’s most closely watched metrics, also sits at 17.6 per cent. To put that in perspective, <span class="companylink">JP Morgan Chase & Co</span>. is constantly praised as one of the world’s best-run banks, but its ROE is 14 per cent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This return largely stems from a stellar personal and commercial banking (P&C) business that contributes nearly 50 per cent of RBC’s bottom line. The division remains highly profitable, despite a recent housing slowdown. In fiscal 2018, the bank’s residential mortgage portfolio grew 5 per cent, but total P&C revenues rose 8.6 per cent in the fourth quarter, compared with the previous year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Companies are investing. Employment is strong. There are a number of tailwinds from an economic perspective," chief financial officer Rod Bolger said in an interview.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The strong economy means interest rates are rising at last, and that has been a major boon to lenders, allowing them to charge more for mortgages and many other loans. The rates banks pay on deposits are also rising, but not as quickly.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of course, nothing lasts forever, and lately there are growing expectations of a U.S. recession, or at least a sharp slowdown. Asked about the largest systemic threats that RBC faces, Mr. Bolger, the CFO, cited trade tensions and the risk of higher unemployment. At the moment, this threat is most imminent in Alberta, because the province is wrestling with low prices for oil and gas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As for RBC’s own oil and gas exposure, chief risk officer Graeme Hepworth brushed off the questions on Wednesday, noting that the sector amounts to only 1 per cent of RBC’s total loan book and calling the risk “pretty small, pretty manageable.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">RBC must also demonstrate that its U.S. City National division will deliver better profits. The bank has invested in it this year, and that has taken the steam out of profit expansion. The American market dynamics are also changing, with many affluent and high-net-worth clients moving their money out of deposits and into better-yielding assets, which makes it harder for banks such as <span class="companylink">City National</span> to find cheaper ways of funding their loans.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">RBC’s executives, though, are not sweating it. “We’re feeling good about the outlook for the economy and for the bank," chief executive officer Dave McKay said on a conference call on Wednesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Investors that trust them could see big gains. “If RBC can in fact deliver, we believe there is meaningful upside for [its] shares as the bank continues to do a lot of the right things," Mr. Theriault, the analyst, said in his report.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Such rating cuts could affect the companies' ability to access credit to fund future growth and potentially increase what they pay to service their debt.</p>

"It's very unusual. I've never seen ... this disconnect between Canada and the rest of the world, unfortunately, because of the increase in supply and not sufficient enough expansion of takeaway capacity." DBRS last issued a similar warning in early 2016 after New York-traded West Texas Intermediate prices crashed to below $30 (U.S.) per barrel, he said, but a price recovery allowed most firms to escape being downgraded.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The recent drop in London-traded Brent and WTI oil prices makes the current problem even more acute for Calgary-based oil and gas producers, Vallance said, estimating that their credit ratings will deteriorate if discounts don't improve significantly in the next six months or so.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The province of Alberta has been urging the federal government to help it add 120,000 bpd. of train capacity but Ottawa has been reluctant to get on board.</p>

Increases in crude-by-rail were limited by the availability of locomotives and crews earlier this year but that has changed thanks to investments by both Canadian National and <span class="companylink">Canadian Pacific</span> railways, said John Zahary, CEO of Calgary-based Altex Energy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">His company is loading about 50,000 bpd. these days at its terminals in Alberta and Saskatchewan, up from 35,000 bpd. in March, but it has capacity to move 150,000 bpd., he said.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Albertans own their oil and gas resources, a fact enshrined in Canada's Constitution thanks to the leadership of the late former premier Peter Lougheed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As owners, Albertans need to know they can make choices that get our oil sector back on track.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While media reports focus on companies losing profits and governments losing billions of royalty and tax dollars, individual Albertans could be forgiven for thinking that they are passive victims of an economic disaster beyond their control.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Albertans, and all Canadians, are certainly victims. The federal government's failure to build pipelines means that, in some cases, Canada's energy is selling for 75-per-cent less than American oil and costing producers, Alberta royalty income and corporate tax revenue $100 million every day. U.S refineries are buying up Alberta's oil, dirt cheap, and turning it into full priced U.S. products and profits. Thanks to our failed energy policy, President Donald Trump's economy is benefiting from cheap Alberta oil.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The oil discount has left Alberta companies no choice but to shift capital investment south of the border. So not only do American refiners make billions in profits buying cheap Canadian oil and selling it at international prices, Canadian jobs are also exported to the U.S. as well.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Imagine if Canadian federal policy forced our beef farmers to charge American fast-food chains 75-per-cent less for Canadian beef but the price of American hamburgers never changed. Or if Ontario auto plants were forced to sell Canadian cars in the U.S. for 75-per-cent off while U.S. dealers kept the same sticker prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Canadians should be outraged at the federal government's energy-policy failure, doubly so when you consider that our oil and gas are our most valuable exports.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So, do Albertans need to be passive and watch as our No. 1 asset suffers under the weight of policy-driven price collapse? The answer is no.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We don't have to be victims, we can choose to act.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What should owners do if an incompetent manager puts the store's most important product on sale at a huge discount? End the sale. How do Albertans end the sale? The medium-to long-term answer is building pipelines and increasing oil producers'access to rail-transport capacity. But right now we don't have that much time on our side.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The immediate answer is cutting production to increase the value of our oil.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Without new pipelines, our oil is literally piling up in storage and driving the price down.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some might argue that government intervention is the wrong way to go, that we should always "let the market prevail." As a conservative, that's my default position, as well.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Alberta's current situation is different in two critical ways: First, the low price of oil is not driven by a lack of demand, it is driven by government's failure to permit new pipelines despite the stated political goal of getting Canadian energy to market. This failure is a form of market intervention by government. As with other interventions, it is creating winners and losers, as only a few oil companies have the additional refining capabilities to cushion the blow from the deep discount, while most other producers suffer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Second, a prolonged distortion created by government policy failure has created a loss of industry activity and is leading to industry consolidation that would not occur in a normal policy environment. Over the long term, this will reduce the number of companies operating in our province, reducing competition for Alberta's resources and, ultimately, could lower the long-term value of Alberta's energy reserves.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When markets cannot rebalance and deliver the benefits of competition, Albertans, as the resource owners, should act.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The simplest and most effective action is a government-mandated production cut requiring all producers to reduce the number of barrels they sell into the market. This would raise the price of Alberta oil. As premier, Peter Lougheed did it when the last prime minister named Trudeau was in power, and it's time Premier Rachel Notley did the same.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If Premier Notley mandated a 10-per-cent across-theboard cut in oil production, it would take approximately 45 days to see the price differential change in favour of Alberta taxpayers. That means that, in a matter of weeks, the price of Alberta oil could almost double.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Importantly, Alberta's Opposition Leader Jason Kenney, of the United Conservative Party, is offering his support to Premier Notley as she considers how to end the massive discount on Alberta oil. Kenney notes that "these resources belong to all Albertans." He is right. It is time for all Albertans to come together and do what is best for the entire industry, our province and our country.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To be clear, this type of government intervention should be time-limited and targeted. This is the only short-term solution that will benefit Albertans and the vast majority of Alberta's oil companies. It is the only way to stop the discounting of Alberta's oil and keep a diverse and competitive energy sector in our province. And it is the only way to get the sector back on track and stop the loss of billions of taxpayer dollars that belong to Canadians.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some have said that cutting production will undermine future investment in Alberta. Albertans should look at it another way. Investors want to put their money with smart owners. Will Albertans remain passive in the face of an economic crisis? Or will we act as owners, taking the reins and the steps necessary to protect the core of our national economy? The world is watching, it's time to act and end the fire sale on Alberta oil.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Which is why I was initially opposed to the idea of mandatory curtailment when it was first floated a few weeks ago.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Premier Rachel Notley also raised the alarm on the oil differential earlier in November when she appointed three expert envoys to find a solution.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the time, Western Canadian Select was selling at around US$45 a barrel less than Texas crude, causing a hit to the economy of about $80 million a day.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Kenney said as of Wednesday, Alberta oil was selling at about $12 per barrel, about $40 less than Texas crude. He also said the curtailment won't eliminate the $40 differential — just bring it down to around $20. Ultimately, pipelines to the coast are what's needed, he said.</p>

Canada's oil output is growing despite its pipeline problems[https://www.thestar.com/business/2018/11/27/canadas-oil-output-is-growing-despite-its-pipeline-problems.html]
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To help illustrate his point at the news conference, Kenney stood next to a clear container of Alberta oil with a label that read: 1L Alberta Oil 10 cents. Next to it was a bottle of water with a label, too: 1L Bottle of Water $2.89.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Our oil is worth about 10 cents a litre, a fraction of the cost of a bottle of water,” Kenney said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, Kenney said the energy leaders he has met with recently told him the industry is facing layoffs and that they're losing money.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Kenney's plan, being drawn up for introduction into the legislature, includes amending the Mines and Minerals Act “to define crude bitumen as petroleum.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Kenney wants to see oil production curtailed by 400,000 barrels per day, which is around 10 per cent of total production. This would have the effect of reducing the province's 35 million barrel surplus to about 17 million in a matter of weeks, according to Kenney's proposal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Smaller companies producing 25,000 barrels or less would be exempt, the limit would be temporary in order to cut down the surplus and up the price of oil, and there would be a sunset clause for a year from when the curtailment comes down.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Kenney said he wants enforced curtailment because while some producers have voluntarily stalled their production, some refused. He had previously called for voluntary curtailment by industry and stopped short of government enforcement.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">However, Kenney blames the differential on the federal government over how the quashing of the Trans Mountain pipeline expansion was handled, as well as Bill C-69, which sees the <span class="companylink">National Energy Board</span> dissolved and a new Impact Assessment Agency introduced.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The agency changes how new energy projects are reviewed, but Kenney calls C-69 the “no more pipelines bill.” Recently, Notley sent Environment Minister Shannon Phillips to Ottawa to ask the federal government to make changes to the bill.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Kenney, a self-proclaimed free market conservative leader and whose party is expected to mount the strongest challenge to the NDP in the 2019 election, said his proposal wasn't a political ploy to make his caucus look good leading up to the campaign.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He said he wanted to “thank the premier,” who arranged through Energy Minister Marg McCuaig-Boyd for him to speak with the three appointed envoys. He said they had a respectful and factual conversation on the issue and he presented his plan to them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“If the government agrees with, generally, this course of action ... they may vary from us on certain details, and that's fine,” Kenney said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We want to avoid this becoming a political football.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Kenney said he would be willing to prolong the current sitting of the legislature to ensure the amendment was passed before the house lets up in December.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">McCuaig-Boyd spoke to reporters following Kenney's announcement and said she found it interesting that “last week he was saying, let the free market take its course.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Part way through the week he said, 'Well, maybe voluntary curtailment.' Now today, he's saying this.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The minister said her government's team of experts is speaking with industry and she said leaders there are “quite divided on the curtailment issue.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">However, she said her government is “looking at all options right now. We have not closed the doors on any good ideas.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">McCuaig-Boyd said curtailment might work as a short-term solution, but she brought up the premier's announcement from Ottawa on Wednesday that her government would be investing in rail cars to move 120,000 barrels per day, and suggested that was a good medium-term solution.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The plan, currently under negotiation, would start in late 2019 and bring down the differential by about $4 per barrel, the government said in a news release.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Kenney didn't want to discuss rail cars, saying he needed to assess the details of the plan. He said that what he's hearing from industry is that they don't have a year to wait for rail cars.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We're going to have a lot of companies that don't make it a year (or) six months from now,” he said. “I've met industry leaders who are talking in the range, collectively, that there could be tens of thousands of layoffs in the first quarter of 2019.”</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CALGARY—The average amount of time Albertans spend unemployed has nearly tripled in the last decade, according to a new report from the University of Calgary's School of Public Policy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The report, released Wednesday, shows that in October 2018, an unemployed person in Alberta spent an average of 20.9 weeks before finding work again, compared to October 2008 when the figure sat at 7.4 weeks. This average rate has climbed higher and higher since February 2015, just after Alberta's economy was hit by declining oil prices.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The current duration of just under 21 weeks actually reflects a decline, since the rate hit a peak of 25.6 weeks in June 2017. Ron Kneebone, the University of Calgary professor who authored the study, said it remains to be seen how much this rate will continue to decrease.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Kneebone noted in Alberta's recovery from the 2015 decline in oil price so far, and its recovery from the 2008-09 recession, the average duration of unemployment never dropped to the levels they were before these economic crises.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Every time the duration of unemployment gets driven up, it doesn't come back to where it started. It tends to ratchet upwards, higher and higher,” Kneebone said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We have seen recovery over the last six months, the duration of unemployment is falling. But our experience from the past is that this is as far as it's going to fall.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Kneebone includes in his study that longer durations of unemployment have been associated with increased difficulty in finding work. He said that the longer people spend unemployed also means more people will need social assistance, indicating that many of the costs Albertans must bear because of low oil prices may not be fully realized yet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Kneebone added Alberta must look past the economy's headline numbers, like GDP growth or the unemployment rate. The number of people unemployed is a useful figure to monitor, but what's more important is how long Albertans are unemployed, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“If the unemployment rate goes up, but everyone who's unemployed is only unemployed for a week, that's a much different kettle of fish than if people are actually unemployed for 25 weeks,” Kneebone said. “You can imagine the second is a much more serious problem.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An important response to this issue, Kneebone said, is for the provincial government to focus on helping those who have been left out of Alberta's economic recovery so far. Oil sector workers who have been unemployed for long stretches should be encouraged to seek retraining now that it's unlikely their jobs are coming back, Kneebone said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“What you need to be doing as a government is target those who are having trouble finding re-employment,” Kneebone said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We have to decide, are we going to be satisfied with headline numbers and say, 'The economy seems to be growing, that's good. We don't have to do anything.' Or do we want to drill down and say, 'It's not good for everybody, some people are being left behind. Shouldn't we be targeting our support to them?' And I think we should.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Four years ago, Jackie Rafter helped start Higher Landing, a career transition service in Calgary that helps unemployed people get back to work. She said she's seen recent applicants who have been unemployed for as long as three years, who are sometimes very skilled engineers, geologists, geophysicists and other technical professionals from the energy industry.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“It's quite disturbing when you start thinking about the huge untapped reservoir of talent that we are sitting on in Calgary,” Rafter said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Rafter said it's more than just an economic issue for Alberta. She said many of these people have to adjust to finding work in a changing job market when they may never have had to spend much time in a decades-long career looking for work, which can be a difficult transition.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“It's not just economic. It's social, it's personal, it's health-wise. These are people who the longer they're out of work, their self-esteem starts to dwindle in addition to their resources,” Rafter said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Relationships break up, their health starts to suffer, there becomes all sorts of social problems that erupt within the family. So there's a tremendous trickle-down effect that's being caused as a result of prolonged unemployment.”</p>
