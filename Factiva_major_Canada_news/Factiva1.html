</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We're mad as hell and we're not going to take it anymore.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The rest of Canada owes us big time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Trudeau is deliberately wrecking our province.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Not exactly the smartest way to win hearts and minds across the country but anger has a way of blotting out intelligence.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Regardless, there certainly is a lot of explosive anger in Alberta these days. And a lot of people who should know better are willing to throw a match at it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The anger stems from frustration over stalled oil pipeline construction; pipelines that were supposed to ship Alberta's plentiful oil supplies to the United States and other export markets. They are in limbo mainly because of objections from environmental and Indigenous activists, which have been upheld by the courts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When combined with other complications in the U.S oil market it means Alberta's oil is fetching next to nothing compared to the usual benchmark prices. Understandably, this makes a lot of people mad because so many of them depend on a thriving oil industry for well paying work.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So it's not surprising that we have seen large protest rallies, especially when Liberal politicians are in the vicinity (always a handy target in Alberta), and noisy truck convoys in rural regions where the petroleum industry is the only game in town.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And, of course, we are hearing more from the separation bogey man who always seems to pop up at times like this.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But this time we have the elite, our so-called leading lights, leading the separation band wagon.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">First there was Brett Wilson, who raked in millions of dollars selling equities in oil and gas companies and went on to become a celebrity with CBC's Dragons' Den. Wilson took up the separation cudgel by tweeting[https://twitter.com/WBrettWilson/status/1071956218690756608] that although he wasn't a separatist, the Liberal party “was collaborating to push Alberta and Saskatchewan out of confederation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In other words: Alberta is so alienated and oppressed we might as well separate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Wilson has also absurdly tweeted[https://twitter.com/WBrettWilson/status/1079466046325633024] that Greenpeace and the <span class="companylink">David Suzuki Foundation</span> are guilty of treason because of their opposition to oil pipelines.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And then Jack Mintz chimed in[https://business.financialpost.com/opinion/jack-mintz-alberta-has-better-reasons-to-albexit-than-britain-did-for-brexit] with an op-ed in the Financial Post in which he declared that Alberta had a better case for exiting Canada than Britain does for exiting the EU.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mintz was the president and CEO of the C.D. Howe Institute at one time and then went on to become director of the University of Calgary's School of Public Policy. He is also sits on the board of <span class="companylink">Imperial Oil</span>. That would be the same <span class="companylink">Imperial Oil</span> that is a subsidiary of <span class="companylink">ExxonMobil</span>, the giant multinational that deliberately buried[https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/exxon-knew-about-climate-change-almost-40-years-ago/] early evidence of global warming due to carbon emissions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Whatever negatives Alberta would face are easily swamped by the positives that would come with separation,” Mintz wrote.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Jason Kenney, one-time federal Conservative cabinet minister and now leader of Alberta's official opposition, doesn't endorse separation. But he's happy to stoke the flames. Within days of the court ruling in August that put the brakes on construction of the Trans Mountain pipeline, Kenney told a national TV audience[https://www.ctvnews.ca/politics/separatism-may-be-on-the-rise-in-alberta-after-trans-mountain-decision-kenney-1.4081573] that he had never heard so many people in Alberta talk about separation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I am even hearing it from educated, urban professional women who are saying the country isn't working anymore … and I understand that frustration,” Kenney said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Naturally, those women were not identified.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Like Wilson, Kenney also has it in for environmentalists and has pledged to set up a “war room” to deal with them should he be elected premier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Wilson, Mintz and Kenney never explain how separation or threatening to withdraw Alberta's contribution to equalization payments would hasten pipeline construction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Thankfully, a recent opinion poll[https://researchco.ca/2018/12/20/alberta-separation/] indicates that the majority of Albertans don't buy into separation, which, if it were to happen, would leave most Albertans swamped while people like Wilson, Mintz and Kenney would remain high and dry.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Like many other people, they have all done well by Alberta.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Surely they could come up with a better solution for its current predicament than threats of separation.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Assessment of the Trudeau Government at Year End poll, conducted by Abacus Data, showed approval of the Trudeau government has sunk to 25 per cent among Albertans, compared with 42 per cent nationally.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a September poll, 34 per cent of Albertans approved of the same government.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Alberta has always been the place that (the federal Liberals) get the lowest positive numbers, but I think it has intensified over the last few months," said Abacus Data CEO David Coletto.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There's a lot of anxiety around the energy industry obviously in Alberta, and I think many in the province don't feel the federal government is an ally when it comes to promoting that industry and doing everything it can to get oil to places outside of the province."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">People across the political spectrum in Canada united in criticizing the Trudeau government's work on the Trans Mountain pipeline, with 42 per cent on the left and 55 per cent on the right giving the prime minister a "poor" rating on that particular issue.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pro-oil rallies have heated up over the past two months in Alberta, with hundreds turning out for gatherings across the province. Protesters have donned yellow vests and expressed anger about a range of issues, largely focusing on the federal government's inability to build pipelines to create oil jobs in Alberta. Some demonstrators have made displays threatening or joking about violence toward Trudeau, and some - including white supremacist group Wolves of Odin, which has been visible at the rallies and obtained a permit for at least one at the Alberta legislature - have expressed anti-immigrant sentiments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Abacus poll also includes some disturbing numbers about Canadians' views on social issues, indicating disapproval of Trudeau is linked to negative views of Muslims, people of colour, gay people and the news media.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Across Canada, disapproval of Trudeau is 25 points higher among those who say Canada would be better off "if there were no Muslims here," and 24 points higher among those who think Canada would be better off if it was "more white."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On gender issues, disapproval was 19 points higher among those "fed up with all the emphasis on promoting women's interests," and 14 points higher among those who say being gay is a choice that should be discouraged.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Disapproval of Trudeau is 17 points higher among those who think the news media "is the enemy of the people of Canada," and 10 points higher among those who think abortion should be illegal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Albertans scored the highest on those last two questions, with 32 per cent viewing media as the enemy of the people - compared with 27 per cent nationally - and 25 per cent believing abortion should be illegal, compared with 19 per cent nationally.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Abacus surveyed 2,000 Canadians aged 18 and over online between Dec. 13 and Dec. 18 for the poll. The margin of error for a comparable probability-based random sample of the same size is plus-or-minus 2.5 per cent, 19 times out of 20.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Penticton, B.C.'s Apex Mountain Resort had a slow start and a dwindling number of visitors compared to the last five years of “phenomenal” snowfall.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When snow finally fell in December, a cold snap sucked the moisture out of the snow and turned it into a sugar-like texture: a “non-consolidated base.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“So, if you stood on 50 centimetres of snow, your ski would go right to the bottom. Whereas 50 cm of snow that has fallen at -1 C is highly compactable,” he explained.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Similar challenges were also reported by Joffrey Coeman, director of sales and marketing at Cypress Mountain Resort in Vancouver.

Cities in Spain, Belgium, Scandinavia as well as France have taken dramatic steps to prepare themselves for a post-global-warming future. Cars will be banned from the downtown core of dozens of Spanish towns and cities. In Paris, Mayor Anne Hidalgo hopes to eliminate diesel cars by 2024 and gas-powered cars by 2030.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's what former Toronto mayor, Rob Ford, would have called a “War on the Car” — but taken to a whole new level. And Toronto, a city willing to tolerate the deaths of dozens of pedestrians and cyclists [https://www.thestar.com/news/gta/2018/12/07/toronto-appears-to-have-hit-a-one-year-high-in-pedestrian-and-cyclist-fatalities-over-40-per-cent-of-those-deaths-happened-in-scarborough.html]every year rather than crack down on drivers, couldn't be further behind.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And if cyclists weren't irritating enough, global cities across the U.S. and Europe, including the French capital, are now awash in e-scooters, not the kind kids use but electrified mini-vehicles that compete with cars, trucks, buses, motorcycles and bicycles for space on the roads and sidewalks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">E-scooter rental programs are so popular they have left cities in the dust. Yet again, technology has left civic officials scrambling to keep up[https://www.thestar.com/business/tech_news/2018/04/18/cities-frustrated-as-startups-scoot-around-municipal-vehicle-laws.html]. The knee-jerk response, of course, is simply to ban them. Obviously, though, the advent of e-scooters is another example of why cities — Toronto included — need a comprehensive transit strategy focused on mobility not how to preserve auto-domination.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, the failure of Toronto's Vision Zero road safety program[https://www.thestar.com/news/gta/2018/06/12/female-cyclist-killed-in-collision-at-bloor-and-st-george.html] has become a much more contentious issue than Toronto Mayor John Tory and his allies ever expected. It is a reminder that urban populations are ahead of local politicians in many respects and that civic leadership is a balancing act. Hidalgo's popularity has fallen lately primarily because of her efforts to cut car usage. On the other hand, almost two-thirds of Spaniards approve of the country's plan to reduce cars in downtown core of 138 towns and cities by 2025.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">No one would expect Tory to argue, as did Oslo's vice-mayor of urban development, Hanna Marcussen: “A couple of decades ago, it was perfectly normal to smoke inside. Today, very few would do that. I think it's the same with cars in the city centre. One day we will look back and ask ourselves why we ever thought that was a good idea.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Her argument is simple: “Half of Oslo's transport emissions come from private cars,” Marcussen explains. “So, to reduce these emissions, we need to encourage private households to buy electric cars. We need to improve our public transport system and have to make it easier to ride a bike in the city.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Toronto, which maintains a Trumpian silence on climate change[https://www.thestar.com/news/queenspark/2018/08/24/no-ban-on-the-words-climate-change-top-ontario-bureaucrat-says.html], is going in the opposite direction. The mayor's priority is not to get people out of their cars but to make getting around by car faster and more convenient. No surprise the city managed to add fewer than 10 kilometres of bike lanes last year. As a result, Toronto's future looks less assured than ever. If it isn't enough that we starve public transit, we've decided to spend more than a billion dollars [https://www.thestar.com/news/toronto-election/2018/10/05/tory-and-keesmaat-disagree-about-the-gardiner-expressway-heres-a-close-look-at-their-claims.html]to rebuild the east end of the Gardiner Expressway, against the advice of city staff. This sort of thinking doesn't bode well for Toronto's ability to cope with the change that lie ahead. Hundred-year storms happen every few years now, and each time the city closes down.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Equally troubling is Toronto's failure to ensure a sense of social and environmental responsibility in the development it permits. We build the way we drive — quickly and thoughtlessly. This lack of vision means projects are approved in a vacuum. No wonder Tory refused to debate on environmental issues [https://www.thestar.com/news/toronto-election/2018/10/05/john-tory-turns-down-environmental-debate.html]during the mayoral campaign. He had little to win and much to lose.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Assessment of the Trudeau Government at Year End poll[http://abacusdata.ca/assessment-of-the-trudeau-government-at-year-end/], conducted by Abacus Data, showed approval of the Trudeau government has sunk to 25 per cent among Albertans, compared to 42 per cent nationally.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“There's a lot of anxiety around the energy industry obviously in Alberta, and I think many in the province don't feel the federal government is an ally when it comes to promoting that industry and doing everything it can to get oil to places outside of the province.”</p>

</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pro-oil rallies have heated up over the last two months in Alberta, with hundreds turning out for gatherings across the province.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Protesters have donned yellow vests and expressed anger about a range of issues, largely focusing on the federal government's inability to build pipelines to create oil jobs in Alberta. Some demonstrators have made displays threatening or joking about violence toward Trudeau, and some — including white supremacist group Wolves of Odin, which has been visible at the rallies and obtained a permit for at least one at the Alberta legislature — have expressed anti-immigrant sentiments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Abacus poll also includes some disturbing numbers about Canadians' views on social issues, indicating disapproval of Trudeau is linked to negative views of Muslims, people of colour, gay people, and the news media.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Across Canada, disapproval of Trudeau is 25 points higher among those who say Canada would be better off “if there were no Muslims here,” and 24 points higher among those who think Canada would be better off if it was “more white.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On gender issues, disapproval was 19 points higher among those “fed up with all the emphasis on promoting women's interests,” and 14 points higher among those who say being gay is a choice that should be discouraged.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Disapproval of Trudeau is 17 points higher among those who think the news media “is the enemy of the people of Canada,” and 10 points higher among those who think abortion should be illegal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Albertans scored the highest on those last two questions, with 32 per cent viewing media as the enemy of the people — compared to 27 per cent nationally — and 25 per cent believing abortion should be illegal, compared to 19 per cent nationally.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Alberta is the most conservative province in the country, whether you're talking about socially or economically,” Coletto said, adding Alberta tends to be more religious than other provinces.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Alberta does consistently stand out in that way. Even though I think the province has changed over the last decade, particularly in the large urban centres, it's still a place that expresses more conservative viewpoints, or is more likely to, than other parts of the country.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Quebecers were most likely to hold racist views, with 29 per cent of those polled believing Canada would be better off if it was more white — compared to 22 per cent nationally — and 41 per cent believing the country would be better off without Muslims, compared to 25 per cent nationally.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On those questions, Alberta was in line with the national average.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nakita Valerio, an Edmonton-based writer and researcher on anti-Semitism and Islamophobia, said she was disappointed but not surprised that nearly a quarter of Canadians expressed anti-Muslim and pro-white views.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I wouldn't say that Canada is exempt from increasing divisive rhetoric that's coming from south of the border and within our own country, and particularly within our province,” she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Valerio said violent hate groups across Canada tend to centre their rhetoric directly on anti-Muslim, anti-immigrant, and pro-white nationalist sentiment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She said Canadians can fight back by reaching out to their neighbours, saying no to hate groups in their communities, and educating themselves and others to make society more inclusive and accepting.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">People should “absolutely advocate” at all levels of government for anti-racist policies, action plans, and legislation, she added.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The first thing to do is recognize that it's there and accept that it's there — it's an unfortunate reality — and then find the ways to move forward,” Valerio said. “And recognize that it isn't on Muslims, and it isn't on immigrants, and it isn't on non-mainstream Canadians to do this work. It's exactly on the people who have the privilege that can be leveraged to do that work.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Abacus surveyed 2,000 Canadians aged 18 and over online between Dec. 13 and Dec. 18 for the poll. The margin of error for a comparable probability-based random sample of the same size is plus-or-minus 2.5 per cent, 19 times out of 20. Data was weighted according to census data to ensure the sample matched Canada's population according to age, gender, educational attainment, and region.</p>

Mr. Skripal was a Russian double agent who had moved to Britain in a spy swap. British authorities blamed Russia, calling the incident a “hostile action” and moved to expel 23 members of the Russian embassy in London. Days later, Russia responded in kind, expelling 23 Britons. But this diplomatic war was not confined to just the United Kingdom and Russia. Canada got involved in the standoff and expelled four Russians who were trying to “undermine Canada’s security or interfere in our democracy,” in solidarity with Britain. Canada would also go on to deny visa renewals for three more Russian diplomats who had already left the country to bar them from returning. Diplomatic incidents such as this aren’t uncommon, but according to more than 180 pages of documents obtained by The Globe and Mail, Canada’s approach to the skirmish differed greatly this year. The Globe’s Grant Robertson reports [https://www.theglobeandmail.com/canada/article-embassy-games-inside-canadas-diplomatic-standoff-with-russia/] that Ottawa didn’t want to discreetly dismiss diplomats in an effort to avoid a public international spat, the path usually taken in instances like this. Instead, the federal government wanted to send Russia a message. E-mails show that senior Global Affairs Canada staff sought to denounce a “wider pattern of unacceptable behaviour by Russia,” not only the attack on the Skripals.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">TODAY’S HEADLINES</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Boris Birshtein has made powerful friends and millions of dollars as a middleman between the West and the fractured former USSR. But who is he really, and who does he work for? The Globe’s Mark MacKinnon followed his trail[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/canada/investigations/article-boris-birshtein-investigation/#map] – and ended up in a maze of geopolitics that includes everyone from a former deputy mayor of Leningrad named Vladimir Putin to a real estate developer named Donald Trump. We’ve also laid out the web of ties [https://www.theglobeandmail.com/canada/investigations/article-boris-birshtein-whos-who/] that includes world leaders, spies and mafia dons.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Canada’s green energy industry is beginning to shift[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/canada/alberta/article-canadas-renewables-industry-heads-to-alberta/] from Ontario to Alberta. The two provinces have taken different approaches to growing renewables. In Ontario, the government set rates under the now-scrapped <span class="companylink">Green Energy</span> Act while Alberta holds auctions to see which company can supply the market with the cheapest power. Although Ontario and Quebec remain the two largest producers of renewable electricity, Western provinces are gaining ground. Experts in the wind industry say the heart of the field is near the Crowsnest Pass.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Federal Liberals have nominated[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/canada/article-federal-ndp-leader-jagmeet-singh-to-face-karen-wang-in-byelection/] Karen Wang, a daycare owner, in the Burnaby South by-election, which will feature NDP leader Jagmeet Singh. Ms. Wang was a candidate for the BC Liberals in the 2017 election and will be running to replace former NDP MP Kennedy Stewart, who is now Vancouver’s Mayor.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The federal cabinet has approved [https://www.theglobeandmail.com/canada/article-trudeau-cabinet-approves-design-for-special-toonies-to-mark-75th/] designs for special toonies that will commemorate the 75th anniversary of D-Day. Around 14,000 Canadian soldiers were part of the Allied assault on Normandy in June of 1944. Cabinet has also approved a loonie that will commemorate the 50th anniversary of Parliament’s decision to decriminalize homosexual acts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sarah McIver, a teacher from Alberta who had been detained in China, has returned [https://www.theglobeandmail.com/canada/article-alberta-teacher-detained-in-china-arrives-back-in-canada/] to Canada after being released from custody. The Chinese government said that Ms. McIver was being held under “administrative punishment” because she was teaching English in the country illegally.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pro-pipeline protesters are planning a convoy [https://www.theglobeandmail.com/business/industry-news/energy-and-resources/article-pro-pipeline-protesters-plan-convoy-to-ottawa-in-february-to-back/] to Ottawa in February to demand action from the federal government to help the oil patch.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After a long-delayed election in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, doubts are growing [https://www.theglobeandmail.com/world/article-after-a-long-delayed-congo-election-doubt-about-a-peaceful-transfer/] about the peaceful transfer of power from President Joseph Kabila. Sunday’s vote was touted as a historic election, the first democratic transfer of power in the country’s history. Opposition parties, however, say that Mr. Kabila and his allies are behind the logistical chaos voters faced in an effort to retain power amid dismal projections by an independent poll ahead of the election.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping said [https://www.theglobeandmail.com/business/article-us-china-presidents-express-optimism-about-possible-trade-deal/] that progress was being made to deescalate the trade war between the world’s two biggest economies. Testy U.S.-China relations have shaken global financial markets for most of the year, with tariffs affecting hundreds of billions of dollars of trade flows.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Amid allegations of a rigged election, Sheikh Hasina, prime minister of Bangladesh, has claimed victory and is poised to rule for a third straight term. Ms. Hasina’s Awami League party won more than 280 seats in the 300-seat Parliament, according to the country’s election commission, while the main opposition party, the Bangladesh Nationalist Party, won just six seats. At least 17 people died amid violence on election day and reports allege ballot-stuffing and vote-rigging by the ruling party in the world’s ninth-most populous country.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Jean-Claude Juncker, the head of the <span class="companylink">European Commission</span>, said [https://www.theglobeandmail.com/business/article-eu-is-not-trying-to-foil-brexit-top-executive-jean-claude-juncker/] that the <span class="companylink">EU</span> is not trying to foil Brexit and that it is prepared to discuss future ties once <span class="companylink">Britain’s Parliament</span> approves the divorce deal.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Campbell Clark (The Globe and Mail)[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/politics/article-big-choices-big-surprises-big-milestones-canadians-seem-unfazed-by/] on a chaotic 2018: “The thing about 2018 isn’t that it was the first year of big events in Canadian politics. Jean Chrétien went through the 1995 Quebec referendum and Stephen Harper endured the 2008 global financial crisis. It’s that’s there were so many – big choices, big surprises, big milestones – that came so fast.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Donald Savoie (The Globe and Mail)[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/opinion/article-eastern-and-western-canadians-are-angry-and-ottawa-needs-to-wake-up/] on Canadian unity: “Threats to Canada’s federation are as old as Canada itself. But these threats are taking new forms. It is now less about Quebec’s place in the federation and more about growing regional frustrations in Western and Atlantic Canada over the workings of national political institutions. And, left unattended, these cracks could well threaten Canada’s unity.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Meghan Sali (The Globe and Mail) [https://www.theglobeandmail.com/opinion/article-canada-is-ripe-for-populism-and-our-telecom-oligopoly-is-the-reason/] on phone-bill populism: “unlike so many other pocketbook issues, we have yet to see any political party of the day claim this issue as their own. Despite big talk, inaction from Innovation Minister Navdeep Bains has only fuelled frustration. But the issue can’t remain apolitical. Given the ubiquity of outrage and disappointment over ever-rising telecom costs – and the deep mistrust[https://www.uvic.ca/gustavson/brandtrust/assets/docs/National-Full-Data-Set-GBTI18-BTRanking.pdf] of the companies that provide these services – the political appeal of promising to rein in these costs is obvious.”</p>

Taylor Owen (The Globe and Mail)[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/opinion/article-big-techs-net-loss-how-governments-can-turn-anger-into-action/] on regulating Big Tech: “This year was defined by outrage against tech – but 2019 will be the year that the long and messy process of governing it begins.”</p>

David Fraser (The Globe and Mail)[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/opinion/article-cancelling-canadas-contract-to-sell-lavs-to-saudis-could-be-an-avro/] on the Saudi LAV deal: “The fact remains that the work being done in Canada on the LAV project shows our allies that we have the ability and capability to produce high-quality equipment. If the <span class="companylink">Canadian government</span> cancels the project, talent and employment will move out of Canada. What will we be left with? A devastating loss of talent, expertise and scientific innovation that’s impossible to replace.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Adam Radwanski (The Globe and Mail)[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/canada/article-why-doug-ford-will-likely-be-a-major-2019-election-wild-card/] on Doug Ford in 2019: “One of the bigger wild cards in the coming year’s election campaign, Mr. Ford could be of help to Mr. Scheer – or considerable hindrance. And the federal Conservatives won’t have much control over which it is.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Globe and Mail Editorial Board[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/opinion/editorials/article-globe-editorial-for-reelection-in-2019-the-trudeau-governments/] on Trudeau’s year to come: “There are a number of issues that could hurt Mr. Trudeau in 2019. A big one is immigration. The government needs to demonstrate that the large number of irregular border-crossers, and the multi-year delays in deciding their cases, are not the new normal. The Liberals' less-than-urgent handling of this dossier suggests they are still banking on it resolving itself. They may get lucky. But if spring brings a resurgence in irregular crossings, voters could run out of patience. Another issue is pipelines. If the Liberals can get work started on the Trans Mountain expansion in British Columbia by next summer, it will be a win for them. If they don’t, it will hang over their heads at election time. But the government’s biggest liability remains Mr. Trudeau himself.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Vivek Goel (The Globe and Mail)[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/business/commentary/article-governments-must-invest-in-economic-industries-and-training-for-the/] on investing in the future: “Postsecondary and training institutions, employers and governments must promote emerging sectors and retraining to ensure new skills meet new market needs. Trying to turn the tide by saving jobs that are being overtaken by technology is not a winning strategy.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Nouriel Roubini (The Globe and Mail)[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/opinion/article-president-trump-is-the-dr-strangelove-of-financial-markets/] on Trump and Dr. Strangelove: “Mr. Trump is now the Dr. Strangelove of financial markets. Like the paranoid madman in Stanley Kubrick’s classic film, he is flirting with mutually assured economic destruction. Now that markets see the danger, the risk of a financial crisis and global recession has grown.”</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Somehow, when he recounted the big political events of 2018 at his year-end press conference, Justin Trudeau skipped over the fact that he bought an oil pipeline for $4.5billion.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In any other year, a prime minister couldn't even try to yada-yada over something that big.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But this was 2018, and he was able to rattle off a list of major events and hope that mention of the stalled Trans Mountain expansion could go missing between a new post-NAFTA trade deal and the legalization of marijuana.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sometimes it seemed as if Canadians were unfazed by a year that was chockablock with events that might normally be expected to shake our national politics.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Maybe that's partly because south of the border, U.S. President Donald Trump turned politics into attention-grabbing chaos. This time last year, Mr.Trump was threatening North Korea's Kim Jong-Un with war; six months later, he met the dictator at an upbeat summit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Events in the rest of the world, from recurring Brexit crises in Britain to “yellow vests" in France to Saudi hit squads killing journalist Jamal Khashoggi, could fill two new verses of Billy Joel's We Didn't Start the Fire.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet in this country, 2018 was a year replete with events that alone might have dominated Canadians politics in almost any other year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That new North American trade deal, struck on Sept. 30, was in fact the second major trade agreement Canada signed onto this year. It's almost forgotten that in January, Mr. Trudeau signed on to the rejigged TransPacific Partnership (an 11-member version, without the United States, of a deal then-prime minister Stephen Harper signed in 2015) after balking only months before.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The new North American freetrade agreement, called CUSMA by the <span class="companylink">Canadian government</span> and USMCA by Mr. Trump, was itself the culmination of highpressure threats from Mr. Trump that he would impose stiff tariffs on the Canadian auto sector that would devastate the Canadian economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Maybe Canadians aren't surprised now that the U.S. President would threaten to bring Canada to its knees – but in 2017 that seemed unthinkable.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The final deal itself was, admittedly, less momentous than once feared: Canada and Mexico made concessions, but it was <span class="companylink">NAFTA</span> with a haircut. It didn't clear up all of Canada's trade problems with the United States, including tariffs on steel and aluminum, but it was done.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Perhaps that's why Canadians didn't seem to have a strong reaction to a deal that once seemed like a make-or-break test for Mr. Trudeau's government.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">Nanos Research</span> polls showed only a little movement.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Public opinion also didn't seem to shift with a major cultural and legal milestone that Canadian politicians had mooted for decades: the legalization of marijuana. It was foreshadowed with hoopla from advocates and warnings from critics that the risks were too high and police weren't ready, but the political controversy died in days.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The only specific event that by itself had a truly discernible effect on Mr. Trudeau's popularity, in the view of pollster David Coletto, chief executive officer of Abacus Data, was the Prime Minister's gaffe-filled trip to India in February, which caused a sudden souring of Canadians' views of him.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That doesn't mean big events didn't have an impact. But in 2018, they sloshed up against each other. Pollster Nik Nanos said lingering anxiety over U.S.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">trade after the USMCA deal combined with the shutdown of the <span class="companylink">General Motors</span> plan in Oshawa, Ont., and the devastating glut that sank oil prices in Alberta to create economic uncertainty that probably caused an earlyDecember dip in Liberal popularity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And some big events kept rippling back in different ways.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Trudeau's Liberals spent much of the spring in a highstakes pipeline drama after <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan Canada</span> warned it might abandon the Trans Mountain expansion project. By May, the federal government spent $4.5-billion to buy the pipeline – seen then as risking B.C. support to save the project. In August, a court put the expansion on hold to fix flaws in the process. By October, a glut had driven the price of Alberta bitumen so low, and anger at the lack of a pipeline rose so high that many Albertans were nodding at conspiratorial assertions that the Liberals only bought the pipeline to prevent the expansion from going forward.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There was a stream of startling international surprises. In June, Mr. Trump left the <span class="companylink">G7</span> summit in Charlevoix, Que., taking to <span class="companylink">Twitter</span> to attack Mr. Trudeau.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In August, Saudi Arabia reacted with rage to a <span class="companylink">Canadian government</span> tweet, ordering its students to leave Canada while insisting Saudi business would be cut off.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In December, China reacted to the arrest of <span class="companylink">Huawei</span> executive Meng Wanzhou on U.S. charges with threats and the detention of two Canadians in China.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And there were notable events in party politics at home: in Ontario, the sudden rise of Doug Ford; in Quebec, the sidelining of the sovereigntist Parti Québécois; in the federal NDP, the low impact of new Leader Jagmeet Singh; on the right, Maxime Bernier, the second-place finisher from the Conservatives' 2017 leadership race chose to form a new, more conservative party.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The thing about 2018 isn't that it was the first year of big events in Canadian politics. Jean Chrétien went through the 1995 Quebec referendum and Stephen Harper endured the 2008 global financial crisis. It's that's there were so many – big choices, big surprises, big milestones – that came so fast.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Canada's green energy industry has shifted from Ontario toward Alberta, where a province best known for oil and gas production is now rapidly inking contracts for the country's cheapest renewable electricity.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">David Eva, the chief executive of Toronto-based Capstone Infrastructure, has seen his company's fortunes rise in Alberta. In mid-December, Capstone won a bid to build a 48-megawatt wind farm southeast of Calgary as part of a $1.2-billion round of renewable projects approved for construction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Alberta is leading the current opportunities within the country," Mr. Eva said. “There is a chill over additional development opportunities in Ontario right now, largely as the industry waits for direction."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Premier Doug Ford has sent Ontario's renewable electricity industry into a tailspin since taking office in mid-2018 by tearing up the province's green-energy policies and cancelling hundreds of projects.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the same time, Alberta has embarked on an aggressive campaign to source 30 per cent of the province's electricity from renewable sources by 2030.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Alberta has taken a different approach to growing its renewable industry from that adopted in Ontario, where a rapid increase in electricity rates led to significant public anger being directed against the former Liberal government.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Unlike in Ontario, where the government set the rates it would pay wind and solar producers under the now scrapped <span class="companylink">Green Energy</span> Act, Alberta has held competitive auctions in which companies bid to supply the province's deregulated electricity market with the cheapest power.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the latest round of bidding, won on Dec. 17 by Capstone, Toronto-based Potentia Renewables, Calgary's <span class="companylink">TransAlta</span> and <span class="companylink">Électricité de France</span>, the average winning bid was 3.9 cents a kilowatt hour for two decades of wind power.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That's near Alberta's current market price for electricity and nearly half the rate for electricity from Ontario's most recent renewable projects.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“This auction price was a lot lower than we had expected.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What we are seeing in Alberta is record-low prices for renewable electricity in Canada. Which confirms that Alberta has really good wind resources and the expertise to execute on those projects and deliver low prices," said Nick Martin, a policy analyst with the Canada West Foundation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Energy experts say the heart of Canada's wind industry is now near the Crowsnest Pass, where hundreds of new turbines are being built to harness the howling wind coming off the Rocky Mountains.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to Mr. Eva, other provinces will take note of Alberta's cheap prices: “It's a message that resonates across the country, not just in Ontario, but any province looking to add new electricity to the mix. They can't ignore that wind in Alberta is being done below 4 cents a kilowatt hour. It's clearly competitive with all other sources," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The other bright spot for the renewable industry in Canada is neighbouring Saskatchewan, where the province has committed to buying 50 per cent of its power from renewable sources by 2030.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ontario remains Canada's largest producer of renewable electricity, with Quebec a close second, but Ontario's green energy industry is in a holding pattern according to Sara HastingsSimon, a senior fellow at the Pembina Institute, a clean energy think tank.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“In Ontario you've had a real stalling on any forward movement," she said. “We've started talking about the different directions the two provinces are taking. Developers see the opportunity for wind development in Canada is focused in Alberta, and to a lesser extent in Saskatchewan, and they're shifting their focus there."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Earlier this year, the <span class="companylink">Ford</span> government cancelled 758 renewable power projects across Ontario which had been approved. The province's government also scrapped a large wind-power installation and then passed legislation forbidding the German company behind the project from suing the government to recoup costs, earning Ontario a rebuke from Germany's ambassador to Canada.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ontario's government says its moves will save ratepayers money at a time when the province is already awash in power. Ontario's new climate change plan, unveiled in late November, is largely quiet when it comes to new renewable power. The province isn't expected to require additional electricity generation until sometime in the next decade.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">Ontario Power Generation</span> has forecast that the price of power from refurbished nuclear plans in the province will be between 7 and 8 cents a kilowatt hour in the coming decades, twice the rate of Alberta's new wind power.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to Mr. Martin, Alberta is enjoying the benefits of good timing. The cost of wind power has tumbled and turbines have grown larger and more efficient thanks to the use of better data. Canada's green-energy sector, after years of subsidized rates in Ontario, has also accessed cheap capital and has gotten better at building wind projects on the cheap.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Alberta might want to thank Ontario for overpaying for those projects, because doing that helped with the learning needed to reduce prices for future wind and solar projects across Canada," he said.</p>

</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This year’s swift downturn in oil prices caught everyone off guard. Through the first three quarters of the year, U.S. and European crude benchmarks were on a steady upward trajectory. The global economic outlook was good enough to provide support on the demand side, while political turmoil in Venezuela and looming sanctions against Iran resulted in a supply gap. By the spring, traders and analysts began to speculate about the prospects of West Texas Intermediate rising to US$100 a barrel for the first time since 2014, and by the fall, that started to look possible as crude topped the US$75 mark. Then the supply-demand balance shifted dramatically. The United States softened its approach with Iran, global production spiked and the escalating trade war between the world’s two largest economies, the United States and China, stoked fears that global growth would suffer. Starting in late October, WTI futures fell for a record 12 straight trading sessions – part of a 40-per-cent slide that continued through the end of the year. Several strategists anticipate a more constructive backdrop for oil in 2019, although the outlook is highly dependent on a shifting economic, trade and monetary policy landscape.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Canadian dollar (CAD-USD)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The loonie didn’t have a chance this year. Two major drivers of the Canadian dollar – the price of Alberta crude oil and Canadian short-term bond yields against U.S. comparables – deteriorated to levels not seen since January, 2016, when the global oil recession hit its depths. The story behind Canadian oil is by now painfully familiar – the lack of pipeline supply combined with soaring oil sands production crushed the price of domestic crude to as low as US$13.46 a barrel in November. Bond yield spreads, meanwhile, widened as the <span class="companylink">Bank of Canada</span> was forced into a more dovish position, in large part because of the carnage in the oil patch. Those twin anchors dragged down the value of the Canadian dollar by nearly 8 US cents from a peak in early February. But it could have been worse. When conditions were similar three years ago, the loonie dropped to as low as 69 US cents, compared with about 73 US cents today. Why the resilience? Stéfane Marion, chief economist and strategist at National Bank Financial, suggested it’s because the economic outlook is more positive now, while investors might also be expecting the weakness in Western Canadian Select prices to be temporary. If they’re right on both counts, the Canadian dollar could be due for some appreciation in the new year, especially if the <span class="companylink">U.S. Federal Reserve</span> takes a pause in hiking rates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. tech stocks (Nasdaq Composite Index)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The second half of the year served as a remedial lesson in gravity. By midyear, the superhyped FAANG stocks – <span class="companylink">Facebook</span>, Amazon.com[http://amazon.com/] , Apple, <span class="companylink">Netflix</span> and <span class="companylink">Google</span> parent Alphabet – had reached the stratosphere, bestowing the world’s first US$1-trillion public valuation on Apple. As a group, their stocks were up by more than 60 per cent over the prior 12 months, leading the gains at the heart of the bull market. The same stocks were also the focus of the sell-off, posting an average decline of more than 35 per cent from their peak in June through the end of the year, and dragging the broader Nasdaq Composite Index into bear market territory. Beyond a reversion of the market’s biggest winners, the Big Tech narrative has also been tainted by <span class="companylink">Facebook</span>’s string of data-privacy controversies, as well as concerns that demand for Apple’s iPhones may have peaked. It’s difficult to find any consensus on the outlook for tech stocks going into the New Year. While valuations have improved, the earnings outlook is clouded by growing concerns for the economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Commodities (Bloomberg Commodities Index)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Energy hogged the spotlight this year, but for other commodities, almost all other commodities in fact, it was an absurdly bad year. Here is a list – by no means exhaustive – of the commodities in negative territory on the year: most precious metals, including gold, silver and platinum; every major base metal, from aluminum to copper to zinc to tin; and a range of agricultural commodities, including soybeans, coffee and sugar. This kind of synchronized decline in financial assets is most often accompanied by something like a recession in a major economy. “There has been no financial meltdown, no large sovereign or corporate has defaulted, and earnings growth has been decent. What gives?” <span class="companylink">Barclays</span> strategists said in a 2019 outlook. The metals sell-off appears macro driven, with investors retreating from markets as global trade tensions escalated, threatening to put a dent in global growth. Many strategists see decent demand-supply dynamics for several important commodities in the year ahead, although a reignition of the trade war could quickly wipe out any improvement in sentiment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Canadian banks (S&P/TSX Composite Diversified Banks Sub-Industry Index)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Big Six banks just had their worst calendar year since the financial crisis. The current losses are nowhere near as severe, of course, with the group down by almost 11 per cent this year, compared with 34 per cent in 2008. But any bad year for the banks is rare enough to be conspicuous. The performance of the bank stocks this year reinforced the importance of the energy sector to Canadian equities. In 2018, as in 2014, a downdraft in big bank stocks coincided with hard times falling on the energy sector. In addition, sentiment toward Canadian financials was further affected by trade friction between the United States and Canada, the correction in the housing market, and concerns over indebted households. And yet, the sector continues to churn out immense profits, with the Big Six generating a total of $45.3-billion in earnings in the 2018 fiscal year. For next year, there is not yet any reason to expect the banks won’t continue to deliver on earnings and dividend growth.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Chad Miller with the group Oilfield Dads told the crowd gathered in Rocky Mountain House that the province is suffering its "worst recession turned depression" in a generation due to weakened oil prices, exacerbated by a lack of pipeline capacity.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Numerous rallies and truck convoys have been held across Alberta and Saskatchewan in recent weeks to protest against federal actions that critics say will make building pipelines more difficult. Those include Bill C-69 to revamp the <span class="companylink">National Energy Board</span> and Bill C-48, which would ban oil tanker traffic on British Columbia's northern coast.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A convoy in Medicine Hat, Alta., last weekend attracted 650 vehicles, according to police, and groups are planning one in February that will travel from Western Canada to Ottawa.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Don't worry, you'll see us in February when we convoy to Ottawa!"</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Equity investors were subjected to a bumpy ride in 2018 and there's more - and likely worse - to come in 2019.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A remarkably long bull market in stocks seems at last to have lost momentum.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But stock in companies that are built to last will continue to reward the long-term investor, offering substantial total returns (dividend income and capital appreciation) at low risk compared with other asset classes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What follows are not stock recommendations, but equities worth checking out because they are best-in-class among worry-free "buy and hold" investments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A Royal understatement</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With a lofty return on equity (ROE) of 16.4 per cent in 2018, <span class="companylink">Royal Bank of Canada</span> outperformed most of its global major-bank peers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The latest average ROE of the top five U.S. banks, for instance, was 7.4 per cent. That is not an anomaly.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">RBC has grown its profits almost 40 per cent in the past five years, to $12.4 billion in 2018.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">RBC generates its outsized profits not by exotic means but with a stable, even prosaic, domestic retail banking operation that accounts for almost half its total profits.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">RBC is undervalued, however, because investors have been wary of large-cap bank stocks since the 2008 Wall Street meltdown and resulting Great Recession, triggered by the insolvency of some of the world's biggest lenders.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Today, investors also fret over trade wars, a cooling in the Canadian housing market, a troubled Alberta oilpatch, and near-record indebtedness among everyday Canadians.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But, like its biggest Canadian competitors, RBC began improving the quality of its loan book in the Alberta oilpatch back in 2014-16, during the collapse of the world oil price from more than $100 per barrel (U.S.) to about $26 (U.S.).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Oilpatch loans now make up just 1 per cent of RBC's loan portfolio. And in the current era of rising interest rates, RBC stands to further increase its profits from existing mortgage, credit card and other loans even without adding to its loan book, which of course it will do even with expected modest 2 per cent Canadian GDP growth in 2019.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Eventually major-bank stocks will cease to be out of favour with investors, and the 13.6 per cent discount at which RBC stock trades from its Jan. 1, 2018 peak will be erased.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Canadian Tire bulks up</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">Canadian Tire Corp. Ltd</span>. (<span class="companylink">CTC</span>) is one of those unusual firms that has become a conglomerate without losing its focus. <span class="companylink">CTC</span> has not strayed far afield with its acquisitions, as so many acquirers do, but instead used its takeovers to bulk up existing strengths, notably in auto supplies, sporting goods and outdoor apparel.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">CTC</span>'s new Triangle loyalty program enables customers to redeem their Canadian Tire "money" across far more products, and at the approximately 1,700 <span class="companylink">CTC</span> outlets, which include flagship Canadian Tire, <span class="companylink">CTC</span>'s stand-alone gas bars and its Mark's, PartSource, SportChek, National Sports and Nevada Bob outlets. <span class="companylink">CTC</span>'s decision to move <span class="companylink">CTC</span> "money" online should be an additional spur to sales growth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The firm's 76 per cent stake in CT REIT, a real estate portfolio of <span class="companylink">CTC</span> retail locations, is a reliable source of profit that helps smooth out the retail sector's notorious volatility.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This year's <span class="companylink">CTC</span> acquisition of Norway's <span class="companylink">Helly Hansen</span> (HH)gets <span class="companylink">CTC</span> the long-established HH line of premium-priced sportswear, a complement to Mark's midprice outdoor gear, plus a distribution network in more than 40 countries. HH gives <span class="companylink">CTC</span> geographic diversity to balance any softness in its home market, and it's a potential pipeline for <span class="companylink">CTC</span> private-label goods into new markets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An investor-friendly <span class="companylink">CTC</span> has bought back almost 20 per cent of its stock in recent years. And with a decent dividend payout of almost 3 per cent, <span class="companylink">CTC</span> has become an income stock without losing its upside growth potential. But despite consistent <span class="companylink">CTC</span> profit growth in a turbulent North American retail sector, <span class="companylink">CTC</span> stock trades at a 24 per cent discount to its August peak of $182. That value gap won't last long.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CN's fast-track growth</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Oil's pain is rail's gain" is a reality for Canada's two major railways over the next few years, as oil producers coping with pipeline bottlenecks turn increasingly to rail shipping. <span class="companylink">Canadian National Railways Co</span>. has an advantage over rival <span class="companylink">Canadian Pacific Railway Ltd</span>. as North America's only continental rail network, able to carry Alberta's landlocked heavy oil from Athabasca to refineries on the U.S. Gulf Coast. In one of its heaviest years for capital investment, CN already has completed 22 expansion projects in its network this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Increased crude shipments are a boost to already strong CN performance in its traditional freight, including grain, metals, minerals and chemicals. For investors watchful for chances to "buy on dips," CN's dismal third-quarter results have provided a buying opportunity for the most profitable of North America's Big Six rail companies. The Q3 peak in expenses from CN's ambitious capacity-expansion plan caused a deterioration in CN's best-in-class operating ratio (cost per unit shipped), and investors have yet to forgive.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Long-term, of course, CN's increased capacity will not only increase shipping volumes, but spread their cost over an expanded network, by which CN could realize its best operating ratios ever. But for now, short-term investors rule the stock price, currently trading at a discount of nearly 16 per cent from the stock's July peak.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Matched with CN's upside potential in revenue growth and efficiency gains is the railway's outstanding skill in cost control. Over the past four years, CN's revenue has grown 7 per cent while its total operating expenses are virtually unchanged from 2014, at $7.5 billion. Even greater future profitability, justifying a higher stock price, is assured over the next few years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A safe harbour in groceries</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Intensifying stock-market volatility in 2019 will drive more equity investors into "consumer defensive" stocks next year, and among those, <span class="companylink">Metro Inc</span>. is a gem.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The No. 3 Canadian grocer is bargain-priced, trading at just 6.2 times earnings, significantly cheaper than industry leader <span class="companylink">Loblaw Cos. Ltd</span>. (11.6) and No. 2 player Empire Co. Ltd., owner of Sobeys, <span class="companylink">Safeway</span>, IGA and other banners. Montreal-based Metro also outperforms its rivals, with a 2018 return on equity of 40 per cent, compared with Loblaw's 11.6 per cent and Empire's 4.3 per cent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Metro's upside potential has increased substantially with its acquisition last year of Quebec's <span class="companylink">Jean Coutu Group Inc</span>., Canada's second-largest pharmacy chain. Just as Metro successfully expanded beyond its Quebec base with its purchase and upgrading of Ontario's Dominion Stores and A&P stores, Coutu can use Metro to piggyback into Ontario by operating pharmacies in Metro stores outside Quebec. Metro is already stocking Coutu private-label goods, and Coutu now carries Metro house brand food, a collaboration that strengthens the firm against intensifying competition from <span class="companylink">Walmart</span>, <span class="companylink">Costco</span> and <span class="companylink">Amazon</span>-owned <span class="companylink">Whole Foods</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite the considerable size of the Coutu purchase, at $4.5 billion, Metro is sufficiently well financed to buy back as much as 2.7 per of the firm's outstanding shares by November 2019. And in October, Metro boosted its quarterly dividend by almost 11 per cent, to $0.18 per share, making for an attractive dividend yield of 1.6 per cent at the current stock price. Value investors might balk at Metro stock trading near its all-time high - it has been one of the best-performing retail stocks in 2018. But the market still hasn't fully accounted for the cost-efficiency and cross-selling potential of the 1,300-plus-stores Metro juggernaut.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Value in the oilpatch</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A troubled Canadian oilpatch might seem an unlikely source of value stocks. But Calgary-based <span class="companylink">Suncor Energy Inc</span>. qualifies as a buy-and-hold stock. Suncor is an integrated oil company, with upside potential from a recovery in oil prices and risk moderation from its formidable downstream operations, including refineries and a retail network of more than 1,500 filling stations. Suncor is also one of Canada's largest wind-power operators.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A well-capitalized Suncor was able to take advantage of low acquisition prices during the oil-price slump to buy complete ownership of its flagship production operations, so that its 2020 production, at a forecast of 900,000 barrels per day, will come close to doubling its daily production from the mid-2010s. Suncor has also cut its production costs from more than $35 a barrel to the $25 range.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That explains a Suncor profit that has soared by just over 40 per cent in the past five quarters. Suncor has a strong balance sheet, with $2.3 billion in cash reserves and access to a further $3.7 billion in credit arrangements. That strength has enabled Suncor to maintain its share-buyback plan which will return about $3 billion to shareholders by April 2019. In contrast to the many energy firms that have cut dividends in these difficult times, Suncor has maintained its record of consistent dividends of the last 16 years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The dividend payout has almost doubled since 2013, to a current annual $1.44 per year, for a current handsome yield of 3.8 per cent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Trading at a 37 per cent discount to its value earlier this year, Suncor stock at a current $35 is among the most attractive options for investors with faith in an oil-price recovery.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The year of wake-up calls. That's how 2018 is likely to be remembered.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We rudely discovered that a lot of the supposed realities we took for granted were nothing more than idealistic illusions. And the phone didn't ring just once. It rang several times.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The first call came May 29, when Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced the federal government would buy the Trans Mountain pipeline from <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span>, thereby confirming that Ottawa's entire energy policy was a colossal flop.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ever since being elected, the Liberals seemed to genuinely believe their sunny ways outlook on the world would translate into some kind of social contract between environmentalists and the energy industry that would allow Canada to both have its cake and eat it too.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To that end, they killed off Northern Gateway by banning oil tanker traffic off the northern B.C. coast and effectively shut down <span class="companylink">TransCanada</span>'s ambitious and sensible Energy East project by imposing tough new regulatory requirements. With Keystone XL caught up in the labyrinth of U.S. politics and courts, only Trans Mountain offered a viable option for getting Alberta crude to tidewater. Putting all the eggs in one basket, as it were.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It should have been a slam dunk. <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span> already had a pipeline to the Vancouver area; all they wanted was to twin it. But then B.C. had an election. The NDP narrowly won and took power with support from the Green Party. Trans Mountain, already facing intense opposition from environmentalists, some Indigenous groups and local politicians, morphed into a political faceoff between two western provinces with Ottawa caught in the middle.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The announcement the feds would buy out <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span> and build the pipeline themselves was supposed to resolve the issue. It didn't. The courts intervened, ruling that the approval procedure was flawed and ordering new consultations and a report on the effect of increased tanker traffic on whales. The whole process came to a shuddering stop, and no one knows when, or if, construction will resume.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The result of all this prevarication is an oil glut in Alberta. The spread between West Texas Intermediate crude and Western Canada Select rose to its highest level in history as companies kept pumping oil that had nowhere to go. Alberta was finally forced to curtail production in response.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A few years ago, Canada was being touted as a new oil superpower, whose energy industry would help support the economy for decades to come. That dream has been rudely shattered.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The second wake-up call came just a couple of days later, on May 31. That was the day President Donald Trump announced he was imposing tariffs on steel and aluminium exports from Canada in the name of "national security."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We were shocked. Until then, we had always thought of the U.S. as not just our number one trading partner but our closest ally. Our soldiers had fought alongside their troops in many wars. We had generally supported U.S. foreign policy (the Iraq War being an exception). We had a "special relationship" with Washington - or so we thought. Then, suddenly, we were branded a security risk. Canada's Foreign Minister, Chrystia Freeland, called the rationale behind the tariffs "absurd," and Ottawa moved to impose tit-for-tat retaliatory taxes on not only U.S. steel and aluminium but a range of other products as well.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many people assumed the U.S. move was simply a negotiating ploy by the president to win concessions for a revised <span class="companylink">NAFTA</span> deal. But the new treaty, called the USMCA, has now been signed (but not ratified) and the tariffs remain in place. Trudeau said in year-end interviews his government is working hard to get rid of them. If they're making any progress, it's not evident. At least for as long as Donald Trump is in power, Canada and the U.S. are no longer best pals.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The third call came on Nov. 26. That was the day <span class="companylink">General Motors</span> announced it would close its plant in Oshawa by the end of next year, along with four operations in the U.S. The shock stunned not just Oshawa but all Ontario. Automobiles have been the cornerstone of the province's manufacturing industry for a century. Now GM said it would shut down its key facility and no pleas, subsidies or legislation would change its mind. The automotive industry is heading in a different direction, with electric vehicles and driverless cars. Oshawa didn't fit with such disruptive changes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That raised the obvious question - what about the rest of Ontario's auto sector? Is Oshawa just a prologue to the winding down of an entire industry? For as long as we can remember, cars have been the bedrock of Ontario manufacturing. That's another myth that may be on the way out.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We're on the cusp of entering 2019. What wake-up calls will the New Year bring? Stay tuned.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Canadian oil industry could be in for another turbulent year in 2019, depending on how some pivotal events pan out.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Government-mandated production cuts and the potential startup of a key crude pipeline are among key developments to watch for next year. Here's a look at each one:</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While the announcement of production curtailments by Alberta Premier Rachel Notley has succeeded in lifting Canadian crude prices from record lows even before their implementation starts next month, the province's ability to wind down that policy without crashing the market will be crucial.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The province has said it only expects the full 325,000-barrel-a-day output cut to be in place for the first three months of the year, while the amount of oil in storage is drawn down to historical levels. The government will then work to match production with transportation and storage policy, reviewing the levels every month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The province's ability to extricate itself from the curtailment system depends partly on more rail-shipping capacity becoming available in the second half of the year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Producers have struck contracts to ship more crude by rail next year, with <span class="companylink">Cenovus Energy Inc</span>. announcing three-year agreements that cover about 100,000 barrels a day of capacity. Alberta also is buying rail cars that will help ship an additional 120,000 barrels a day.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Whether manufacturers and rail companies can supply all that equipment - and the people to operate it - in a timely fashion will be key to the success of those plans. The province's plan alone will add 80 locomotives and more than 7,000 cars.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The fourth quarter is when Canada's oil patch finally expects to get a taste of relief from its perpetual pipeline woes. That's when Enbridge's expansion of its Line 3, which is designed to ship an additional 370,000 barrels a day from Alberta's oilsandsto come into service. The timeline for other pipelines is both further out and less certain.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But even while Line 3 has all of its major regulatory approvals in hand and construction has been completed in Wisconsin and is more than halfway done in Canada, hiccups are still possible.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That was because I was in San Francisco for the official launch of the e-tron, which <span class="companylink">Audi</span> executives suggested would be the first of a string of electric or electrified vehicles the company plans to build. By 2025, they said, <span class="companylink">Audi</span> expects to be selling 800,000 electric cars and/or plug-in hybrids - about a third of the automobiles it produces each year.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I heard everything there was to hear about the new e-tron, about how the all-wheel drive, mid-size SUV that seats five can go more than 400 kilometres on a single charge (making range anxiety "a thing of the past," according to one executive), about how it can go from zero to 100 km/h in 6.6 seconds, has a top speed of 200 km/h and can tow up to 1,800 kilograms.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And so-on. In short, I learned a lot about the car. I finished my essay by writing that I hoped to get to drive the e-tron some day.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Well, that day came just before Christmas in - are you ready for this? - Abu Dhabi, the capital of the United Arab Emerits. (I repeat: Have I got a great job, or what?)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The San Francisco unveiling was what the industry calls a "global launch" and the Abu Dhabi road test was called a "global drive." You are a very fortunate automotive journalist, indeed, to be invited to both.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the drive is the real prize. Yes, it's wonderful to be among the first to see a new car but to be among the first to put it through its paces tops every reporter's wish list.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now, before I tell you about how the car handles (hint: it's a pleasure to drive), and about the UAE, and about how we got stuck in a sand dune and all sorts of other interesting stuff, here is some more pertinent information about the e-tron.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It will be in <span class="companylink">Audi</span>'s Canadian showrooms some time in the second quarter of 2019. Pricing starts at $90,000 Canadian. If, after reading this review, you absolutely must have one, go to audi.ca and it will tell you how to place an order.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When you get to the company's website, though, you will notice something about the photo of the car that's there - the rear-view mirrors don't look like any rear-view mirrors you have seen before. And that's because you haven't, because they aren't rear-view mirrors at all; they are cameras.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">Audi</span> is bullish about this particular feature because the almost-flat mountings containing the cameras - which transfer exterior images onto interior screens on the inside of the front doors - cut down on wind resistance and drag and can add more than two kilometres to the car's range.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">However, they are, at present, illegal in Canada and most U.S. states. <span class="companylink">Audi</span> is lobbying to have the law changed but I would suggest they not spend a lot of time trying because this is one e-tron feature I flat-out didn't like. I had to ask Michael Bettencourt, my co-driver, to move his hands once so I could check the right-side view and when I did see the monitor unimpeded, the glare from the sun coming into the car made it useless. The driver's side monitor was too close for me to really see what it was showing. Give me two outside mirrors any time. And two-plus kilometres in range doesn't impress me much.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Here are some other specifics:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The battery system, which is liquid-cooled to ensure best performance, can store up to 95 kW/h of energy and is flat between the two axels underneath the passenger department. A sheet of aluminum across the bottom protects the battery if stones should get kicked up while driving or you get stuck in a snowbank (or, as happened to us out in the desert, a sand dune).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The car is driven by two electric motors (one on each axle) and has 300 kW and 664 Nm (489.7 lb.-ft.) of torque in boost mode.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If you have an electrical plug in your garage, either a 120v or 240v, the e-tron will take 10 hours to charge but you will be good to go for - the company says - about 400 kilometres. Under normal driving conditions, that means you won't have to worry about stopping during the day to get a boost.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If you want to spend about $1,000 to have a fast charger installed in your garage, it will only take between four and five hours for the car to fully charge. If you want to drive to New York City for a vacation, though, you will have to stop at charging stations along the way and it will take about a half-hour every time to reach 80 per cent of capacity after you plug in.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Speaking of taking a vacation, the e-tron has 660 litres of cargo space. The SUV itself is 4,901 millimetres long, 1,935 mms wide and 1,616 mms high.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Inside, the driver has two interactive touch screens available, one for infotainment and the other for driver assists and other technology. I particularly liked the three-button shifter on the centre console with park, reverse and drive right under your thumb.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The interior is attractive and functional, as you would expect in a $90,000 vehicle. I'm a big guy and bopped my head once getting into the passenger side. But once bitten, twice shy and that didn't happen again. Inside, the e-tron feels really roomy and although Bettencourt and I didn't get into the back seat together, we would not have been in each other's way if we had.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now, about the drive.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We landed at the Abu Dhabi airport after dark (it's the capital of the Emirates on the shore of the Arabian Gulf). As we were shuttled to the hotel, the tour guide pointed out the red roof on the Ferrari World theme park off in the distance but I was more interested in the huge <span class="companylink">Ikea</span> store we drove past, and the Popeye's chicken and <span class="companylink">Burger King</span> signs. It seems you can't go anywhere in the world any more without being exposed to Big Business.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of course, there weren't any Esso, <span class="companylink">Sunoco</span> or <span class="companylink">Shell</span> signs at the gasoline stations. The <span class="companylink">Abu Dhabi National Oil Co. (ADNOC) </span>is king in the Emirates and Abu Dhabi itself sits on 97.8 billion barrels of oil that represent the world's seventh-largest proven reserves of the black gold. (Which means it was kind of a gutsy move on Audi`s part to launch an all-electric car here ...)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Interestingly, although there were lots of service stations, most had lineups at the pumps. I don't know the percentage of households that own cars but it's safe to say that just about everybody has one. There is public transit (a bus system; no subways - for obvious reasons) but the car is top dog in this part of the world.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is a Muslim country but there is no doubt the welcome mat is out for all cultures - tourists as well as expatriates, who make up more than 80 per cent of the people working in Abu Dhabi.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Our second hotel (we had rooms in two) had a huge Christmas tree and other decorations in the lobby and signs announcing that the "best Christmas brunch in the Ermirates" would be served on Dec. 25 for $24.95 (U.S).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Our first stop on Drive Day (as I called it) was a place called Masdar City, which is not far from Yas Marina and the Abu Dhabi Formula One Grand Prix circuit. It is a public/private project in which experimentation to make sustainability a way of life is being conducted. Research and development into solar and wind energy, the use of seawater for agriculture and the feasibility of city cooling powered by geothermal energy are among the experiments currently being conducted.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What better place, then, to start the all-electric vehicle drive, which took us on superhighways, side roads, off-roads and through city streets? Other than the irritation of trying to see behind the <span class="companylink">Audi</span> via the rear-view cameras (I think I used the normal-position rear-view mirror more than I have in years), I found the e-tron a delight to drive - particularly out in the boonies where the speed limit on the superhighway was 160 km/h.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now, although Mr. Bettencourt, my co-driver, says he didn't notice this when he was behind the wheel, I found that the e-tron seemed to strain a bit - a wee bit, but a bit nonetheless - going from 150 up to 160 km/h. Going from zero to 140-150 was no problem and, in fact, was an effortless dream, but then I detected a slight reluctance to go faster.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Which is no big deal in any event. I do not drive on highways where there is such a high speed limit. In fact, in Ontario, where I live, the maximum on the 400-series highways (expressways) is 100 km/h. More than 120 is pushing it in the eyes of the law so the fact that the <span class="companylink">Audi</span>, in my opinion, was not as snappy above 150 should be of no concern.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One other thing I noticed. At one point, I thought I heard a siren off in the distance. I have acute hearing and can often hear a siren in the city before others in my car become aware. So I said to Bettencourt, "I wonder what that siren's for?" And he said, "What siren?" And we both got a laugh when we figured out that when you are pulling away from a stop sign, or out of a rest area, or wherever from a standing start, and you haven't floored it but are accelerating up at a reasonable pace, that the sound of an e-tron electric motor, which is not silent but almost, can sound a bit like a weak siren.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Over the course of the day, we took that SUV up hill and down dale. We went to the top of Jebel Hafeet, the highest point in Abu Dhabi, and down again. Bettencourt was driving when we went up and he's a very experienced test driver and so was not - shall we say - slow on the ascent. The car performed flawlessly throughout the twisty, steep climb.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I drove going down (which was great for him, because the best views are when you descend) and the vehicle added kilometres to our range because the e-tron's recuperation system kicked in.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We were told that up to 30 per cent of the distance travelled can be recovered and that was not far off. Energy is recovered and put back into the battery either by me, the driver, lifting my foot off the throttle and coasting, or by hitting the brakes, at which point the motors on the axels become generators and convert the kinetic energy back into electrical energy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's really neat to watch the range indicator increase, rather than the other way around. And that's not the only time recycling is featured in the e-tron. For instance, excess heat from the electronics is sent back to the climate-control system, where it contributes to the heating or cooling of the vehicle.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In normal conditions, such as driving in the GTA, you can key into the navigation system where you want to go and the e-tron will take you there via the nearest charging station(s). The route planner calculates not only how much electricity is in your battery but the density of traffic so that when it estimates how long it will take you to go from A to B, it takes just about everything into consideration.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These weren't normal conditions. It turned out that although everything we had heard about the e-tron being able to go about, even more than, 400 kilometres on a single charge, we had, in fact, only about 375 km of range when we started our drive in the desert where the temperature was above 20C. (It makes you wonder, then, how the e-tron will be affected by the January-February Canadian cold, when electric vehicles lose range naturally.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In any event, we finished with about 27 km of range remaining and might have had more except for an unplanned off-road excursion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bettencourt and I were following directions - we thought - when we found ourselves slightly disoriented. We had gone off a superhighway and had driven through a camel gate (yes, camels wander around Abu Dhabi much like cattle in Alberta) and found ourselves staring straight at a sand dune. There were fresh tire tracks up and over the dune and so we figured, well - that looks to be the route.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In fact, a fellow in a red pickup truck was supposed to have been there to tell us to jog left and around the dune but he was nowhere to be seen. We later learned he'd fallen ill and had to leave.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In any event, my friend Michael Bettencourt took a deep breath and hit the throttle and we went about five feet through the sand before the car sank down to its axels. Pretty much like a stone. So there we were, a couple of Canadians, out in the middle of nowhere, in the desert, in Abu Dhabi, and we were stuck.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">S-T-U-C-K.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This could prove to be embarrassing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But just like Canada in the winter time, when people go off the road and get stuck in a snow bank, people stop to help. And before we knew it, five Arab men had pulled up and pushed us out of that sand. Only one could speak a little English and wanted to know where we were from. "Canada," we said. "Ah, Canada," he said, breaking into a smile.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It warms the cockles of your heart to see a smile like that when all you do is say the name of your country.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And then they were gone and we were on our way. It was only later, when I was looking at my notes of a briefing we'd been given the evening before when we'd first arrived, that I saw something that I'd written down and underlined. It said:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Do not drive into deep sand. Always stay on solid ground."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One last thing. Right now, at this very minute, there are no quick chargers at charging stations in Canada capable of powering up an <span class="companylink">Audi</span> e-tron to 80 per cent capacity in 30 minutes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The good news is that by the time the company starts to sell the cars in Canada, in the second quarter of 2019, there should be some along Highway 401 between Windsor and Quebec. They will be installed by Volkswagen Group Canada, which has created a company called Electrify Canada.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By the end of 2019, <span class="companylink">Audi</span> says, a total of 32 charging-station sites, with between six and eight charging stations at each site, will be operational in Ontario-Quebec and Vancouver-to-nearly-Calgary.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It will be a good start to servicing a great car, with more like it coming from <span class="companylink">Audi</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Engine: Fully electric drive system with one electric motor on the front axle and one on the rear axle including motor boost and efficient cooling system</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A strong majority of Manitobans think marijuana legalization hasn't been the cannapocalypse after all — far from it.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In fact, more than seven in 10 believe the process of reforming Canada's weed laws has gone “fairly well" or “very well" since legalization on Oct. 17, according to a Probe Research poll of 1,105 Manitoba adults for the Winnipeg Free Press.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“My impression has been that Manitobans have come quite far, really, on this issue of legalization in the last 18 months, two years," said Probe senior researcher Mary Agnes Welch.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“But even I am a bit surprised by how many people feel like this was kind of no big deal."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Less than 18 months ago, Manitobans had plenty of pre-legalization concerns. An August 2017 Probe online survey for <span class="companylink">CTV</span> News found Manitobans were generally “uncomfortable with key aspects of the looming legalization of marijuana," expressing concern over everything from the legal age to use the drug to the idea that their kids could choose it over alcohol.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The new poll numbers suggest approval of legalization in Manitoba goes well beyond people who regularly use cannabis. Even though nearly 71 per cent of Manitobans now take a favourable view of legalization, a similar proportion — 73 per cent — don't plan to purchase pot.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Twenty-seven per cent said they plan to purchase cannabis, or already have, in response to the survey conducted in late November and early December.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Clearly, the crowds in the stores demonstrate that there is a market out there, and I think this data also shows that," Welch said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Maybe it's a little higher in these numbers than the past, but we're also seeing, I think, more people being willing to acknowledge that they have used cannabis or that they plan to. So maybe we'll see that number go up a bit as the stigma declines."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Twelve per cent of Manitobans polled were willing to say they bought cannabis since legalization. A closer look at those purchasers suggests good news for both the federal and provincial governments, both of which want to use legalization to stamp out the black market for the drug: cannabis users in Manitoba appear to be choosing the new, legal market over the illicit alternative.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Eleven per cent of all Manitobans reported buying marijuana from a licensed retailer, more than double the five per cent who bought from an unlicensed source.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some respondents said they got marijuana from both legal and illicit sources, so those two figures overlap.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's encouraging that Manitobans appear to prefer the legal market, said Delta 9 Cannabis CEO John Arbuthnot, especially in light of an inconsistent supply at stores in the province.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I think it speaks, as well, to what we've been assuming all along, and that is that Canadians, overall, want to be legal," said Arbuthnot, whose company both produces government-regulated marijuana in an east Winnipeg facility and sells it at a provincially licensed store in St. Vital.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“They want to go through legal channels, they want to go to a store and find product that's tested and safe and approved."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Arbuthnot said Delta 9's Winnipeg store hosts as many as 700 shoppers on an average day, with closer to 1,200 transactions on a busy day.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Only about 10 per cent of Delta 9's cannabis sales occur online, a proportion he thinks will increase over time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Since prohibition is over and legalization is here, we've always anticipated that there would be a lot of popularity for this product, which there certainly is," said Matt Ryan, vice-president of marketing for National Access Cannabis, which holds seven of Manitoba's 16 legal cannabis store licences under the name Meta Cannabis Supply Co., and operates 14 NewLeaf Cannabis stores in Alberta.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ryan said his company's stores are seeing “trends very similar to alcohol, where Thursdays, Fridays and Saturdays are hot days for cannabis."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of course, not everyone in Manitoba is thrilled with the rollout.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Twenty-nine per cent of respondents felt legalization had gone “not very well" or “not well at all." Those people were more likely to live outside of Winnipeg, more likely to be older and male and more likely to support Brian Pallister's Progressive Conservative government.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I think political ideology really underpins that group of people who say it's not gone well," Welch said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The poll's findings bear out her analysis, since survey participants were asked to rank possible reasons to explain their take on legalization. For example, among the 29 per cent of Manitobans who felt legalization has gone poorly, 40 per cent said their top reason was simply that legalization was a bad idea. An additional 16 per cent ranked that as their second or third reason.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other Manitobans were most disappointed in legalization for reasons related to public health and safety. Fifty-six per cent of respondents who said legalization hasn't gone well cited concerns about impaired driving as one of their top three reasons, which was highest among women and older Manitobans.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I think there is still a significant worry — and I bet it's even a worry among people who generally support legalization — there is this lingering worry about impaired driving," said Welch.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“It's a legitimate worry."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That hasn't been borne out on the road, RCMP say.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Since legalization, Manitoba RCMP has not seen any increase in cannabis-impaired driving," Cpl. Julie Courchaine said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“However, we have seen several charges under the Highway Traffic Act for improper storage of cannabis in a vehicle."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Winnipeg police aren't willing to say yet what the experience has been in the city. In November, impaired-driving countermeasures co-ordinator, Const. Stephane Fontaine, said it takes months to confirm drug-impaired driving arrests for statistical purposes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even some Manitobans who presumably use cannabis were of the opinion that legalization hadn't gone well. Twenty-two per cent of respondents who took a dim view of legalization cited “not enough product available" as one of their top reasons, and that response was highest among respondents aged 18 to 34. Twenty-one per cent said legal cannabis was “too expensive."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Welch cautioned that those figures represent small sample sizes, and could be less reliable.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“There have been stories from across the country about supply shortages, so I don't think it's an isolated, Manitoba issue," Arbuthnot said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I was in store (recently) and we had about 15 different cannabis products and two oil-based products. Ultimately, we'd like to have 60 or 70 cannabis products at any given time, so obviously there's still a lot of work to do to get to a point where stores are... well-stocked, with a broad enough selection of (inventory) that you're satisfying everybody."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Probe Research poll for the Winnipeg Free Press used random-digit dialing to reach adults across Manitoba, who answered the survey questions online from Nov. 27 to Dec. 6. The representative sample of 1,105 Manitobans included 251 randomly chosen members of the Probe Research panel. The survey results have a 2.9 per cent margin of error, 19 times out of 20.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The year 2019 will decide whether Premier Rachel Notley's NDP gets to finish the job of getting more oil to market or become the first party in provincial history to be one and done.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I know that the opposition wants to sort of revel in what they insist on hoping is defeat, but we've made more progress on getting a pipeline to tidewater than any other government has in the last 70 years," Ms. Notley told The Canadian Press in a year-end interview.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Notley will take voters to the polls in the spring after a 2018 that saw her tightly wrapped in the Gordian knot of the Trans Mountain pipeline expansion. It got a green light two years ago and would triple the amount of oil moving to the B.C. coast and, from there, overseas where it could fetch a better price. Ms. Notley, while fighting court challenges and the B.C. government over the project, pulled it back from the abyss after the pipeline's owner started questioning whether it would ever get built. She got the federal government to buy it for $4.5-billion No sooner had the Champagne corks popped than the Federal Court of Appeal ruled in the fall that Ottawa hadn't properly consulted with First Nations or examined the impact on marine life. The project is in limbo until those failings are addressed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“[The court ruling] means it has slowed down, but it is still alive and I think it is going to get done," Ms. Notley said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The line has come to symbolize not only Alberta's struggles to get resources to market but also frustration over a stubbornly slow rebound in the oil-based economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There have been pro-pipeline demonstrations in recent weeks along with renewed fringe commentary for Alberta to leave Confederation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Notley has taken to sniping at Quebec for criticizing Alberta's “dirty energy" and has joined critics who say Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's federal government has failed – offering sympathy but little else – to sustain one of the core drivers of the national economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Political analysts and recent opinion polls suggest Ms. Notley remains popular. But Jason Kenney and his United Conservatives will pick up the fight when the election is held, by law, sometime in March, April or May.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Kenney suggests Ms. Notley is the author of her own misfortune by bringing in a carbon tax and working with Mr. Trudeau, alleging that he is making it harder to get approval for energy megaprojects.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I can understand perhaps why they tried to make it [work with the Prime Minister] but it has been a complete failure," Mr. Kenney said in an interview. “Even the Premier now seems to acknowledge that through the change in her tone.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Too little, too late."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Kenney has a more combative approach and has promised to take the federal government to court over its carbon-tax plan. Polls and political observers say the dominant election issues will be the economy, jobs, and who can help put food on the table.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“If we had an election today, we'd have an overwhelming UCP majority," Calgary-based pollster Janet Brown said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Albertans are singularly focused on the economy and what's necessary to get the economy moving. At this moment in time, they think Jason Kenney and the UCP would be more competent at managing those things."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The NDP has already signalled its attack lines by warning that a Kenney government would gut departmental budgets and threaten hard-won gains for women and the LGBTQ community.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Brown said United Conservative numbers have remained strong since the party was formed in 2017 in a merger of the Wildrose and Progressive Conservative parties. So far, NDP attacks have not resonated.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“They keep trying to throw stuff at Jason Kenney, trying to paint him as anti-LGBTQ, a bigot, a racist all sorts of things.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">My polling numbers just don't suggest that any of that stuff is sticking. I'm just impressed not just where that UCP number is, but how unchanging it is."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Calgary political scientist Duane Bratt said Alberta may statistically be out of a recession, but that's not how people feel. “And when times are bad, you lash out at the incumbent government," he says. “That's a simple fact."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fighting hard to come up the middle is the Alberta Party under a new leader, former Edmonton mayor Stephen Mandel.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The party has long been a small-time player. It elected just one member in 2015, but added two more in floor-crossings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But it already has more than 50 candidates and expects to soon fill the full slate of 87.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Mandel said the Alberta Party is the perfect middleground choice, because it combines the United Conservatives' fiscal conservatism with the NDP's socially progressive outlook.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“People don't like the polarization of the province," he said. “They want to see more balance."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Until four years ago, constructing housing for workers in Alberta's oil patch had been a hefty part of Horizon North's business. Then, the price of oil crashed and so did the demand for thousands of quickly built apartments at remote locations in the province.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the ensuing couple of years, the company's executives thought they might have to start shutting down part of their operations in British Columbia - the firm's two main building plants are in Kamloops and Abbotsford.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And then, B.C. elected a new NDP government that, faced with a difficult affordable-housing shortage, was promising to pour millions into providing homeless people with apartments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“[So] instead of laying off 300 people in Kamloops, we decided to pivot," said Rod Graham, chief executive of the Calgary-based company that was formed in 2006.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After the NDP took office, temporary modular-housing blocks went up in parking lots, vacant development sites and parks in communities across B.C. – but particularly in Vancouver – to provide rapidly built housing for 2,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Horizon North provided almost half of that, including all 600 units in Vancouver.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The catalyst for us really was the Vancouver affordable-housing effort," Mr. Graham said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other modular-home factories that helped supply the first round of 2,000 homes include the Muchalat Group on Vancouver Island and Metric Modular in Penticton.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The initiative to build apartments quickly for the homeless is now the impetus for a broader move to provide affordable housing for a whole range of income earners priced out of the stratospheric costs of the traditional condo and single-family home market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The B.C. government is planning to use modular buildings, where construction costs can be as much as 25 per cent lower than for traditional construction, for all kinds of residents, from the working poor to middle-class renters.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I was blown away with what could be possible," said B.C. Housing Minister Selina Robinson, who has toured three different modular-home factories in the province in the past few months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“It absolutely has a potential for growth. It could be tailored to unique communities. I'm pretty excited about it."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The modular-housing option doesn't just help with costs. It also allows the province to give a boost to a new, B.C.-focused industry that uses local wood and can provide employment in communities outside the Lower Mainland that have been hit with job losses in the resource sector.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We have trees and we have an industry here," Ms. Robinson said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The province has already spent $290-million for the temporary modular homes, which have been set up, in a matter of months, in places as different as the parking lot next to Vancouver's downtown civic theatre, on a piece of industrial land in Kelowna and on vacant land next to an existing social-housing project in Victoria.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The B.C. government has promised another $1.9-billion for 4,900 permanent apartments in 42 communities – and some of those are likely to be the new modular ones.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Modular is an accepted building form for those [permanent units]," said Shayne Ramsay, the CEO of the government's BC Housing agency.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He said the savings don't just come from more efficient construction, which can reduce by a quarter the typical $200-asquare-foot minimum cost the agency now faces for the cheapest “stick-built" social housing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On top of the reduced construction costs, savings also come because finished units can be built and stored in advance and then quickly moved to a site, as soon as builders have their municipal permits. In conventional construction, they have to wait months or even years for the land to be available to start even the first step of a project.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Several groups that have received money from BC Housing to create social housing in their communities have chosen modular housing as their option, including in Kamloops, Smithers and Kelowna.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The City of Surrey had been planning a permanent modular social-housing project, which would have been a first for the Lower Mainland, but that's on hold for the moment because of a new council that is reversing some decisions of the previous one.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The main difference with the permanent modular homes and the temporary ones will be the inclusion of concrete foundations for the new apartment blocks. At least one project, in Kamloops, will even have elevators.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The modular homes built so far for homeless people have generated sporadic opposition in some communities, but more focused on the tenants, rather than any concerns that the buildings look cheap and out of place.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Kelowna, Councillor Luke Stack told local reporters that an early proposal looked like a “trailer park," because it was going to consist of an assembly of previously used construction trailers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But once the new-style modular homes were substituted, he said it looked no different from any other small office building in the area.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Modular housing is widely used in Europe, but has had less attraction in North America, where it's been stereotyped as trailer-park-style housing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But modular-home construction companies in Canada and the United States are starting to get a foothold, as everyone struggles with the soaring cost of construction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Horizon North has built a modular hotel in Oliver, while Metric has provided student housing for Trinity Western University in the Fraser Valley.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Companies also provide prefab single-family housing. But until now, the construction method hasn't been used much to create low-cost apartment buildings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For a government that has promised to foster the building of 114,000 affordable homes in a decade, the promise of modular construction to achieve that goal at a bargain has many people excited.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For Horizon North's Mr.Graham, it feels like his team is on the cusp of the ideal “made in B.C." solution.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The company is targeting $150million in sales this year for this part of its business because of the burst of interest - an expansion that prompted it to lure the head of Vancouver's affordable-housing agency, Luke Harrison. He has been made a Horizon North vicepresident with the job of growing its modular-housing portfolio.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For Mr. Graham, it has redefined his business.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“This is the future of our company."</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The most important number in Canadian politics in 2019 may not be Justin Trudeau's approval numbers or the horse race between the Liberals and the Conservatives.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The number everyone in Ottawa is captivated by? The one showing the steady decline in support for the New Democratic Party in 2018. A recent Ipsos Reid poll shows the party at 18 per cent support, down five percentage points since March.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Trudeau's approval numbers have also been plummeting in the last year, but Liberals say that's the cost of governing, especially when the financial markets are trembling and Alberta is in an uproar about a lack of access to markets for oil producers. Most political operatives, on all sides, point out that Canadians tend to give the benefit of the doubt to an incumbent with a majority.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But all three major parties are affected by the NDP's recent struggles under new leader Jagmeet Singh, who will be vying for a seat in an upcoming byelection in Burnaby, British Columbia.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Going into an election campaign with a weak NDP and a strong Liberal Party "has catastrophic implications for Andrew Scheer," said Ken Boessenkool, a former strategist for Stephen Harper. "Andrew faces a tough set of circumstances. Most of which are out of his control."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The last Conservative majority government, in 2011, benefited from a surge by Jack Layton's NDP that stripped seats away from the weakened Liberal Party. Now, the situation is reversed and Conservatives worry that an NDP collapse in the 2019 election is imminent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A major problem for the NDP is that it doesn't have an identity, said Andrew MacDougall, a former director of communications for Stephen Harper. At various times in its history, the party has been both a highlyprincipled leftist party that would forsake power to stay true to itself and, under Layton and former leader Thomas Mulcair, a pragmatic party that could open up a big tent and potentially win an election.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Trudeau has moved so far to the left that he's crowded them out of their own issues," said MacDougall, who believes these problems are compounded by Singh, who he described as "complete nullity" who "looks impotent."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Boessenkool said the top issue for the 2019 election campaign will be the carbon tax and said he expects it to resemble the 1988 election, which saw Liberal leader John Turner battle Brian Mulroney almost exclusively on a newly signed free trade agreement with the United States.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although irregular migration and immigration have been dominating the news recently, Boessenkool said it's unlikely the Conservatives will want to fight an election campaign on that issue, because the party is split on it. "The undertones of it divides the conservative movement," he said. Most parties prefer to fight elections on issues their base is in full agreement on and which divide the opposition party.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The federal-provincial relationship could be one of the continuing stories of 2019, said Shane MacKenzie, an associate at the public relations firm Ensight and former social media coordinator for the Liberal Party.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Unlike complaints during the Harper era of inaction and unresponsiveness, the current complaints under Trudeau are about overreach and turf," said MacKenzie. Most of that centres on the carbon tax, which several provinces are fighting in court "but nothing worth doing is ever easy," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MacDougall agreed that the spectacle of the angry premiers is something Canadians will notice.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"People who don't follow politics closely see a lot of disharmony in Canada," he said. Whether it's provincial squabbling, the carbon tax or the heated debate around irregular migration, it gives the impression that the government has lost control.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although Doug Ford's Progressive Conservative Party won a majority government in Ontario, there's not a lot of lessons or benefits that are transferable to the federal Conservatives, Boessenkool said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Liberal government had been in power for more than a decade and the electoral map doesn't quite line up for the Conservative Party the way it did for the Progressive Conservatives in Ontario.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The Etobicoke seats, for example, where Ford cleans up, those aren't very accessible to the federal party," said Boessenkool.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MacDougall said the federal party could learn from Ford's relentless and simple messaging on the environment, which described it as a pocketbook issue and involved dismantling Ontario's cap-and-trade program and fighting the federal carbon tax.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It'll be more comfortable for Scheer when he has his own plans on the climate," said MacDougall.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That could be an uphill battle for Scheer, with so much noise coming from the provinces about the government's climate change plans. The strong message from the Ford government could swamp the federal party's message, said MacKenzie.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Scheer ... hasn't released a climate plan, so Ford, Trump, and Harper's voices speak for him among voters," said MacKenzie, via email. "Silence speaks volumes when introducing yourself to voters."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And although polls have been in flux recently, Canadians continued to agree on one thing in 2018, at least: two-thirds of people think Question Period is just "politically charged theatre" that should be improved.</p>

As oil prices plunged, Canadian equities were hit hard and oversold. As sentiment on equities begins to shift, investors could once again see some of the TSX's "trapped value" being unlocked.

Regardless of the more cautious approach, De Verteuil sees the S&P/TSX index gaining more than 1,300 points.

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CALGARY—In yet another sign the city is still recovering from the oil recession, Calgary's food bank saw a surge in demand for its services this month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Historically, the last month of the year is always the busiest time for the <span class="companylink">Calgary Food Bank</span>. But this year, the food bank gave out nearly 200 more food hampers when compared to December 2017. Food bank spokesperson Shawna Ogston said that while it may not seem like a large increase, it still means hundreds more families needed food hampers this holiday season.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On top of that, Ogston said she's seen a general month-over-month increase in <span class="companylink">Calgary Food Bank</span> usage.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We're seeing it month to month increasing by a couple hundred more hampers,” Ogston said. “We're still doing close to 6,000 hampers per month, every month. And it's just steadily increasing year over year.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ogston said the demand shows citizens are still recovering from the economic downturn that hit Alberta several years ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We were sort of the canary in the coal mine,” Ogston said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We asked a few years back, 'What's happening? Why is there such a sudden influx in hamper demand?' And that's when we saw things starting to change in the economy. And it just hasn't recovered for our clients at all.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ogston added that it's not uncommon to see unemployed or underemployed clients, coming to the food bank for their first or second hamper, who need to access the service temporarily when their money isn't stretching far enough.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She added that she's seen examples where a client's truck breaks down, and to pay for the repairs, that client's only option is to use money they'd budgeted for food. December can be an especially bad time for this when the number of clients who need their services increases because of the strain from the holidays.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But while the food bank can sometimes see increased attention with more groups coming to volunteer during the holiday season, Ogston said it's important to remember the need for donations and public support continues even after December ends.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Hunger doesn't just happen during the holiday season,” Ogston said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We know, especially looking at our statistics and year-over-year demand, that this will continue into the new year, and families will still be struggling and looking for ways to cut their budgets back, and they may have to reach out to the food bank.”</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">* US refineries go down for maintenance- causes overload on rerouted pipelines – Canadian oil dives to $10/bbl.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">* Take away capacity create glut of Alberta oil –Trans mountain pipeline on hold due to court ruling on deficiencies on environmental impact and intervener status.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">* September freak snow storm creates spring breakup situations in the fall. Road bans introduced for half the month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">* All of the above played a role in pushing Q2’19 revenues down 8% from Q2’18. A substantial part of this decrease is the result of unprecedented 2-3-week road bans in September due to a freak snow storm. In Q2’19 the Company managed to get 5-10% rate increases from various key customers to compensate for increasing operating cost such as fuel – equipment etc. New rates are scheduled to roll in by the end of 2018.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">* Gross margin decreased to 29% from 36%. Factors contributing to this were higher fuel costs, and decrease in tank rental utilization for month of September due to road bans. Customers expressed urgency to gear up as quick as possible in October- this necessitated that the Company hire subcontractors to complete various jobs on schedule, this also contributed to pushing margins down.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">* EBITDAS dropped to $629K from $1.2M in Q2’18</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">* Income loss before tax was $(319) K compared to $82K last year. Due to the accumulated loss position – Company did not claim any tax credits for income taxes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">* The Company is still in the process of completing its annual review with our senior lender to rectify a covenant breach at year end. This process is taking longer than usual due to the senior lenders time and workflow constraints. The completion of the review and covenant amendments are expected to be completed before the end of Q3. Until the completion of the review and covenant amendment, all senior lender long term debt will be classified as current. OutlookOn December 13th, 2018, the <span class="companylink">International Energy Agency</span> (“IEA”) announced it’s forecasting an oil supply deficit in 2019. World demand is expected to grow at 1.4 million bbls/day and with the recently announced <span class="companylink">OPEC</span> production cuts of 1.2 million bbls/day, IEA is forecasting a supply deficit to occur by the second quarter of next year. Canada currently produces about 4.5 million bbls/day and over the course of the next year, is expected to increase production by an additional 220 thousand(K) bbls/day. In spite of this healthy production of fossil fuels, access to tide water and foreign markets is once again playing a heavy hand in discounting the price for our product. The price differential on getting Alberta oil to market, in October – November of this year, has pushed Western Canadian Select pricing down to$10/bbl, making it the cheapest oil in the world.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The recently announced Alberta government initiatives for a production reduction of about 9% will take about 300K bbls per day off the market starting in January of 2019. This should help alleviate some of the 35 million bbls of backlogged inventory which is one of the key factors contributing to the steep differential on Alberta oil. The above stated reduction is roughly equal to the difference between what we are producing and what we can squeeze into pipelines and rail cars.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Additional take away capacity relief, in the form of rail cars, will come on stream over the course of the year and should help clear about 300-400K bbls of oil per day, by the end of 2019. Also, the Enbridge line 3 pipeline upgrade is expected to be finished by third quarter of 2019 and should provide an additional 400K bbls/day of take away capacity. In addition, the overflow in existing US pipelines is expected to bleed off over the course of 2019 when additional US pipeline capacity from the Permian comes on stream.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With the relaxing of capacity constraints, the differential on oil pricing is expected to narrow and this is good news for those planning more capital expenditures in our industry. Given that 2018 was not exactly a banner year for industry capital expenditures and activity levels – 2019 is beginning to show signs of more promise. Dalmac’s customer base, which largely consists of all the majors in the oil industry, are preparing for a very intensive drilling and completion season starting in January of 2019. Much of this activity is taking place in one of the most prolific and liquids rich production formations in Canada – namely the Duvernay of west central Alberta, which lies in Dalmac’s “back yard”.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dalmac is relying on its customers’ commitments for various drilling, maintenance and plant certification projects which are scheduled to run over the course of next year to help bolster our activity and utilization levels. With the recent developments, described above, and the expectation that more take away capacity is soon coming on stream, we are confident that further development and activity in our industry will continue follow suit.</p>

Questionable campaign tactics that took place while Mr. Brown led the Progressive Conservatives continue to haunt Premier Doug Ford’s party. Privately, top party strategists raised concerns that multiple candidates during the campaign, including some who now sit as MPPs, had links to Snover Dhillon, a political operative who has previously been convicted of fraud. According to an investigation [https://www.theglobeandmail.com/canada/article-questionable-campaign-tactics-under-brown-haunt-fords-pc-government/] by The Globe’s Karen Howlett and Jill Mahoney, Mr. Ford’s transition team considered ties to Mr. Dhillon during private deliberations over cabinet appointments. The Globe interviewed nearly two dozen party insiders and reviewed e-mails and banking records. According to internal e-mails, Mr. Brown’s advisers had developed a strategy to address allegations of fake memberships, ineligible voters and ballot-box stuffing in two nomination races but did not put it into action. The Progressive Conservatives later overturned nomination results in six races after Mr. Brown’s resignation amid allegations of sexual misconduct. There are two active police investigations underway – one by Hamilton Police into allegations of fraud and forgery and the other by York Regional Police’s major fraud unit into a data breach. Although nomination races are how parties across the country determine their candidates for elections, there is no oversight conducted by federal or provincial watchdogs.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Setting a new bar for opaque corporate communications, <span class="companylink">Lululemon Athletica</span> bade a sudden goodbye to CEO Laurent Potdevin in early February, a departure enhanced by a cash payment of $3.35 million (U.S.) and an additional $1.65 million to be paid in instalments. Was this a case of #MeToo? Who knew? Shareholder David Shabbouei filed suit against the company and its directors in late November in Delaware's Chancery Court, alleging a toxic "boys' club" culture that resulted in bullying, gender discrimination and sexual favouritism. Shabbouei's "waste of corporate assets" lawsuit, which additionally seeks corporate governance reform, could be an interesting test case for corporations eager to richly disappear a CEO at the expense of shareholders. <span class="companylink">Lululemon</span> declined to comment.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Comedian Jim Carrey's tweet in early February presaged the 13-person indictment by special counsel Robert Mueller over meddling in the U.S. election. Unravelling the Russian Internet Research Agency's "information warfare against the United States of America" included "thematic" group pages on <span class="companylink">Facebook</span> (religion, immigration) that drew hundreds of thousands of followers and the purchase of advertisements on <span class="companylink">Facebook</span> promoting "Down with Hillary" rallies.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Not a month goes by without some fresh drama at <span class="companylink">Facebook</span>, this one being the culmination of a yearlong investigation by the Observer into Cambridge Analytica and its work on both Brexit and the Trump campaign. The mid-March revelations by whistleblower Christopher Wylie explosively detailed how the personal information of more than 50 million <span class="companylink">Facebook</span> users had been taken without their knowledge, throwing a grenade into prior <span class="companylink">Facebook</span> testimony before a U.K. parliamentary inquiry in which the company insisted that user data had not been compromised. The opposite was true. After the story broke, as hours of Zuckerberg silence passed into days, #whereszuck started trending. After four days, the CEO at last issued a tone-deaf promise to create tools allowing users to revoke data permissions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I don't want to grow up, because if I did, I couldn't be a <span class="companylink">Toys 'R' Us</span> kid."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Just six months after <span class="companylink">Toys "R" Us</span> unveiled its strategic plan for reinvention, including interactive spaces and live product demonstrations, the New Jersey-based toy giant announced it would be winding down its U.S. operations, including 735 stores. While the demise of Geoffrey the giraffe's empire was blamed in part on the so-called "retail apocalypse" that had already claimed <span class="companylink">Sears</span> and others, the more than $5 billion (U.S.) in debt the toy chain had assumed as the result of a leveraged buyout in 2005 was too great a burden to bear. One hopeful note: The Wayne, N.J.-based company would pursue a going concern sale for international operations, including Canada. And another: In April, <span class="companylink">Fairfax Financial Holdings Ltd</span>. would make a successful $300-million bid for <span class="companylink">Toys "R" Us Canada</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">APRIL</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Well I was going to terminate <span class="companylink">NAFTA</span> as of two or three days from now."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The ever-mercurial U.S. president continued to lob thought bombs into the seemingly never-ending negotiations on the three-way trade deal, with deadlines set possibly for the Summit of the Americas in mid-April or perhaps the end of April or maybe by the time of the Mexican election in July or how about before the U.S. mid-terms in November. Or whenever. At the end of April, Trump offered that, come to think of it, he liked the president of Mexico and the Canadian prime minister "very much" and so would withdraw his threatened termination. "Let's make this a fair deal," he said, sounding like a contemporary Monty Hall.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"So this is an arm's race, right? I mean, they're going to keep on getting better at this, and we need to invest in keeping on getting better at this, too."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Appearing before the <span class="companylink">U.S. Senate</span>'s commerce and judiciary committees, Mark Zuckerberg addressed the challenge of blocking foreign actors from interfering in U.S. elections. "There are people in Russia whose job it is to try to exploit our systems," Zuckerberg said, promising better AI tools for identifying fake accounts. Earlier that month, Facebook chief technology officer Mark Schroepfer revealed that the number of <span class="companylink">Facebook</span> users whose information had been accessed without their knowledge in the Cambridge Analytica scandal was off by, oh, 40 million or so. In a conference call with journalists the following day, Zuckerberg owned up to a failure to focus on preventing abuse: "That goes for fake news, foreign interference in elections, hate speech, in addition to developers and data privacy. We didn't take a broad enough view of what our responsibility is, and that was a huge mistake. It was my mistake." Did he still think he was the best person to run <span class="companylink">Facebook</span>? Answer: "Yes."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The Province does not have a role with the Hydro One board in the processes of appointment, removal, replacement, and compensation relating to executive officers or over related succession planning."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Appearing before the <span class="companylink">Washington Utilities and Transportation Commission</span>, Hydro One CEO Mayo Schmidt attempted to assuage the regulator's concerns about potential political interference from Hydro One's largest shareholder. In its proposed $5.3-billion (U.S.) takeover of Seattle-based utility <span class="companylink">Avista Corp</span>., Hydro One under Schmidt was making its first big play in growing its distribution and transmission assets. Asked whether concerns raised about Hydro One's potential vulnerability to political change were valid, Schmidt offered a confident answer: "No."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"You can take this to the bank. The CEO is gone and the board is gone."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Guess who.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MAY</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"If privacy is a human right ... then we contend that <span class="companylink">Facebook</span>'s poor stewardship of customer data is tantamount to a human rights violation."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Having faced the wrath of political leaders on both sides of the Atlantic, <span class="companylink">Facebook</span> faced shareholders at the end of May at its annual meeting. Christine Jantz, chief investment officer of NorthStar Asset Management, did not mince words. Decrying the social media company's failure to protect privacy, she attacked the Zuckerberg-controlled corporate structure, labelling it "an egregious example of when a board is formed by a CEO to meet his needs." Outside the meeting, the newly formed Freedom From <span class="companylink">Facebook</span> coalition, which seeks to have <span class="companylink">Facebook</span> broken up, floated a banner across the sky reading "You Broke Democracy." The entire <span class="companylink">Facebook</span> board was re-elected. Zuckerberg remains chairman and CEO. No governance changes were made.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Is a company a sandbox for the CEO, or is the CEO an employee? If he's an employee, he needs a boss, and that boss is the board. The chairman runs the board. How can the CEO be his own boss?"</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Not for the first time, Andrew Grove's advocacy for the separation of the CEO's role from that of chairman made its way into a shareholder resolution, this one promoted by the advocacy group <span class="companylink">SumOfUs</span> on behalf of the B.C. Government and Service Employees' Union General Fund. The target: Loblaw Cos., where Galen Weston the Younger commands both duties. In its supporting statement, <span class="companylink">SumOfUs</span> cited the bread price-fixing scheme as reason for more robust oversight. The resolution was soundly defeated, in favour, said the chairman/CEO, of the "continuity of family leadership."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I can assure you we would not have done this deal unless we thought there were hellacious opportunities for the upside over the next several years."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That was Texas oilman Richard Kinder trumpeting his 2005 acquisition of <span class="companylink">Terasen Inc</span>., or as we know it today, the Trans Mountain pipeline. <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span> promised "hundreds" of new jobs in British Columbia and Alberta tied to infrastructure expansion. Fast forward a dozen years to see Finance Minister Bill Morneau, flanked by then-natural resources minister Jim Carr, breaking the news that an agreement had been reached to purchase the pipeline and the expansion infrastructure from <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span>. For $4.5 billion, the citizens of Canada suddenly owned a pipeline.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">President Donald Trump tweeted with speed in response to Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's promise of retaliatory tariffs against those imposed by the U.S. on Canadian steel and aluminum. The unprecedented post-G7 spat marshaled Trump reinforcements, including economic adviser Larry Kudlow. "He really kind of stabbed us in the back," Kudlow told <span class="companylink">CNN</span>, only to be, well, trumped by trade adviser Peter Navarro. "There's a special place in hell for any foreign leader that engages in bad faith diplomacy with President Donald J. Trump and then tries to stab him in the back on the way out the door," Navarro told Fox News.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Small, light, and hard to avoid, it's no wonder plastic straws dumped into the sea get stuck in sea turtles' nostrils, lodged in the stomachs of baby seabirds, and end up in our food chain after being eaten by fish."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The aforementioned activist group <span class="companylink">SumOfUs</span> demonstrated the power of the people when close to half a million consumers responded to their petition calling for <span class="companylink">McDonald's</span> in the U.K. and Ireland to end the use of plastic straws. After a two-month paper straw trial, the fast-food chain announced in June that it would commit fully to the paper alternative in its 1,361 restaurants in those markets, with the rollout starting in September and completion targeted for 2019.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We had a choice. We decided that our goal was transparency. We're just erring on the side of being more transparent."</p>

Doug Ford was just days into his new job as premier when he ushered "Six-Million-Dollar Man" Mayo Schmidt out the door at Hydro One along with the entire slate of directors. What timing. The <span class="companylink">Washington Utilities and Transportation Commission</span> was just days from releasing its decision on Hydro One's takeover of Seattle-based <span class="companylink">Avista Corp</span>. "It is unclear how these developments may bear on our ongoing consideration of the proposed transaction," the commission announced, delaying its decision until Dec. 14 and opening the door to a new round of testimony.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I find that deeply offensive.

I don't think that they're intentionally getting it wrong, but I think ..."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It was a cumbersome answer, and one that he has since amended, but in an interview with Kara Swisher in Recode, Mark Zuckerberg had a hard time explaining when abhorrent content should be pulled from <span class="companylink">Facebook</span>. "There was a set of people who denied the Holocaust happened," Zuckerberg said, before adding what sounded like a defence of giving Holocaust deniers the freedom of public comment on his platform.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"An important issue we face is how the economy reacts to higher interest rates given the high debt loads being carried by Canadian households."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In announcing a 25-basis-point increase in its benchmark rate to 1.5 per cent, Bank of Canada governor Stephen Poloz maintained his trademark poker faced demeanour. The Canadian economy, having been fuelled by housing and consumption, looked to be headed toward serial rate hikes, a view endorsed by those who listened very carefully to Poloz's observation that five-year mortgage holders due for renewal in 2019 and 2020 would experience only a very modest increase in debt service.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">AUGUST</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Hi @Facebook, you removed our post promoting the need for Holocaust Education for apparently violating community standards. You haven't given us a reason, yet allow Holocaust Denial pages to still exist. Seems a little hypocritical?"</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I mean, it's legal, right?"</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Right, but ... Tesla founder Elon Musk stayed true to his idiosyncratic nature when he smoked up on comedian Joe Rogan's show, appearing very "meh" about the whole experience. Was this appropriate public comportment for a CEO? Days later, Musk would agree to a $20-million (U.S.) fine from the <span class="companylink">Securities and Exchange Commission</span> for inaccurately tweeting that he had lined up financing to take Tesla private. As part of the settlement, he would step aside as chairman of the company. Lesson learned? Thankfully, no. Days after the SEC deal, Musk renamed the SEC the Shortseller Enrichment Commission.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yanghee Lee, the <span class="companylink">UN</span>'s special rapporteur on Myanmar, was concise in her assessment of the role played by <span class="companylink">Facebook</span> in the genocide of the Rohingya.

After explaining the dilemma of the misplaced passport to the Star, Chong did, eventually, make it, if a couple days late - but chill, right? Economists, meanwhile, crunched the numbers on the potential impact of legalization. <span class="companylink">The Toronto-Dominion Bank</span> estimated a potential boost to Canada's GDP of between $7 billion and $8 billion. But given the degree to which cannabis activity already existed, unreported, in the economy, the bank cautioned this was a bit of illusion.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New York City Comptroller Scott Stringer, custodian of the New York City Pension Funds, pulled no punches in announcing a shareholder proposal co-filed with four other fund managers calling on <span class="companylink">Facebook</span> to make the board chair an independent position. Stringer's language was stark: "An independent board chair is essential to moving <span class="companylink">Facebook</span> forward from this mess, and to re-establish trust with Americans and investors alike."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Don't you agree that it shows that there's a risk of political intervention by the province in Hydro One's corporate affairs?"</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ann Rendahl of the <span class="companylink">Washington Utilities and Transportation Commission</span> expressed the obvious back-to-square-one concerns about the Hydro One/Avista transaction. How could Washington ratepayers be reassured that there won't be any more surprises? And how to calm the jitters of those consumers who remain unconvinced that the takeover is in their long-term interest? As Rendahl phrased it, "How can we un-ring a bell?"</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NOVEMBER</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"They are not closing our damned plant without one helluva fight."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An enraged Unifor president Jerry Dias shot back at <span class="companylink">General Motors</span> after the Detroit-based carmaker laid out its plan to accelerate its "transformation for the future." The Oshawa assembly plant would be "unallocated" in 2019, meaning that no product would be allocated for production beyond December 2019, putting 2,500 people out of work. GM's car-making history in Oshawa, Dias vowed, would not end there.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The USMCA will be fantastic for all!"</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The what? Naturally, President Donald Trump emphasized the primacy of the U.S. in signing the "new" trilateral trade deal with Canada and Mexico. The down-to-the-wire agreement, signed on Enrique Pena Nieto's last day in office as president of Mexico, leaves much to be resolved. Trump's tariffs on steel and aluminum for starters. And oh, politics. Nancy Pelosi, the front-runner to be elected speaker of the House of Representatives when the Democrats formally take control in January, prefigured the fight ahead. "The trade agreement formerly known as Prince - no, I mean, formerly known ... as <span class="companylink">NAFTA</span> is a work in progress," she said.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a scathing smackdown of the proposed takeover of <span class="companylink">Avista Corp</span>. by Hydro One, the <span class="companylink">Washington Utilities and Transportation Commission</span> found that the "marginal" benefits of the deal were outweighed by political risk, concluding there was nothing to prevent governmental interference in the future. Hydro One and <span class="companylink">Avista</span> have petitioned the commission to reconsider its decision, arguing, in part, that the commission "misapprehended" the political risks and failed to properly evaluate the benefits of the transaction for <span class="companylink">Avista</span> customers.</p>

As Ime Archibong explained it in a post: "In order for you to write a message to a <span class="companylink">Facebook</span> friend from within Spotify, for instance, we needed to give Spotify 'write access.' For you to be able to read messages back, we needed Spotify to have 'read access.'" But that didn't translate into users having their private messages read, Archibong insisted and, hey, that was years ago. This latest peek into possible privacy violations held the news cycle for a day, until Washington D.C.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Line 5, operated by the Canadian multinational company Enbridge, has been enveloped in controversy for months.

"The value of this pipeline almost exclusively goes to Enbridge Energy," said Mike Shriberg, who heads the <span class="companylink">National Wildlife Federation</span>'s regional centre for the Great Lakes and sits on the Michigan Pipeline Safety Advisory Board. "Yet it's risking arguably our most valuable asset."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The stakes could hardly be higher. The larger Great Lakes system supplies drinking water for 40 million people, sustains thousands of plant and animal species and supports vital industries, such as fishing, logging and tourism. (The Straits of Mackinac, where an expanse of freshwater ripples below one of the world's great suspension bridges, offers one of Michigan's most famous images.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While most state residents feel a special attachment to the Great Lakes, the connection runs particularly deep for Indigenous people. Several islands near the Straits are home to ancestral burial grounds and, under the 1836 treaty that led to Michigan's statehood, the Anishinaabek people ceded 14 million acres to the <span class="companylink">U.S. government</span> but retained hunting and fishing rights. The pipeline, Indigenous groups argue, threatens not just the environment but culture.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"What they're doing is taking away our connection with Mother Earth," said Cody Bigjohn, of the Odawa tribe, who wears camouflage hunting pants and seems to exude the outdoors. "We use all the things we gather ... So if that gets all poisoned, then we got to go back to the government and ask them, 'Can we have some food?'"</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A spill at the Straits, perhaps the only place in the world where an oil pipeline travels through several miles of fresh water, could be unprecedented. Computer models predict a major rupture would release tens of thousands of barrels of oil, potentially contaminating more than 1,000 square miles of water and hundreds of miles of shoreline. The area has strong and frequently shifting currents. In winter, the lakes often freeze, which would dramatically complicate any cleanup effort.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Every spill is devastating," said Guy Meadows, director of the Great Lakes Research Center at Michigan Technological University, who led a state-commissioned risk analysis released in September. "There is no single worst-case scenario."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Michigan remains scarred from one Enbridge disaster. In 2010, a different pipeline burst in the southern part of the state, ultimately releasing more than a million gallons of tarlike diluted bitumen into the Kalamazoo River watershed - one of the largest inland oil spills in U.S. history. More than two dozen spills have also occurred since Line 5 opened.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More recent revelations about its condition through the Straits, from the disintegration of protective coating to insufficient anchor supports, have inflamed the years-long debate. In April, a tugboat's anchor collided with the pipe, denting it in three places. State officials have repeatedly faulted Enbridge for failing to communicate about problems.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I am no longer satisfied with the operational activities and public information tactics that have become status quo for Enbridge," Gov. Rick Snyder said in a November 2017 statement after the company (which months earlier had denied a report that cited coating gaps) disclosed the discovery many more.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">Enbridge</span> maintains that the latest structural issues have been remedied and that tests have proven the pipeline safe. According to spokesperson Ryan Duffy, the company is committed to working with the state and allaying public concern.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Dan McTeague, a senior petroleum analyst at GasBuddy.com, says gasoline prices are at near-18-month lows because of global oil prices that have tumbled over the past two months on worries of an economic downturn, a U.S.-China trade tiff and concerns <span class="companylink">OPEC</span> oil cartel members won't live up to production cuts.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">McTeague says prices in B.C. are up two to six cents per litre compared with the same time last year, but would be lower if not for the effect of interruptions in fuel imports from Washington because of the outage of that state's Olympic pipeline in mid-December.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The U.S. benchmark West Texas Intermediate oil prices plunged to $42.53 (U.S.) on Christmas Eve, down 44 per cent from $76.41 per barrel on Oct. 3. They rallied to $46.22 on Wednesday but trended lower Thursday.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Alberta’s intervention in the oil market accomplished its mission by boosting heavy oil prices, but in the longer term the move may do more harm than good, one of the industry’s best-known forecasters said as he stepped down from his longtime post.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In early December, Alberta Premier Rachel Notley mandated an 8.7-per-cent reduction in oil production – some 325,000 barrels a day – to narrow a gaping discount on heavy crude against U.S. benchmark light oil that forced big losses in operations. It takes effect in January.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But major producers had already begun to respond by cutting back output on their own, said Martin King, who left in December as oil and gas price analyst at GMP FirstEnergy after more than two decades in the chair.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I was personally not in favour of government intervention on this. The market was already sending clear signals that we didn’t need all this production,” Mr. King said in a recent interview.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Before the government imposed cuts, energy companies had said they were on track to reduce production by as much as 160,000 barrels a day, with the price discount driving the decisions. Tight pipeline space was a factor in the glut, but so were short-term problems such as extensive maintenance at U.S. refineries, which slashed demand for Alberta crude.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The provincial government’s intervention provides more temptation to more meddle in the market and does not solve fundamental problems, such as the lack of pipeline capacity, Mr. King said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“That is always the wrong thing to do, especially in an industry that is as unpredictable and fast as the oil industry, and I don’t just mean in Canada but globally,” he said. “Things can change very quickly. We’ve seen that with the U.S. over the last few years with shale oil – it’s now an exporter and certainly on a large scale.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The spread between Western Canada Select heavy oil and U.S. benchmark West Texas intermediate had widened past US$40 a barrel in October and by November it pulled the price of the Canadian oil down below US$14. The price improved by as much as 50 per cent on the first day of trading after Ms. Notley’s announcement, and WCS has since climbed to more than US$30 a barrel as the discount narrowed to less than US$15.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The price differential will remain narrower in the coming months, Mr. King said. The wide price spread made it worthwhile to move as much crude by rail as possible and that business was starting to pick up, he said. A potential unintended consequence of the production cut is that the price spread falls below the cost of moving the crude to U.S. markets by rail, causing supplies to back up into Alberta again.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The supply cut had the backing of some producers, including <span class="companylink">MEG Energy Corp</span>. and <span class="companylink">Cenovus Energy Inc</span>., but integrated energy companies including <span class="companylink">Husky Energy Inc</span>. and <span class="companylink">Suncor Energy Inc</span>., whose refining operations benefited from low oil prices, urged the province to stay out of the market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The government has also made other moves to deal the seemingly endless delays in building new pipeline capacity to the West Coast. Prior to the production cut, Ms. Notley announced plans to buy 7,000 railway tank cars to help the industry shuttle Alberta crude to refineries and ports around the continent. Mr. King sees this as a risky investment that should be borne by the railways as opposed to the government. The cars will likely not get delivered until the end of 2019.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“If they are going to move this stuff by rail, most of it will end up being sent to the south, to the Gulf Coast, and probably end up being exported anyway. And the market would have just done that for you, in terms of the surplus,” he said, referring to the increased demand from refiners due to the low cost of the crude. “And potentially, two or three years from now, those rail cars might not even be needed, so the government’s going to be stuck with this rusting asset.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. King, 52, is a self-described “data and research geek” and a fixture in the energy industry since joining <span class="companylink">FirstEnergy</span> in 1997. His breakfast events at the Calgary Petroleum Club, where he has delivered oil and gas price forecasts with dry one-liners, regularly attracted audiences in the hundreds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When Mr. King joined the brokerage, the industry’s small and mid-size companies were at the start of a major boom in investment and activity. That sector has been hit the hardest since the downturn began in 2014, but its ingenuity will help pull it out of the current crisis, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I’m optimistic in the power of markets and smart people. I just hope the government doesn’t get in the way too much,” he said.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Canadian oil companies operating in Western Canada are producing 202,000 more barrels of crude per day than there is total pipeline capacity, according to a new study from the <span class="companylink">National Energy Board</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The report, commissioned by the federal government, puts an official figure on the amount of oil oversupply coming from the Western Canadian Sedimentary Basin, which spreads from British Columbia to Saskatchewan. The amount of oversupply was measured in September, the most recent month for which data was available.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Because total pipeline capacity is not always available to producers owing to maintenance work, the <span class="companylink">NEB</span> also studied production relative to normal pipeline movement. Using this metric, the oversupply amounts to 365,000 barrels a day (b/d).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Western Canada’s pipeline capacity has come into focus in recent months as the price of Canadian heavy crude, known as Western Canadian Select, saw its discount relative to benchmark North American oil plunge to US$50 a barrel in October, hurting oil producers as well as the Alberta government, which relies on royalties to help fund its spending.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The drop follows large investments by Canadian oil producers to bring new oil sands projects on stream, leading to a surge in supply. Over the first nine months of 2018, Western Canadian crude oil production grew by more than 2.7 per cent to 4.3 million b/d, according to the <span class="companylink">NEB</span>, up from 2.3 million b/d in 2005.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">However, the increase has not been matched with extra pipeline capacity since 2016. Pipelines move the vast majority of crude out of Western Canada, and adding new capacity has proved difficult with <span class="companylink">TransCanada</span>’s Keystone XL project facing opposition in parts of the United States and the expansion of the TransMountain pipeline running into numerous roadblocks – most recently, a decision from the Federal Court of Appeal that halted its construction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With oversupply building in Alberta, the provincial government has taken action. In November, Alberta announced negotiations to purchase rail cars that could transport 120,000 barrels of crude oil a day, and in early December the provincial government also announced production cuts to reduce the amount of crude produced by 325,000 b/d.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The price of Western Canadian Select has rebounded sharply since the production cuts were announced, climbing from a US$50 discount to US$16.50 as of Thursday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Alberta’s production cuts are expected to be temporary. Although approvals for additional pipeline capacity could take some time, U.S. refineries that process a lot of Western Canadian crude are scheduled to finish their current maintenance programs, which should draw from current inventories.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Five of the top 10 U.S. refiners of Canadian crude had planned maintenance over six months starting October. They included <span class="companylink">BP PLC</span>’s plant in Whiting, Ind., <span class="companylink">Exxon Mobil Corp</span>.’s facility in Joliet, Ill., and <span class="companylink">Marathon Petroleum Corp</span>.’s refinery in Detroit, and the outage was thought to total 400,000 b/d, according to Samir Kayande, director with RS Energy Group of Houston.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Long term, however, new pipelines will be crucial for Western Canadian crude. According to the <span class="companylink">NEB</span>, the Western Canadian Sedimentary Basin is expected to see its production grow to six million b/d by 2030, and 6.7 million b/d by 2040.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although the discount for Canadian crude has tightened dramatically in December, global oil prices have turned volatile. On Thursday, the price of West Texas Intermediate, the North American benchmark, fell 3.5 per cent to US$44.61. As recently as October, WTI was worth US$75 a barrel.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I know that the opposition wants to sort of revel in what they insist on hoping is defeat, but we've made more progress on getting a pipeline to tidewater than any other government has in the last 70 years," Notley told The Canadian Press in a year-end interview.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Notley will take voters to the polls in the spring after a 2018 that saw her tightly wrapped in the Gordian knot of the Trans Mountain pipeline expansion. It received a green light two years ago and would triple the amount of oil moving to the B.C. coast and from there overseas where it could fetch a better price.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Notley, while fighting court challenges and the B.C. government over the project, pulled it back from the abyss after the pipeline's owner started questioning whether it would ever get built. She got the federal government to buy it for $4.5 billion</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">No sooner had the champagne corks popped than the Federal Court of Appeal ruled in the fall that Ottawa hadn't properly consulted with First Nation or examined the impact on marine life.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The project is in limbo until those failings are addressed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"(The court ruling) means it has slowed down, but it is still alive and I think it is going to get done," said Notley.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The line has come to symbolize not only Alberta's struggles to get resources to market but also frustration over a stubbornly slow rebound in the oil-based economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There have been pro-pipeline demonstrations in recent weeks along with renewed fringe commentary for Alberta to leave Confederation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Notley has taken to sniping at Quebec for criticizing Alberta's "dirty energy" and has joined critics who say Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's federal government has failed — offering sympathy but little else — to sustain one of the core drivers of the national economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Political analysts and recent opinion polls suggest Notley remains popular. But Jason Kenney and his United Conservatives will pick up the fight when the election is held, by law, sometime in March, April or May.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Kenney suggests Notley is the author of her own misfortune by bringing in a carbon tax and working with Trudeau, who is making it harder to get approval for energy megaprojects.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I can understand perhaps why they tried to make it (work with Trudeau) but it has been a complete failure," said Kenney in an interview. "Even the premier now seems to acknowledge that through the change in her tone. Too little, too late."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Kenney has a more combative approach and has promised to take the federal government to court over its carbon tax plan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Polls and political observers say the dominant election issues will be the economy, jobs, and who can help put food on the table.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"If we had an election today, we'd have an overwhelming UCP majority," said Calgary-based pollster Janet Brown.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Albertans are singularly focused on the economy and what's necessary to get the economy moving. At this moment in time, they think Jason Kenney and the UCP would be more competent at managing those things."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The NDP has already signalled its attack lines by warning that a Kenney government would gut departmental budgets and threaten hard-won gains for women and the LGBTQ community.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Brown said United Conservative numbers have remained strong since the party was formed in 2017 in a merger of the Wildrose and Progressive Conservative parties. So far, NDP attacks have not resonated.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"They keep trying to throw stuff at Jason Kenney, trying to paint him as anti-LGBTQ, a bigot, a racist all sorts of things. My polling numbers just don't suggest that any of that stuff is sticking. I'm just impressed not just where that UCP number is, but how unchanging it is.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Calgary political scientist Duane Bratt said Alberta may statistically be out of a recession but that's not how people feel.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"And when times are bad, you lash out at the incumbent government. That's a simple fact."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fighting hard to come up the middle is the Alberta Party under new leader and former Edmonton mayor Stephen Mandel.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The party has long been a small-time player. It elected just one member in 2015 but added two more in floor-crossings. But it already has more than 50 candidates and expects to soon fill the full slate of 87.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mandel said the Alberta Party is the perfect middle-ground choice, because it combines the United Conservatives' fiscal conservatism with the NDP's socially progressive outlook.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"People don't like the polarization of the province," he said. "They want to see more balance."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If a vote were held as early as the first week of March, a writ could be dropped as early as February. Political scientist Chaldeans Mensah said that's when voters will really get engaged and fortunes could change quickly.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Right now the UCP is looking good, but I think it's too early to conclude that the election is over," said Mensah of MacEwan University in Edmonton.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The campaign and its dynamics will really tell the tale."</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Canadian economy entered 2018 on an unexpectedly impressive run. The country begins 2019 on a healthy note, but signs of weakness have raised a key question: How long until the good times come to an end?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Through much of 2018, Canada's unemployment rate hovered near a 40-year low and job-creation remained strong as the evidence pointed to an economy going at close to full tilt.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The hand-off was a good one, too – the country had posted three-per-cent growth for all of 2017, largely thanks to strong household spending. We'll have to wait a little for the final numbers, but forecasters say 2018 has likely delivered stillsturdy growth of about 2 per cent. But as 2019 approaches, there are worries the solid economic expansion is starting to show its age.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last month, the federal government's fall economic statement projected 2-per-cent growth again for 2019, but many predict the number will likely come in lower following a recent drop in oil prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In addition to the pullback in crude prices, experts point to jitters in the financial markets, predictions the U.S. economy – a key contributor to Canadian growth – will start to cool off and the United Kingdom's difficult divorce from the <span class="companylink">European Union</span>, which could ripple across the global economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On trade, Canada made it through a year filled with significant uncertainty, including the difficult negotiation and signing of an update to the North American free-trade Agreement.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many of the trade unknowns, however, will carry over into the new year. The road to <span class="companylink">NAFTA</span> 2.0's ratification could bring more drama, punishing American steel and aluminum tariffs remain in place and the clash of superpowers between Canada's two biggest trading partners continues to play out.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“There are always reflections around the cyclical downturns that happen and, as I've said, the impacts of a trade war between China and the United States could have significant impacts on the global economy – negative impacts on the global economy," Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said in a recent interview with The Canadian Press.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We have to make sure that we are prepared for rough waters if we encounter them."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Canada, potential trouble spots include the combination of high household debt, rising interest rates and slowing wage growth that's been “terrible" for about half a year following a good pickup early in 2018, says Matt Stewart, director of economics for The Conference Board of Canada.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Higher interest rates, Mr. Stewart added, have delivered a hit to household spending, which has been the primary driver of Canada's good economic fortunes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With overburdened consumers expected to take a breather, business investment is seen as the next critical source of growth. But Mr. Stewart said the transition has yet to materialize because investment has underperformed, likely owing to competitiveness concerns. Businesses aren't sure whether Canada's the best place to put their money.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In an effort to boost investment, Ottawa announced billions of dollars worth of corporate tax incentives in its fall statement. Taxpayers will have to wait and see if the federal changes will be enough to encourage more companies to invest in Canada.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Craig Alexander, chief economist of Deloitte, said the economy will continue to have healthy growth in 2019, but notes it's due for some moderation. The economy's evolution will have different impacts depending where one lives, he added.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For example, the energy sector faces big challenges.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Part of it comes from the recent plunge in oil prices, but there's also been an extra discount on the price of western Canadian crude caused by transportation bottlenecks out of the Alberta oilpatch. Ottawa offered assistance this month in the form of a $1.6-billion aid package to support oil and gas companies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Alberta, however, wants federal help to move its oil to new markets.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As statements from politicians go, the one released by Conservative Party Leader Andrew Scheer in midDecember about Alberta's oil woes was a doozy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Justin Trudeau has wanted to phase out Canada's energy industry since day one," Mr. Scheer said on Dec. 18, as Albertans demonstrated in support of the construction of a muchneeded new crude-oil pipeline. “In his Canada, there is no oil and gas sector. He is ashamed of it and wants it gone."</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Real anger and worry have overtaken Alberta this year, as the oil industry has been plunged into a crisis that is largely the product of a decade's worth of failed pipeline policy from Ottawa. But Mr. Scheer's over-the-top conspiracy theorizing is unhelpful, not to mention inaccurate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He is not alone in the overheated rhetoric department, though. A day later, Jack Mintz, the respected economist and fellow at the University of Calgary School of Public Policy, raised the spectre of Alberta separation in a piece in the Financial Post.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Mintz wrote that arguments in favour of “Albexit," as he coined it, are more justified than the United Kingdom's case was for leaving the <span class="companylink">European Union</span>. His words added fresh fuel on the resurgent flames of Western alienation ignited by the province's continuing slump.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Let's all take a deep breath. By the low standards of the Brexit fiasco, literally every jurisdiction in the world has reason to separate from whatever larger body it happens to feel aggrieved by. Albertans benefit enormously from being part of Canada. The province only really has one complaint about Confederation: It takes too damn long to build a pipeline.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's a legitimate beef. But it's not exactly the stuff of liberation movements. And it doesn't necessarily have to remain so in the years to come. Plus, it's very hard to see how the complications of cross-jurisdictional energy transportation would be lessened by turning provincial borders into international ones.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But it is easy to see why Albertans are so frustrated by the slow pace at which their biggest hope for relief, the expansion of the Trans Mountain pipeline that carries oil from Edmonton to Vancouver, has been progressing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That frustration turned to anger this year as a global glut of crude oil caused a drop in prices – a drop that is even sharper in Alberta because the lack of pipeline capacity means its crude must sell at a discount, compared with U.S. prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The international oil glut is not Ottawa's fault. But the Trudeau Liberals quite literally own the Trans Mountain mess, having bought the existing pipeline last summer. With that purchase came all the blowback from a federal court decision stopping expansion on the grounds that some Indigenous peoples weren't properly consulted, and that the <span class="companylink">National Energy Board</span> failed to assess the impact of increased tanker traffic.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ottawa has given the <span class="companylink">National Energy Board</span> until Feb. 22, 2019, to complete the required marine assessment. It has avoided a firm deadline for consultations with Indigenous peoples, lest that be seen as violating Ottawa's duty to consult in good faith.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Albertans consequently feel left in the dark about if and when pipeline construction will begin, and angry at Ottawa.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A betting person would say the green light is likely to come sometime in the summer – there is little doubt the Trudeau government will want this off its desk before next year's election – but nothing can be soon enough at this point.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the meantime, Ottawa has offered Alberta's oil industry a $1.6-billion package of loans to help it through the slump. It can do more, too.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It could help Alberta pay for the additional rail cars needed to transport crude until new pipeline capacity comes online.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It could also do a better job of regularly communicating its plans for getting Trans Mountain through this last round of review and consultation, while consistently demonstrating that building the pipeline is job No. 1. The failure to do so is hurting the Liberal government's popularity, and the national interest.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the same time, Albertans and their politicians need to be realistic. The rest of the country is not out to get Alberta.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Trudeau government does not have a secret plot to kill its own pipeline. Being a part of the Canadian federation can sometimes test a province's patience, but that's not a reason to indulge in paranoid conspiracy theories and overheated talk of separation.</p>

<span class="companylink">Enbridge</span> is getting a $14.7-million refund on fees it paid the federal energy regulator for a pipeline it won't build. The Northern Gateway pipeline was supposed to connect Alberta's oilpatch to a port in Kitimat, B.C., but the plan started to came apart when the federal Liberals banned tankers carrying large amounts of crude oil from British Columbia's northern coast. Without tankers to serve the port, there would be no point constructing more than 1,100 kilometres of pipeline to send Alberta bitumen to Kitimat. Then the Federal Court of Appeal ruled in June 2016 that when the federal government approved the pipeline, it hadn't adequately consulted Indigenous Peoples the pipeline would affect. In November, the Liberals decided to revoke approvals given to let the project get as far as it had.</p>

Average prices are about 17 cents lower per litre than a year ago in Alberta and Ontario, 12 cents lower in Manitoba, six cents lower in Quebec, 11 cents lower in Nova Scotia and three cents lower in Newfoundland and Labrador. Prices in B.C. are up two to six cents. "I think what we're seeing here where oil prices ... are going up and down five and 10 per cent in a given week, much of this is really a harbinger of what we're likely to see in 2019, extreme price movements," he said.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Premier Rachel Notley knows exactly where she stands on this Alberta separatism thing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I say that my Canada includes Alberta, and my Alberta is part of Canada," she says in a year-end interview.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We have an obligation as political leaders to find a solution. We absolutely have to find a solution.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Nobody wins in the (separatist) scenario ... what we need to do is continue to push the federal government to get the job done and we have to show leadership in Alberta to get the job done."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Notley is on the right side of today's polls. They show that nearly 70 per cent of Albertans oppose the idea of separation from Canada, and most say it vehemently.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's still remarkable, though, that nearly 25 per cent of those surveyed had a positive attitude toward separation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Separatist feeling is a persistent theme in Alberta history when national conflict flares. A separatist party, Western Canada Concept, won a legislature seat and 12 per cent of the provincial vote in 1982.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But it's often a fleeting fancy. After capturing the Olds-Didsbury byelection that year, Gordon Kesler lost in the general election only months later.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">No matter what the provocations - and they are wildly exasperating today - the separatist idea always founders on impracticality.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Alberta's biggest modern frustration is lack of access to tidewater. There's not much hope that separation would bring an ocean any closer. It would, however, make negotiations for ocean access a great deal more difficult.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As a province, Alberta now has legal and constitutional access to every coast, no matter how theoretical that seems at the moment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As a country, however, Alberta would have no rights at all. They would need to be negotiated all over again - with Canada. Wouldn't it be fun to beg British Columbia for access to a port, with no support from Ottawa? The province best built for separation is not Alberta. It's not even Quebec, which is welded into Confederation through an ancient mesh of programs, benefits, compromises and concessions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rather, it's B.C. that has the real advantages for independence - ocean access to the world, proximity and friendship along the U.S. Northwest coast, abundant resources, a hammer lock on passage of resources to its ports, and a tough local nationalism born of early history as a Crown colony. B.C. is already acting like a country-in-waiting as it seeks control of bitumen flow through its territory by pipeline, rail or truck, while planning to build a gigantic liquid natural gas terminal and pipeline with no national oversight.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The federal Liberals never like to see separatist feeling rise in Alberta. It always concerns them to the degree that they shake their heads, send some money and wait for it to fade.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But if B.C. ever started talking separation, Ottawa would freak out. You would see plane loads of federal ministers flying over Alberta, laden with cash and concessions beyond Quebec's wildest dreams.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite all this, we should never imagine that Alberta is powerless in Confederation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Every federal cabinet minister with a functioning brain recognizes that without Alberta's resources, revenues and taxes, this whole country would suddenly face a massive deficit, rising debt, weakened services and lower standard of living.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But it's also not clear how much those resources would help an independent Alberta, because the challenges of moving them to market would be far greater than they are today.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There's also the fact that under the 1998 Supreme Court ruling on the federal Clarity Act, secession of any province is possible but extremely complicated, far more than a simple matter of passing a referendum.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For all those reasons, even public figures who foment separatist feelings don't actually advocate separation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I do not believe independence is the answer today, but the status quo is unacceptable and merely complaining about it not enough," says Derek Fildebrandt of the Freedom Conservative Party, which plans rallies on the theme "Equality or Independence."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Similarly, celebrity investor W. Brett Wilson says: "My first choice is to renegotiate Confederation. My second choice is to leave Confederation."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The difficult challenge for any Alberta premier is to change the national environment so that Alberta's resources are welcomed rather than shunned.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Notley says: "We have to make sure there is no federal leader no matter what party they're in ... that actually believes there is a path to leading this country that is in any way ambivalent or hostile to supporting a sustainable oil and gas industry."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To those who talk of independence, Notley says, "I get the frustration and anger, trust me.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I also get the worry and the anxiety, because for a lot of folks who are frustrated and angry, it's paired with the fact that they're unemployed or underemployed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"All I'm saying is that as gratifying as it might be to make the threat (of separation), it is not actually the path to the solution."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There's certainly plenty of frustration yet to come.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Notley does not expect the Trans Mountain pipeline to be under construction before Alberta's 2019 spring election.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's more likely to be the fall, in terms of the decisionmaking process and the time it will actually take."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She says there's still a great deal that Ottawa isn't able to do until the <span class="companylink">National Energy Board</span> issues another certificate for the pipeline.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After that, "my ask of the federal government is that they put absolutely every single one of their best people on it, that there is one desk with nothing else on it except that file, and that they put every single resource into that file that it needs to have, and they put more in to make sure they get it right - and then right again, and then more right."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Popular anger and even separatist pressure can help a premier with an argument like that. When a quarter of the provincial population is ready to consider independence, there is a genuine problem.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But is independence a real prospect? We're a long way from that day.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">British Columbia's government hasn't exactly acted as a bulwark of Canadian national interests of late. It's too busy blocking Alberta's ability to ship its oil via a new pipeline, while at the same time eagerly consuming said oil, building numerous pipelines to ship B.C. natural gas and enjoying the benefits of Vancouver's massive coal shipping terminal.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But it did recently do the rest of us a service, largely by accident. In calling a referendum on its electoral system, consummately bungling the job and thus producing a ringing victory for good old first-past-the-post. This is the third time B.C. has tried to sneak "reform" past its population, and the third time it's failed. In the latest vote, opposition actually increased: 61 per cent rejected the proposal; only 39 per cent favoured it. Fewer than 43 per cent of voters bothered to cast a ballot. It's the latest in a losing streak that includes failed efforts in Ontario, Ottawa and Prince Edward Island. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's Liberals abandoned a national reform plan when it became obvious Canadians weren't enthused, and didn't favour Trudeau's personal choice in any case.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With any luck, this latest failure will put to rest the notion that Canadians are mad keen on changing the way we elect governments, especially among politicians who then decry the system that got them their job and launch some convoluted effort to change it all to a system no one understands.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Electoral reform is one of those ideas, like socialism and the NHL shootout, that may sound good in theory but doesn't work well in practice. It belongs in that grab bag of brainstorms that spills open every once in a while when some bright political spark decides he/she needs a "vision" to sell to an electorate that is presumably distracted enough not to notice the details don't add up. It lives out there with that other ageless bad idea, "Hey, let's build a high-speed train from Quebec to Windsor," which overlooks the fact both terminal points are pleasant enough places that remain outside the main growth corridor precisely because of distance and the fact not enough people feel a compelling reason to go there, especially by a high-speed train that would cost billions more to build than politicians will admit or would ever be recouped.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Electoral reform might not be as pricey as pointless train projects, but shares a critical similarity in that it seeks to remedy a problem that doesn't exist. "If it ain't broke," goes the aphorism, "don't fix it." Canada ain't broken, in any way, shape or form. One of our biggest ongoing issues relates to the need to operate a fair and efficient method of handling the enormous worldwide demand from people who would rather live here than where they live now. If Canada operates a grossly unfair and inefficient means of choosing governments, all those would-be immigrants don't appear to have noticed. They just see a country that works far better than almost anywhere else.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Electoral reformists argue that the existing system isn't fair because it doesn't closely reflect the breakdown in votes; a party can get less than one vote in four and capture a majority, good for four years of power. This is definitely an oddity, but it doesn't seem to have hurt much, judging by 150-plus years of results, or by the notable absence of evidence that countries with convoluted voting systems are better run.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Denmark claims to have one of the world's "fairest" electoral systems, in that its Parliament closely reflects the breakdown in party support. That may be so, but I defy anyone to explain the system to the average Canadian voter without the help of flashcards and a Sesame Street-level simplification process. Here's a very small sample from the official Danish parliamentary website, which runs to 34 pages.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Of the nationwide 175 seats, 135 are constituency seats which are distributed among the 10 multi-member constituencies, while the remaining 40 seats are compensatory seats, which are distributed among the three electoral provinces as part of the higher tier (i.e. national) seat allocation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Thus, before an election takes place it is clearly established how many of the 135 constituency seats each of the 10 multi-member constituencies shall return. It is also known how many of the 40 compensatory seats each of the three electoral provinces shall return. Depending on the actual outcome of the election, the 40 compensatory seats will eventually be further allocated to individual multi-member constituencies within the provinces to which they were first allocated."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">No doubt Danes have a basic understanding of how this works, and it all turns out OK in the end, but is it seriously any more desirable than FPTP, which can be explained on a cocktail napkin? (The candidate with the most votes wins, the party with the most winning candidates gets to form a government. Once in a while they may have to team up with another party, but it never lasts long.) And is Denmark any better run? Electoral reform is popular mainly among parties that see it as a way of getting more power, or consolidating what they have. Canada's Greens and New Democrats think it would garner them more seats, and a bigger voice in government. Liberals think it would let them dominate the majority of future governments, by favouring left-wing groups that could then be given small, unimportant roles in a Liberal-led coalition. When Justin Trudeau declared his devotion to electoral reform, it was because his people reckoned it would be immensely beneficial to Liberal fortunes, and bad for Conservatives, whatever other impact it might have on the country. It wasn't about you, folks, it was about them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">B.C. Premier John Horgan's New Democrats got 39.7 per cent of the vote in the last provincial election, more than four points behind the Liberals. His government is propped up by three Green members. If voters were eager for more of such arrangements they would presumably have supported a change to make such coalitions more frequent. They didn't - for the third time. Quebec only lost two referendums before watching the independence notion fade; voting reformists have held four across Canada and lost them all.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I think electoral reform is finished," said deputy premier Carole James. "The public has clearly spoken. As elected officials you always know the public is right."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hah! Not always, but maybe this time, if we're lucky.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Northern Gateway pipeline was supposed to connect Alberta's oilpatch to a port in Kitimat, B.C., but the plan started to came apart when the federal Liberals banned tankers carrying large amounts of crude oil from British Columbia's northern coast.</p>

<span class="companylink">Enbridge</span> had paid the <span class="companylink">National Energy Board</span> $14.7 million in regulatory fees to monitor the pipeline's construction and operation. That was about 0.2 per cent of the estimated $7.9-billion cost of building it.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Montreal-based CN says its plan to package oil sands bitumen in soap-bar-sized pellets could help alleviate some of the transportation bottleneck in Alberta and move the oil to more lucrative markets in Asia.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CN said it has signed a memorandum of understanding with an Asian partner to build a full-scale production facility converting 50,000 barrels a day into pellets, which are formed by mixing and sealing bitumen balls with polymer, a plastic made from recycled grocery bags. The pellets are robust enough to be handled like pieces of coal, put through a conveyor system and dumped into the hold of a bulk carrier. They are designed to float, alleviating concerns of a tanker spill. The polymer is extracted and recycled at the destination through a shredding and heating process.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
James Cairns, vice-president of petroleum and chemicals at CN, said the railway plans to have a smaller pilot project converting 10,000 barrels a day to pellets in 2019, either in Edmonton or at an oil sands production site near Fort McMurray, Alta.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Cairns said a CN delegation recently travelled to China and South Korea, where they found a lot of interest in the idea. He said CN is working with some Canadian producers who are interested in tapping overseas markets to avoid the deep discount they face in the United States.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CN declined to name the Canadian or Asian companies with which it is working.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We have tested it out in the lab. We have proven the chemistry. We know it works. And the next stage is to go right to a pilot plan," Mr. Cairns said from Calgary. “After the pilot, it’s really up to the industry to see how well this gets adopted. We’re not a midstream company. We don’t own crude. We’re not going to buy or sell crude oil. We just facilitate the transportation. Our job is to put buyers and sellers together to see if this makes sense. Certainly it makes sense economically."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Benoit Poirier, an analyst at <span class="companylink">Desjardins Securities</span>, said the pellets present a long-term, viable way for Canadian oil producers to reach overseas markets, as well as an attractive growth opportunity for CN.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Western Canada’s pipeline constraints have persisted – and worsened – since 2014 as production has risen even as pipelines have been cancelled or delayed. The resulting glut of Alberta oil has sent the price of Western Canadian Select plunging compared with U.S. oil. Alberta’s government has taken the remarkable steps of imposing production cuts and announcing plans to buy oil tank cars and locomotives to move oil to markets, calling on Ottawa to help fund its purchase.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“When you have one real customer – the U.S. – and you have multiple producers and an oversupply, that just leads to the terrible differential that we have,” Mr. Cairns said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Amber Froese, a spokeswoman for Cenovus Energy, said in an e-mail that the Calgary-based oil producer is “looking at various opportunities in the area of solid bitumen on rail, but it’s very, very early days."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Edward Kallio of Eau Claire Energy Advisory said the innovation could reduce the demands on pipelines without posing a spill hazard, but needs a business case to be successful. “It’s a great idea to follow up and research," Mr. Kallio said by phone. "It’ll all come down to cost. Cost on one side and risk on the other. The environmental risk is very low so what’s the cost going to be?”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One bitumen barrel makes 600 pellets. An open-top rail car can carry about 615 barrels worth of heavy crude as pellets, once the polymer is extracted. This compares with the 390 barrels of heavy crude in a tank car, not including the dilutive chemicals.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CN says that based on current oil prices, the move to Asia is a money maker. That’s because the discount on Canadian oil at U.S. markets does not apply there. CN pointed to a study released earlier in 2018 that said it would cost about US$23 to ship a barrel of bitumen as CanaPux to Asia from Alberta, including packaging, rail and vessel charges. This is just less than the US$24 it costs to transport a barrel of diluted bitumen by train to the U.S. Gulf Coast.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One possible hurdle to CN’s plan to ship the pellets to Asia via the West Coast is the tanker ban on shipping oil, upgraded bitumen and other petroleum products from the tip of Vancouver Island to Alaska, an area that includes CN’s port operations in Prince Rupert, B.C. Julie Leroux, a Transport Canada spokeswoman, said it is too soon to say if the oil tanker ban on B.C.'s northern coast applies to the shipment of the pellets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CN says the pellets are designed to be shipped in the bulk commodity stream used for coal, which provides several different routes to overseas markets.</p>

The unemployment rate is also at its lowest in decades but Mr. Poloz said the central bank’s forecasts expect a “moderation” in economic growth, which “would only bring us to a sustainable growth track and would not be cause for concern.” Canadians are also expecting the economy to slow down, according to a new Nanos poll[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/politics/article-canadians-expect-economy-will-slow-down-in-2019-poll/] for The Globe and Mail. More than half of Canadians surveyed think that the economy will either somewhat worsen or worsen over the course of 2019, a federal election year. Seventeen per cent of those polled expect the economy to worsen and another 38 per cent expect the economy to somewhat worsen compared to 35 per cent who think it will either improve or somewhat improve. Voters’ expectations of what the economy will do during an election year should impact political debate during the campaign, according to pollster Nik Nanos. “This should be a cautionary signal in terms of a lack of confidence for the future strength of the economy and politicians should take note, because usually economic issues are a key driver of voter behaviour,” he said. The survey of 1,000 people was conducted between Nov. 30 and Dec. 5 and has a margin of error of 3.1 percentage points, 19 times out of 20.</p>

According to municipal and bankruptcy documents, the loss of revenue is estimated to be in the tens of millions of dollars.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Robert Lloyd Schellenberg, a Canadian in China, will be tried on charges of drug smuggling in Dalian on Saturday, according to[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/canada/article-canadian-to-be-tried-on-drug-charges-in-china-government-run-news/] a Chinese government-run news portal. The news could further strain the relationship between Canada and China, which has soured after China detained two Canadians following the arrest of Huawei’s CFO in Vancouver.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Toronto Mayor John Tory is pledging “steady government” moving forward after a tumultuous year that saw the election of Doug Ford and a municipal election that was influenced by the provincial government’s decision to drastically cut the number of seats in City Council. Mr. Tory sat down with The Globe’s city hall reporter Jeff Gray to talk about[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/canada/toronto/article-unavoidable-battles-lurk-as-john-tory-pledges-steady-municipal/] the year that was and what he expects in 2019.</p>

Debra Soh (The Globe and Mail)[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/opinion/article-how-to-survive-political-disagreements-with-your-family-this-holiday/] on political disagreements with family during the holidays: “I’m a big fan of keeping things short and sweet at such social events and family gatherings, or skipping get-togethers that are likely going to get contentious. In the event that this is out of your control, you can go in and resolutely refrain from talking about politics. Even if someone feels the need to go there, it doesn’t mean the conversation is destined to head south. You can change the subject and physically remove yourself, even temporarily, from the conversation.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Globe and Mail Editorial Board [https://www.theglobeandmail.com/opinion/editorials/article-globe-editorial-politicians-are-robbing-from-the-future-to-pay-for/] on deficits: “The notion that federal deficits are bad because they impose burdensome costs on future generations – rather than because of contemporary interest payments or a general aversion to big government – is a familiar conservative idea. It’s become a stock line for the leader of the Opposition. And though it has the feel of a talking point now, the thought was fresh and interesting once. It’s based on a perfectly sound principle: that the living owe something to those not yet born.”</p>

Frank Giustra (The Globe and Mail)[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/opinion/article-china-needs-friends-that-are-a-lot-like-the-canadians-it-has-detained/] on China and Canada: “The unjustified detention of my countrymen hurts China’s global stature and sends a destructive signal to everyone who wants to build bridges. It will discourage academics, members of the business community and others from visiting and engaging with the country, impacting China’s appeal for wider investment and international engagement. And it strains the long-standing friendship between our two countries, nurtured by Canada for decades – often at times when others were ostracizing China.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Dan Gardner (The Globe and Mail) [https://www.theglobeandmail.com/opinion/article-why-dont-we-care-about-climate-change/] on climate change: “Why aren’t we more concerned about climate change? By ‘we,’ I mean, of course, most Canadians. There are some who are so concerned that they despair and lose sleep over climate change. But most of us? Polls show we accept that climate change is real and threatening. And we tell pollsters we are truly, deeply worried.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Michèle Biss (Policy Options)[http://policyoptions.irpp.org/magazines/december-2018/need-fix-canadas-new-measure-poverty/] on poverty: “It is laudable for the government to seek a tool that will allow us to measure where we are, where we’ve come from and where we are going as we work to meet the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal of eradicating poverty by 2030. But for millions of people in Canada, the wrong choice of methodology could mean the difference between life and death. It is vital that in our work to address poverty in Canada, we don’t set aside the poverty experience. Every quantitative measurement must be contextualized by the real, lived experience of people who know what poverty is like first-hand. Fixing the market basket measure is our opportunity to get this right.”</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As Canadian grain companies spend millions to upgrade and build new export terminals in Vancouver, a new problem is threatening to cause transportation bottlenecks at the nation's largest port: vessels can't load grain in the rain. And it rains a lot in Vancouver.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Canada's wettest major city, the practice of loading ocean-bound vessels with grain in rainy weather has been halted since January amid safety concerns for marine crews. Every time there's a wet period, crews stop loading and wait for the skies to clear.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Vancouver terminals are generally operating on and off as the rain keeps starting and stopping,” said Wade Sobkowich, executive director of the Western Grain Elevator Association, which represents the nation's grain shippers, including Richardson International, Cargill and <span class="companylink">Viterra</span>, <span class="companylink">Glencore Plc</span>'s Canadian grain unit. Earlier this week, “there were significant weather delays during the loading process” due to the rain.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The potential delays come as the port city heads into the wettest time of the year and as grain shippers seek to move large volumes of recently harvested crops including wheat and canola. November through January is the rainiest period of the year in Vancouver and there's a chance this winter could be warmer and wetter than normal if El Nino conditions develop, said Matt MacDonald, a warning preparedness meteorologist with <span class="companylink">Environment Canada</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rail Delays</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rail transportation bottlenecks led to piles of commodities being stuck on Canada's Prairies last winter, including grain, oil and lumber. While total Canadian grain shipments have been moving at a faster pace this season, there are concerns rain could serve as another potential disruption.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Total Canadian grain exports through all ports have surged 9.3 per cent to 18.7 million tons between August and early December, up from 17.1 million tons the year earlier, <span class="companylink">Canadian Grain Commission</span> data show</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“It's been raining very heavily on the Canadian west coast. When it rains heavily it does slow down the loading of the grain vessels,” Canadian National Railway Co. Chief Executive Officer Jean-Jacques Ruest said in a Dec. 20 interview, noting the situation is unlikely to have a lasting impact on grain movement. “It's true there have been challenges in Vancouver. The last 10 days have been more challenging than otherwise.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Up until last winter, marine crews would pour grain through feeder holes in the ship's hatch cover during inclement weather or place a tarp over the hold, leaving a small opening for a loading pipe to drop in the grain. Grain needs to be protected to prevent it from getting wet, which can cause it to rot or sprout in transit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Worker Issues</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The practice was halted earlier this year after an arbitrator ruled guard rails must be erected when crews are loading vessels in the rain to prevent falls, said John Beckett, vice president of training, safety and recruitment at the <span class="companylink">British Columbia Maritime Employers Association</span>. The union representing longshore workers has also raised concerns regarding electrical grounding and staffing levels, and those issues still need to be dealt with before crews resume loading in the rain, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The impasse has so far been an “irritation” and has not had an impact on grain movement, said Mark Hemmes, president of Edmonton, Alberta-based <span class="companylink">Quorum Corp</span>., a company hired by the federal government to monitor Canada's grain transportation system. The stoppages don't often create congestion, though there is the potential it could if the city gets above-average, heavy rainfall, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“It's an irritation for them,” Hemmes said by telephone. “They wait for a couple of hours. Rain stops. Everybody goes back to work.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New Equipment</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So far, the temporary stoppages in vessel loading haven't affected the fluidity of grain movement and the industry is keeping up with rail car deliveries and unloading cars, Sobkowich said. There are hopes that trials involving the new safety equipment could start in the new year, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Loading in the rain continues to be a challenge,” Sobkowich said. “We're hopeful solutions will come forward, but they're not coming at the pace we had hoped or expected.”</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Radio City Music Hall opens</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dec. 27, 1932: Amid the Great Depression, with so many Manhattan storefronts vacant, John D. Rockefeller set out to build a complex of buildings in midtown Manhattan that would inspire everyone. The result was Rockefeller Center, and its crown jewel, at least for fans of live music and performance, was Radio City Music Hall. Nothing was spared in the ambitious art-deco design of the hall. The auditorium was the biggest in the world when it opened. The marquee is still a city block long and it’s still the largest indoor theatre in the world. One of its first tenants was the Radio Corporation of America (RCA), and its top executive christened the building “Radio City,” a catchy improvement over its original name: the International Music Hall. Audiences flocked to it until the late 1970s, when dropping attendance led the president of Rockefeller Center to announce the music hall’s closing in 1978. But the building was saved thanks in part to being declared a city landmark. Today, it is probably best known as the home of the Rockettes. But for performers and audiences alike, it remains what Rockefeller wished it would be: an inspiring place for dreamers of all kinds. – Dave McGinn</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MONTREAL — When Maxime Bernier, leader of the nascent People's Party of Canada, recently appeared on a Quebec TV news panel, the pundits laughed at his suggestion that Ottawa could force an oil pipeline through the province.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The host barely contained a smirk as he accused Bernier of wanting to shove a pipeline "down the throats" of Quebecers. "At the end of the day," Bernier replied, "the federal government has the right to approve a project or not."</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">No other leader — federal or provincial — with ambitions in Quebec would dare say something like that in public, but for Bernier the comments perfectly captured his big gamble. He is betting there are enough alienated voters in his home province and across the country fed up with status-quo politicians.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bernier, 55, who represents the federal riding of Beauce, south of Quebec City, slammed the door on the Conservative party on the eve of its August convention. The Tories, he said, were "too intellectually and morally corrupt to be reformed," and on Sept. 14 he launched the PPC.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's a challenge to do politics differently," Bernier told The Canadian Press during a recent interview in Montreal. "You saw the reactions of those pundits when I expressed a totally normal point of view," he said referring to his pipeline stance.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While he calls his policies normal, they are designed to upend the Canadian order. He proposes a drastic reduction in immigration to Canada, cutting levels by more than 40 per cent from the Liberal government's current target of 330,000 people in 2019. "I'm the only one who is saying, 'Let's take fewer immigrants,' " he said. "We want people to integrate, we don't want ghettos in Canada."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He calls his policies "smart populism," promising to shrink the size the federal government to such an extent that provinces would have no choice but to develop their own natural resources or find other ways of creating wealth. A PPC government would stop transfers to fund provincial health care.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Instead, it would give tax points to the provinces so they can collect their own health revenues. And it would not use federal dollars to pay for local infrastructure projects. Ontarians shouldn't be paying for provincial roads in New Brunswick, he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another of Bernier's core principles is to make the federal equalization program less generous. Under the program, Ottawa redistributes part of the tax money it collects to poorer provinces to ensure citizens across the country are offered comparable services.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Citizens in Alberta, who have among the top median household incomes in the country, receive nothing from equalization. In Bernier's home province, where successive governments have rejected proposals to develop the province's shale-gas or oil potential, the government is set to receive more than $13 billion in equalization in 2019.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We need to change the (equalization) formula to create incentives so that other provinces develop public policies that create wealth," Bernier said. "It's a unique vision. We are the only party promoting that."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One reason no other party has taken up the PPC's ideas could be because they would create deeper inequalities across the country, says Francois Vaillancourt, an economist with the Montreal-based research institute Cirano.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If a PPC government transfers tax points to the provinces, wealthier places such as Alberta and British Columbia would be able to collect more money per capita than the have-nots. "If you reduce equalization and transfer tax points to the provinces, that means you accept more inequalities between rich and poor provinces," Vaillancourt said in an interview.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Vaillancourt, however, says Bernier is correct that equalization doesn't encourage provinces to create wealth. "If you do nothing to become richer, you are not penalized," he said. "In the current system there is nothing that motivates a province to develop more economically than they are now."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bernier cites Quebec as a prime example, saying the province would be more open to drilling for oil on Anticosti Island or developing its shale gas resources along the St. Lawrence Valley if not for the cushion of equalization.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rather than exacerbate inequalities, Bernier says his policies would leave all Canadians with more money in their pockets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ending supply management in Canada — the system that sets prices for poultry, eggs and dairy and blocks foreign competition — would reduce grocery bills, he says. Cutting corporate taxes would attract more foreign investment and create jobs. Reducing regulation in the telecom industry and privatizing airports would open the door to competition and lower prices, he argues. And abolishing federal subsidies to corporations, he says, would save billions for regular Canadians.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He has 10 months before the next election to convince enough Canadians he's right, and his first challenge is finding the disenchanted who have stopped voting. "Thirty per cent of Canadians didn't vote in the 2015 election," Bernier said. "That's our clientele, because we are doing politics differently."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bernier claims his party is picking up momentum, with roughly 34,000 members and more than $540,000 collected in donations. He also boasted in a fundraising email sent Dec. 23 that the PPC had reached its goal of setting up riding associations in all 338 federal ridings across the country.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Opinion polls, however, indicate Bernier has much more work to do. The CBC's poll-aggregating website puts support for the PPC at 1.5 per cent nationally. A Dec. 20 poll by Ipsos didn't even include the PPC as a voting option.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While he is most popular in Alberta at the moment, he believes he can draw support across the country — even in Quebec, where his pipeline politics upset the political class.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Premier Francois Legault dismisses Alberta's "dirty energy" that would have flowed through the Energy East pipeline, which was shelved following strong opposition in Quebec. But Bernier says many people in Quebec support the project; their voices were just drowned out by environmentalists and the "elite" pundits on television.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He seems to revel in the response he provokes from those elites, claiming they fail to grasp what is at stake. "I think it's motivating and exalting when we defend ideas that are at the foundation of western civilization," he said.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Squamish Nation community was one of a handful of First Nations that lined up to convince the Federal Court of Appeal in August to overturn <span class="companylink">National Energy Board</span> approval of the controversial oil pipeline expansion from Edmonton to the West Coast, leaving its future in doubt.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the nation's acceptance of the liquefied natural gas export project last month reinforces a simple truth, says historian Ken Coates: While Canada's first people may approach tough questions differently than non-native Canadians, their decisions are motivated by many of the same factors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"These are complex issues and you're always going to have people on both sides," said the Macdonald-Laurier Institute's senior fellow in Aboriginal and northern Canadian issues and the author of several books and publications on Indigenous relations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"These are communities that need real sustainable, substantial economic benefit, where Indigenous people have been locked out of the market economy for 150 years, since Confederation. They've been wanting in for a long period of time."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Woodfibre LNG gained trust through five years of consultations and by agreeing to abide by conditions under the nation's environmental and cultural assessment process (which operates separately from federal and provincial regimes), said Khelsilem, a spokesperson for the Squamish Nation council, and one of its councillors who voted against the proposal in a close 8-6 vote.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In return for its support, the community is to receive annual and milestone payments totalling $226 million over the 40-year life of the project, and its companies will be in line to bid on $872 million in contracts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hundreds of jobs are expected to result for the nation's 4,000 members, nearly half of whom live off reserve in the Greater Vancouver area.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Khelsilem, who uses one name, said the product involved in each project - Woodfibre LNG's relatively benign natural gas versus the "extreme risk" of diluted bitumen from the oilsands in the Trans Mountain pipeline - was just one of several factors in the decision to back one and fight the other.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I think that if governments want to work with First Nations to create economic development, there's ways to do it. And our nation like many other First Nations are saying, 'We want to do it, we want to do responsible economic development and there are ways for the government to work with us on that,'" he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But, he added: "Our future isn't in the resource extraction industries like a lot of other First Nations."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The court-enforced duty of the federal government to consult, and where appropriate, accommodate Indigenous wishes when it considers projects that might adversely impact potential or established Aboriginal or treaty rights, makes their support key to both industry and environmentalists.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In November, the <span class="companylink">Montreal Economic Institute</span> released a study called "The First Entrepreneurs - Natural Resource Development and First Nations," that disputes the "widely held belief" that First Nations systematically oppose projects.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It shows that Indigenous people working in oil and gas extraction make average wages of almost $150,000 per year, while those working on gas pipelines made more than $200,000. According to a 2016 <span class="companylink">Statistics Canada</span> census the average wage of Indigenous workers nationwide was less than $50,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A few weeks later, the <span class="companylink">Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers</span> released a report called "Toward a Shared Future: Canada's Indigenous Peoples and the Oil and Gas Industry," that shows six per cent of the workers in oil and gas identify themselves as Indigenous, a total of about 11,900 people making generally better-than-average wages.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It also points out that Indigenous governments received $55 million in payments related to oil and gas activity outside of the oilsands in the second half of 2017 and that oilsands companies had spent $3.3 billion on procurement from Indigenous-owned companies in 2015 and 2016.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The message of financial gain from co-operation with industry - dubbed "economic reconciliation" - resonates with Clayton Blood, general manager of Kainai Resources Inc., a company established by the Blood Tribe of southern Alberta to pursue economic development including oil and gas exploration.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We're finding that Indigenous peoples seem to be becoming a convenient excuse for turning down some of these controversial projects when a majority of First Nations along the (Trans Mountain) pipeline route were looking for opportunities," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Environmentalists have used "scare tactics" to try to boost opposition to development on his reserve, too, Blood says, including blaming hydraulic fracturing or "fracking" of wells for methane in water wells, a problem he says existed long before fracking began.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Grand Chief Stewart Phillip, president of the Union of B.C. Indian Chiefs and an ardent environmentalist, makes it clear he thinks fracking is a problem.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He says supporting Woodfibre LNG means the Squamish Nation have chosen to prosper while damage is done to the environment of Indigenous people in northeastern B.C. where the gas is produced.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's not about money," he insists. "It's about the land, it's about the environment, it's about our culture, our traditions, our livelihood, our subsistence."</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">OTTAWA—If you look back to this time last year—before Doug Ford and the carbon tax resistance, before the Trans Mountain purchase and the alarm bells from the United Nations—climate politics in Canada look calm, even quaint.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the start of 2018, more than 85 per cent of Canadians already lived with a price on greenhouse gas emissions. British Columbians had been paying a carbon tax for 10 years. Ontario's nascent cap-and-trade regime was set to be linked with programs in California and Quebec. Even Alberta, home of the carbon-belching oil sands, was on board with its own fuel levy and tax-free emissions allocations for heavy industry.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The year started in a collaborative direction, too. Manitoba joined the Pan-Canadian Framework on Clean Growth and Climate Change in February, leaving Saskatchewan the only province that refused to sign the cross-country agreement.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But that was then.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The past year saw an eruption of conflict over Ottawa's bid to ensure a carbon price was implemented across the country by 2019. Ontario's Progressive Conservative government dismantled cap and trade[https://www.thestar.com/politics/federal/2018/10/23/carbon-tax-to-have-cash-back-in-provinces-without-levy-trudeau-says.html], and is spearheading resistance to what Premier Ford calls Justin Trudeau's “job-killing carbon tax.” Manitoba abandoned its own carbon tax plans in September, the same month Alberta Premier Rachel Notley pulled out of the Pan-Canadian Framework in protest over delays in the construction of the Trans Mountain pipeline expansion. And now Ottawa is set to impose its two-pronged carbon price[https://www.thestar.com/politics/federal/2018/10/23/heres-what-you-need-to-know-about-trudeaus-carbon-price-plan.html] in four provinces, even while they band together to challenge the federal government's authority in two separate court cases.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It makes for dramatic politics, and the confrontation over climate change and what to do about it could take a prominent spot in the national discourse during an election year, said Christopher Ragan, chair of the Ecofiscal Commission in Montreal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I think the federal election will be fought on carbon pricing,” Ragan said. “I think it will also be fought on pipelines.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The provincial opposition to Trudeau's carbon price plan has percolated for a long time; Ragan pointed out that, while Manitoba was briefly on board with the Pan-Canadian Framework, the province would only agree to a carbon tax on its own terms, set at $25 per tonne even as the federal government mandates the levy must increase to $50 per tonne in 2022. Similarly, Alberta cancelled[https://www.thestar.com/edmonton/2018/08/30/premier-rachel-notley-to-address-media-after-court-ruling-puts-trans-mountain-on-hold.html] plans to raise its own levy from the current $30-per-tonne when a court quashed the approval for the Trans Mountain expansion, which the federal government purchased earlier this year from Texas oil giant <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span> for $4.5 billion, in a bid to ensure it gets built.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But in Ragan's view, it was <span class="companylink">Ford</span>'s takeover of the <span class="companylink">Ontario PC</span> party and subsequent victory in the June election that served as the prime catalyst for the climate acrimony in Canadian politics. After all, Patrick Brown —the party's previous leader and potential premier-in-waiting—promised to swap Ontario's cap-and-trade program for a carbon tax in the province.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“If Ontario hadn't flipped, this would be quite a different debate,” Ragan said. “It would have looked like a western resistance as opposed to a bigger resistance, and in Canada that's a big difference.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In October, the Liberal government announced how it would apply its carbon price in provinces that refused to set up their own system that met federal standards. Starting Jan. 1, heavy emitters in Ontario, Saskatchewan, New Brunswick and Manitoba will have to start measuring their greenhouse gas output. By next year, those that pump out more than emissions allotment set for their respective industries will have to buy credits from their competitors or pay the carbon tax on their excess emissions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Then in April, the political doozy: The federal fuel levy will kick in at $20 per tonne of emissions. That will knock up the price of gas by four cents a litre, and climb to 11 cents a litre in 2022, when the levy hits $50 per tonne of emissions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">David Coletto, chief executive of Abacus Data, said the arrival of the levy in Canada's most populous province coincides with his firm's research that suggests Canadians are increasingly worried about the effects of climate change. There have been severe floods in Quebec and New Brunswick in recent years, as well as devastating forest fires in B.C.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And while provincial opposition to Trudeau's climate plan has increased — and could get another boost if United Conservative Party Leader Jason Kenney wins Alberta's provincial election in May — the 2019 political season could pose a challenging dynamic for the federal Conservatives as well, Coletto said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer has promised to campaign with a credible plan to curb emissions that won't include a carbon tax[https://www.thestar.com/politics/federal/2018/10/15/can-canada-fight-climate-change-without-a-carbon-tax.html]. Coletto's research shows most Conservative supporters don't rank climate change as one of their top concerns, but many Canadians outside the party mark it as a priority. So if the 2019 campaign centres on climate change, the Tory plan will need to be robust enough to win support from voters outside the party tent, Coletto said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On the left side of the spectrum, Coletto sees potential for the New Democrats or the Green Party to make the case that Trudeau's climate plan isn't strong enough[https://www.thestar.com/politics/federal/2018/11/27/un-report-highlights-inadequate-action-to-meet-paris-climate-targets.html]. Both parties already oppose the Trans Mountain expansion — Green Leader Elizabeth May was arrested[https://www.thestar.com/news/canada/2018/03/23/green-party-leader-elizabeth-may-ndp-mp-arrested-at-trans-mountain-pipeline-protest-in-bc.html] protesting the project — and environmental activists are criticizing Ottawa's decision to increase its support to the oil industry, most recently in mid-December, when federal ministers unveiled a $1.6-billion package of loans and grants to help companies during a slump in the price of Canadian crude.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Reports from the United Nations and environment commissioners in Canada have also shown the country is on track to miss[https://www.thestar.com/news/canada/2018/03/27/liberal-climate-plans-not-enough-to-meet-2030-emissions-target-new-report-shows.html] its emissions reduction target under the Paris agreement of 30 per cent below 2005 levels by 2030. And that goal already falls short of the requirements outlined in an eye-grabbing report[https://www.thestar.com/politics/federal/2018/10/09/climate-politics-heating-up-after-the-un-released-its-bombshell-report-on-global-warming.html?utm_source=Facebook&utm_medium=SocialMedia&utm_campaign=700am&utm_campaign_id=NationalNews&utm_content=ClimateChangePoliticsHeatingUp&fbclid=IwAR3uo11zpwIbzfbbH58_6X8lx1X_JjuEuYaFV6k0jahGfAG8r89Byc7jPXk] from the United Nations, released in October, that called for “unprecedented” change across sectors of the economy if the world is to avoid the worst consequences of climate change.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Is there space for a party to argue the Liberals haven't gone far enough or fast enough on this issue? I think the answer will be, does this debate just get polarized between the Liberals and the Conservatives?” Coletto said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He predicted the Conservatives will continue to frame carbon pricing as an affordability issue, arguing that the federal proposal will hurt the economy and raise the cost of living. The Liberals, however, will issue payments[https://www.thestar.com/politics/federal/2018/10/23/federal-government-rebates-to-ontarians-will-outweigh-costs-from-carbon-tax-official-says.html] to people in provinces hit by the federal fuel levy that the government says will outweigh the cost of the carbon tax for most people; the average Ontario household, for instance, will get an extra $300 on its tax return in 2019. With those payments fanning out ahead of the election, Coletto expects the Trudeau government to argue that fighting climate change with carbon pricing is a moral necessity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It all adds up to one likelihood: after an acrimonious year of climate politics, the fight will continue into the 2019 campaign season.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“This is probably the election in which climate and climate policy feature more prominently than ever before,” Coletto said.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Municipalities across Alberta and Saskatchewan are facing revenue shortfalls as several oil and gas companies have stopped paying their taxes in a bid to stay afloat – which could lead to higher bills for residents and other businesses.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Local government and bankruptcy documents peg the tax loss from energy firms still operating and those that have gone bankrupt in the tens of millions of dollars. No government body has precise figures for the tax money in arrears, but the issue is widespread and is causing friction between community leaders and the oil patch.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Saskatchewan, several rural communities are calling on the province to crack down on tax-delinquent petroleum producers. They’re also lobbying for greater powers to collect on overdue bills, including the right to place preferential liens on oil and gas properties.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“It’s a pretty big issue. We’re concerned that the problem is actually going to get worse,” said Ray Orb, president of the Saskatchewan Association of Rural Municipalities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That’s because a prolonged downturn in oil and gas prices has led to a spike in both corporate bankruptcies and idle wells in Western Canada.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A Globe and Mail investigation[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/canada/article-in-western-canada-surge-of-inactive-wells-a-brewing-disaster/] last month revealed that about 20 per cent of all oil and gas wells in Alberta, Saskatchewan and B.C. are inactive. These 122,456 wells no longer produce oil or natural gas, but have not been plugged.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">None of the Western provinces enforce cleanup timelines, but Alberta and B.C. have committed to introducing new rules and Saskatchewan is considering toughening its policies for abandoning and transferring unprofitable wells.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some in the industry, however, argue that municipal-tax policies are also contributing to the shut down of wells: industrial taxes remain fixed, even as wells age and production drops.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Few tools are available to help municipalities collect taxes from laggard energy producers. Oil and gas companies lease the land they drill on, and so there is no property to seize and sell.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Alberta, the province has stepped in to help municipalities replace the lost tax dollars that would have gone toward education. More than $3-million in credits have been granted to 37 communities since the program began one year ago, a provincial government spokesperson said. But that’s just a sliver of the total tab.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Farmers and other property owners are feeling the pinch, too, as some energy companies renege on annual lease payments to landowners for oil and gas wells. In southwestern Saskatchewan, Abbey Resources and its chief executive Jim Gettis cut its payments in half, angering many farmers. Rents can run between $1,000 and $3,000 annually for each well.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Legislation has got to be changed,” said Garry Wagner, a 68-year-old farmer who has about 30 Abbey wells on his land. “When these outfits take these wells over, they’ve got to show a business plan of how they are going to pay everybody.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Abbey Resources, which acquired 2,345 wells from <span class="companylink">Husky Energy</span>, Enerplus and a third company, also owes more than $3-million to four municipalities for two years’ worth of property taxes. Miry Creek councillor Lindsay Nobbs said the regional municipality is exploring its legal options to collect on Abbey’s taxes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“He still is operating as a company and, by right, he should be paying those bills,” Mr. Nobbs said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For property owners in Saskatchewan, there is no recourse other than the courts when energy companies reduce lease payments or stop paying altogether. In Alberta, however, the government-funded Surface Rights Board provides compensation to landowners for unpaid leases – and payouts have skyrocketed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Over the past dozen years, the board has remitted $21-million to property owners for land rents that energy firms were supposed to pay. Nearly three-quarters of that government redress has come since 2015, after oil prices collapsed. The count doesn’t include payments related to companies in the midst of bankruptcy proceedings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Because municipalities have few tax-enforcement options for oil and gas development, they often negotiate with firms looking for breaks. That was the case with Sequoia Resources before it became insolvent earlier this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the bankruptcy case, 22 Alberta municipalities filed claims for a total of $6.7-million, representing mostly unpaid taxes. The governments are not secured creditors, so they have no claim above others to any remaining value.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“What it comes down to is that when companies don’t pay their taxes, it gets passed on to the residents of municipalities,” said Heather Atkinson, a spokeswoman for Lamont County, which filed a claim of $1.5-million in the Sequoia bankruptcy, a sum representing 71 per cent of its delinquent taxes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The county of just under 4,000 residents east of Edmonton has an allowance for uncollectible taxes, but if the amount exceeds that provision, the revenue may have to be made up through tax increases, she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sue Riddell Rose, CEO of Perpetual Energy Inc., is a vocal critic of the tax regime. Even among relatively well-capitalized firms, the way municipal taxes are levied on the energy sector in Alberta has created its own serious financial problems, she contends. Sequoia bought is initial wells from Perpetual for $1.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The main issue, she said, is a disconnect between the way oil and gas wells and pipelines are assessed for municipal tax purposes and the rate at which revenue drops along with production over time. That puts aging assets at a crippling economic disadvantage, especially amid weak energy prices, she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Essentially, oil and gas production is at the highest when output begins after a well is drilled, and it drops off over time. Royalties, which provincial governments collect, reflect that. Municipal governments, however, assess taxes on the equipment. As it stands now, the depreciation allowed on equipment – the amount that its value gets written down with age – lags the decline in production by a wide margin, and as a result, municipal taxes as a percentage of operating cash flow can climb every year and render a well uneconomic, Ms. Riddell Rose said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“You get to a point for the mature assets where the taxes are so high that they’re actually causing the shut-ins," she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A provincially appointed panel looking into the natural gas industry’s struggles issued a report recently that backed up Ms. Riddell Rose’s assertions about how municipal taxes are skewed against producers. “There is evidence that legacy producers with less production per well pay materially higher property taxes per unit of production. The principle of property taxes being associated with the market value of the property is not supported by the current property tax mechanisms,” the Natural Gas Advisory Panel said in its report to Alberta’s Energy Minister Marg McCuaig-Boyd.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Canada's largest railway expects to top 2018's record crudeby-rail volumes in the new year, but is braced for any ill effects from China-U.S. trade tensions, said Canadian National Railway Co.'s chief executive officer, Jean-Jacues Ruest.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We're very optimistic about 2019. I mean, there are all kinds of clouds out there but we still see a lot of demand for freight," Mr. Ruest, a 23-year CN veteran, said. Mr. Ruest stepped into the top job in March, after Luc Jobin departed amid a storm of complaints from customers and governments over a backlog of freight that left shippers grappling with factory shutdowns and cash shortages.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rival Canadian Pacific Railway Ltd. and the big U.S. carriers faced similar complaints last winter, but at CN the network congestion appeared more severe, compounded by new traffic from the recently expanded container terminal in Prince Rupert, B.C.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CN apologized to customers and intensified efforts to hire and train new crews, and add more locomotives and rail cars, as well as increase its capacity to handle more freight by expanding yards and building new tracks on parts of its western Canadian railway.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In April, CN cut its profit outlook and posted a 16-per-cent drop in quarterly profit from the same period a year earlier as the railway construction season began.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In all, CN's capital expenditures in 2018 reached a record $3.5-billion – 25 per cent of revenue – and the company plans to spend a similar amount in 2019.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We're entering this winter in much better shape than last year," Mr. Ruest said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Christian Wetherbee, a stock analyst at Citigroup Inc., said CN has recovered more quickly than expected, even as it moves more freight. “This time last year they had just a surge of volume," Mr. Wetherbee said from New York. “That's difficult. When you're just pouring it in on one side it's going to have to come out another, and that manifested itself in some of that [service] deterioration."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The expanded capacity has helped CN meet demand from grain farmers and potash miners, as well as oil shippers facing rising production amid a persistent pipeline shortage. Mr. Ruest said CN is hauling about 140,000 tank cars of oil a year on an annualized basis – exceeding the previous peak in 2014 – and could see that volume rise in 2019.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He said CN is in talks with Alberta's petroleum marketing commission about Premier Rachel Notley's plan to purchase tank cars and locomotives to relieve the oil glut and raise producer prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When the first crude-by-rail boom of 2013 and 2014 ended, many railways were left with contracts that were unfilled and tracks that lead to shuttered terminals.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This time, railways are extracting better terms from oil shippers, including minimum volumes, multiyear contracts and higher fees, knowing the surge will last only until pipelines are built.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Crude by rail disappeared and it came back again," Mr. Ruest said. “Now we're in the cycle where there's a bigger need for the railway industry to complement what the pipeline can do and we're keen on doing that, but we will never do that to the detriment of our existing long-term commodities like potash, grain, lumber – the stuff that's been with CN when CN was created in 1919."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The year 2019 begins with stock markets in turmoil and trade tensions threatening to dampen economic growth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">Citigroup</span>'s Mr. Wetherbee said the outlook for the North American railway industry is tied to that of the broader U.S. economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Our expectation is there will be a deceleration in the pace of economic growth and therefore freight growth as we move into 2019," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Benoit Poirier, an analyst at <span class="companylink">Desjardins Securities</span>, said the China-U.S. trade spat depressed trans-Pacific container rates in December, amid signs January volumes will soften.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">However, he said ocean carriers have said the decline in U.S. imports might not be as severe as feared, and U.S. industrial production will be robust, which is good news for rail carriers.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 49-hour drive from <span class="companylink">FortisBC</span>'s liquefied natural gas facility in Delta, B.C. to Inuvik, N.W.T., is not for the faint of heart as it winds through mountain passes and frequent avalanche zones.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite the 3,615-kilometres of distance and risks, trucks carrying liquefied natural gas from southern B.C. routinely make the arduous trip to supply the 3,000-person Inuvik, an Arctic outpost close to the Beaufort Sea, with fuel for power generation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An increasing number of remote communities in Canada's northern region are using LNG as a power source because its is cheaper and less emissions-intensive than diesel, which is still widely used.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the eyes of the Northwest Territories government and the energy industry, it's painfully ironic that the Beaufort Sea contains an estimated 56 trillion cubic feet of natural gas and 8 billion barrels of oil while remote communities such as Inuvik, Iqaluit and many more rely on LNG or diesel shipped in from southern Canada for power.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We're trucking LNG all the way from Delta to burn it in Inuvik," N.W.T. premier Bob McLeod said, calling the situation a missed opportunity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Inuvialuit Regional Corp. chair Duane Smith has in recent months called for development in the Beaufort Sea so that Inuvik and nearby Tuktoyaktuk could generate their own gas-fired power, rather than importing it all the way from southern B.C.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The IRC has done a feasibility study on drilling wells in the region and Smith has said a few wells show potential.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Overall, onshore and offshore oil and gas development in Canada's North has come to a complete standstill in recent years thanks in part to the fall in oil prices, and abundant supplies in less-expensive regions like Alberta and B.C. A federal moratorium on new offshore licences in the Arctic in 2016 has ensured that drilling activity in the region has all but ceased.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jessica Shadian, the president and CEO of Arctic 360 and a professor at the Munk School of Global Affairs at the <span class="companylink">University of Toronto</span>, said there is some resentment in the territories that part of Ottawa's response to climate change has attempted to put the North "in a snow globe" so that "a bunch of people in southern Canada can feel good about it."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Shadian's group is attempting to educate investors and Bay Street banks of the economic opportunities in Northern Canada, which she says are massive.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"You have to understand Alaska, Canada and Greenland as an emerging economy," she said. At the moment, however, "Bay Street knows nothing about the Arctic."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Further, she said institutional investors would not fund projects in Canada's territories - despite the opportunities there - until the federal government adopts a long-term view for territorial economic development, including energy development.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We do not have a longterm strategy," Shadian said of Ottawa's approach.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I would not say that the federal government thinks about its north as an economic opportunity and as something that it should be paying attention to and investing in for the long-term future of Canada."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The state of inactivity in Canada's Arctic is an outlier as the U.S. tries to encourage companies to resume exploring offshore Alaska, and as other Arctic countries such as Russia and Norway are actively developing their northern frontiers despite concerns about climate change and melting sea ice.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We go to other countries and the Arctic is kind of their economic generator. We're optimistic of where we'll end up," N.W.T.'s McLeod said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">McLeod is hopeful that energy investments will return to his territory in the coming years, especially since Ottawa has agreed to restart negotiations on co-managing natural resource development with the territory.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Certainly, our GDP on the resource development side has shrunk by over $1 billion - that's close to 25 per cent (of the territory's total)," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Reversing the trend will be a challenge. Even before the moratorium, oil and gas activity had been on the decline in the region for years. There have been over 100 wells drilled in the Beaufort Sea since the 1970s, but only one in the last 20 years. Similarly, there have been 140 wells drilled in the Sverdrup Basin between the N.W.T. and Nunavut, which contains an estimated 49 trillion cubic feet of natural gas, but no new wells in the last 20 years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Major operators Imperial Oil Ltd. and <span class="companylink">BP PLC</span> announced in 2016 they would indefinitely suspend development in the Beaufort. Calgary-based Imperial and <span class="companylink">Royal Dutch Shell PLC</span> also dissolved a partnership to build the $16-billion Mackenzie Valley pipeline last year. Imperial had also shut in its Norman Wells, N.W.T., operations for close to two years but has since resumed production in the region.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Imperial declined to provide its investing plan for the region.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The federal moratorium on new exploration licences is discouraging any investment in the region, according to Paul Barnes, Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers director, Atlantic Canada and Arctic.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"If you work on your current exploration licences and find (oil), then you need to know that you can develop it," Barnes said, but he noted the moratorium signalled to oil companies that they may not ever to be able to develop exploratory blocks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To compound the problem, Barnes noted there are abundant oil and gas supplies in Canada's other regions, where operating costs are generally lower, which makes investing in the Arctic less attractive for companies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Why produce something in the North when you get it so much cheaper throughout the rest of Canada and in the U.S.?" Barnes said, but argues there could still be potential for export projects in the Canadian North.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The complete lack of activity in Canada is in sharp contrast to what's occurring in Russia, Norway and even the U.S., Barnes said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We're still seeing investments in the Arctic region, just not in Canada at the moment," Barnes said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Russia, where Moscow views climate change as an economic opportunity to open new northern shipping routes, currently generates close to 20 per cent of its gross domestic product from the Arctic region, thanks in no small part to its massive, three-train Yamal LNG facility.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Earlier this month, Russia said it plans to invest US$82 billion on regional infrastructure and natural resource development in the Arctic over the next five-year plan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Norway's government has a more measured view of melting sea ice and has implemented carbon taxes, funded carbon-dioxide sequestration technologies and other emissions-limiting technologies, but is still actively developing its northern gas resources as its legacy oil production declines.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The country's Snohvit - Norwegian for "Snow White" - natural-gas field and LNG export facility are active off the country's north coast.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In June, Norway's parliament approved the development plan for the Johan Castberg oil project in Arctic waters of the Barents Sea, at a cost of US$6.1 billion, with a scheduled start date for first oil by 2022, according to state-owned <span class="companylink">Equinor ASA</span> (formerly known as Statoil).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As American policy on climate change has whipsawed from former president Barack Obama to current President Donald Trump, the U.S. has relaxed its own moratorium on offshore oil and gas exploration and the country is now actively encouraging companies to return to the Arctic.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the new flurry of energy activity in the Arctic has alarmed environmentalists, who believe the North is particularly vulnerable and in a state of flux with melting sea ice as global emissions continue to grow.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The risks and potential impacts associated with offshore oil and gas development can be unacceptably high and are incompatible with Paris climate commitments," Simon Walmsley, World Wildlife Fund senior specialist for Arctic sustainability said in an email.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"All Arctic nations need to realize that oil and gas exploration in this unique and vulnerable part of the world will make it impossible for us to meet our commitment to keep global temperature rise to 1.5 degrees," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Climate change is a real concern in Canada's territories, where melting sea ice is readily apparent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"This is absolutely real and dynamic but at the same time people and governments are struggling with things they need to balance," said Roger Epp, University of Alberta political science professor and director of UAlberta North.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Territorial governments are looking at opportunities for economic development and employment in their regions and do so responsibly.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The resource economy has certainly been a major driver," Epp said of Canada's Northern economy, "but I think the debate has been what does the next economy look like?" N.W.T. Premier McLeod is hopeful that talks are set to resume with Ottawa early in the new year and the federal government, after years of delays, will lay out its 30-year vision for development in the Arctic.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We see the effects of climate change on a daily basis and we feel that we're doing our part," McLeod said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"All we want are some opportunities to work and to feed our families and have some opportunities for our children," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He's also hopeful the vision will include lifting the moratorium on oil and gas activity.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After a period of doubledigit growth in key markets over the past few years, Canada's real estate sector came back down to earth in 2018, broadsided by tighter rules. Home sales activity was down 12.6 per cent year-on-year in November, below the 10-year average for the month, according to the <span class="companylink">Canadian Real Estate Association</span>.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CREA expects home sales across the country to decline to the lowest point in nine years in 2019.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We are in a broad-based real estate correction in 2018, and we think that it will take the year to work its way free of the overshooting that occurred in 2014 through 2017," said Phil Soper, president of Royal Le-Page.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A key factor driving activity next year would be interest rates, which, until recently, were expected to edge higher as <span class="companylink">Bank of Canada</span> looked to "normalize rates."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The bank raised the benchmark interest rate to 1.5 per cent in July, but since then appears to have reined in its enthusiasm amid a slowing economic environment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The bank has also argued the worst in the housing market is over and markets are stabilizing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A rate pause would come as a relief to mortgage buyers at a time when Canadians'household debt to disposable income is at a record level of 170 per cent, <span class="companylink">Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation</span>'s estimates show.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another key driver in 2019 will be the looming shadow of Bill B-20, imposed in early 2018 by the <span class="companylink">Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The "stress test" required banks to assess people's ability to pay assuming interests were either two per cent higher, or greater than the five-year benchmark rate published by the <span class="companylink">Bank of Canada</span>. <span class="companylink">Royal LePage</span> and <span class="companylink">PricewaterhouseCoopers</span> predict the stress test will continue to weigh on the markets in 2019.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The days of everyone being able to have a white picket fence and a detached house of their own are rapidly receding," said Don Mc-Clintock, president of the Vancouver Island Real Estate Board.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Young people have to be prepared to live in townhouses and duplexes, and maybe even condominiums. We're going to have to change our expectations to meet the new budget."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The squeeze on millennials comes as a large demographic in the age group look to buy their first house. This will likely strain alreadysaturated markets in Toronto and Vancouver. In the Greater Toronto Area alone, 700,000 millennials will be in the market for a home in the next decade, according to a study sponsored by the <span class="companylink">Ontario Real Estate Association</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But cutting off young buyers could have sequential effects next year, says Elton Ash, RE/MAX Regional EVP for Western Canada.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"When you affect these first-time home buyers, they are the initial dominoes of what drives the market. Because as an existing homeowner, if you don't have anyone buying your house, you can't move up or move over."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Here's how Canada's four real estate markets are expected to perform in 2019: TORONTO</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">Royal LePage</span> expects the GTA market to make modest gains, with home prices rising 1.3 per cent, while RE/MAX is forecasting a two per cent gain.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Between 2017 and 2018, home sales dropped by 16 per cent, from around 80,000 to less than 68,000. With prices still at elevated levels, RE/MAX estimates this number will continue to drop next year. However, Alexander says there is no shortage of demand - immigration to the GTA will continue to have an impact on the market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Toronto is not only a big destination for Canadians, but also globally," said Alexander. "The average amount of people moving into the GTA is about 100,000 a year - we don't expect that number to decrease."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Indeed, PwC is reporting a 15-year high in net immigration to the GTA. The management consultancy ranks Toronto as Canada's top market to watch next year, with land costs expected to reach Vancouver levels by next year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">VANCOUVER</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Analysts are divided over the prospects for the Vancouver real estate market. While <span class="companylink">Royal LePage</span> forecasts Vancouver properties to stay relatively flat on average, PwC estimates a 2.9 per cent gain, and RE/MAX estimates a three per cent drop in average residential sale prices in 2019.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While the economic outlook is good, foreign buyer activity is expected to slow down. Vancouver's empty home tax, where properties deemed vacant are subject to a one per cent tax on the property's 2018 value, will continue to deter overseas buyers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But RE/MAX's Ash said the foreign buyer tax is not felt by all investors equally. While the 20-per-cent tax is off-putting to many, Chinese buyers look at the tax as "a cost to do business." He anticipates the trend will continue in 2019.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even with reduced foreign ownership, McClintock says low affordability rates will continue to be a problem next year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"When the houses in Vancouver are averaging about one million (dollars), there are some real problems of affordability."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MONTREAL</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Greater Montreal Area is expected to see the largest gains among key markets, with home prices expected to rise three per cent, predicts <span class="companylink">Royal LePage</span>. The real estate agent attributes the surge to a historically low unemployment rate and an influx of foreign buyers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While Toronto and Vancouver were galloping ahead with 20 per cent increases, says LePage's Soper, the Montreal market was relatively flat, but now "it's been discovered."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet Soper said he doesn't see Quebec's most populous city surpassing Vancouver or Toronto in foreign investment in 2019, given that inventory is tight in Montreal and building hasn't kept up with demand. He also notes Montreal doesn't have the same communities of immigrants as the other two Canadian cities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CALGARY</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Median home prices in Calgary are expected to decrease 2.3 per cent in 2019, according to <span class="companylink">Royal LePage</span>, citing persistently weak oil prices and the resulting low buyer confidence. RE/MAX estimates the average residential sales price will remain flat but could shift dramatically in 2020 because of the province's dependency on oil.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Alexander notes that in 2014 a similar oil market in Alberta and Newfoundland moved the real estate scales.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Prices did come down more than five per cent, so I think it could have an impact. Just how big will be determined by how big the oil crisis is."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Calgary's housing market remains oversupplied, with vacancy rates around 6 per cent, according to the Canadian Mortgage Housing Corp.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">However, new residents could fill up empty properties in the years to come, with the city's population estimated to grow by 26,300 annually, according to an October 2018 report by the City of Calgary.</p>

'Mad as hell': Emotions surge in Alberta over oil impasse[https://www.thestar.com/edmonton/2018/12/20/mad-as-hell-emotions-surge-in-alberta-over-oil-impasse.html]

Equalization payments and why Alberta doesn't get them: We're rich, expert says[https://www.thestar.com/edmonton/2018/12/11/equalization-payments-and-why-alberta-doesnt-get-them-were-rich-expert-says.html]
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Most of Alberta's 44 First Nations would likely choose to stay part of Canada instead of moving out with the rest of Alberta, he added.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When Quebec held a referendum on separatism in 1995, the James Bay Cree and three Iroquois reserves openly stated they would stay part of Canada if Quebec left the country.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“There's no love for the Indian Act from natives. But it's something that they know,” Dempsey said. “They've been dealing with it for over 100 years. And just to overnight get rid of it, they generally want to know what is going to replace it — and have a say in what is going to replace it.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But being connected to Canada while being physically in another country could make it even more difficult for First Nations to receive resources and services from the federal government.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dempsey said it's possible the federal government would renege on its responsibilities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“You might have Canada saying, 'It's not going to be so easy for us to support you now,' and sort of ignoring them,” he said. The federal government could then question whether Treaties 6, 7 and 8 even still applied to Indigenous people in Alberta.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He compared the hypothetical scenario to the treatment of Indigenous groups in the late 1800s, when Canadian and United States governments started looking at Siksika, Assiniboine and Ojibwa that had territory spanning both countries as either Canadian or American, separated by the borders drawn by their colonizers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“So, they would become the country of Alberta's Indians, and their responsibility, and Canada might take the position, 'Well they're not our responsibility anymore,'” Dempsey said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Feelings of alienation among Albertans are rising, according to an October Ipsos poll, as fewer residents (18 per cent) feel like their interests are represented in Ottawa (compared to 22 per cent in 2001).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More than one-third reported feeling “less committed” to Canada, and one-quarter — up from 19 per cent in the same time frame — said they believe Alberta would be better off if it separated from Canada entirely.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Treaty 6 Grand Chief Wilton Littlechild said he's watching the separatism debate “very closely.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“If it's serious, it raises a lot of very serious questions about Indigenous participation,” he said. “And my own view is that it couldn't happen without us. We would have to participate, clearly by law, in any decision like that.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">Canada's Supreme Court</span> ruled in 1998, in a case determining whether Quebec could legally separate, that Indigenous rights would have to be taken into account in any future separation negotiations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Coupled with the UN Declaration of the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, which was signed by Canada and Alberta, Littlechild said it's clear that Indigenous Canadians would have to be part of any such decision.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He noted the Natural Resources Transfer Agreement of 1930 — where the federal government gave control of crown land and resources to western Canadian provinces — would also have to be settled before Alberta could leave.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Littlechild said the separatism debate gives Canadians any opportunity to include Indigenous people in conversations around issues of mutual concern.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We do share a lot of the concerns that Albertans have when it comes to natural resources, climate change and the environment,” he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Protests heated up this month, with hundreds turning out for separate rallies across Alberta, including a truck convoy[https://www.thestar.com/edmonton/2018/12/19/massive-pro-pipeline-rally-and-truck-convoy-in-nisku-causes-massive-delays-on-qeii-highway.html] that stalled traffic for hours last week in Edmonton.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many protesters donned yellow vests and expressed anger about a range of issues, largely focusing on the federal government's inability to build pipelines to create jobs in Alberta. Some demonstrators made displays threatening or joking about violence toward Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, and some — including white supremacist group Wolves of Odin, which has been visible at the rallies — expressed anti-immigrant sentiment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If Alberta wanted its First Nations to follow suit in leaving Canada, the provincial government would have to step up and draw up new legislation to replace the Indian Act with something more desirable, Dempsey said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Alberta has a legal relationship with its eight M&#233;tis settlements, so he said establishing a relationship with other First Nations would be possible, but a lot of work.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Historically, it has been done,” he said. “Not in Alberta, but if we go back prior to Canada coming into existence, the colonies of Upper and Lower Canada, and Nova Scotia, they did have jurisdiction over dealing with the native groups within their colony.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another possible scenario, which he describes as “more of a pipe dream,” is that some First Nations with resources and economic stability might take inspiration from Alberta and break off entirely, forming their own countries.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dempsey teaches a university course on self-government, and said some believe the ultimate goal of self-government for Indigenous bands is to become their own countries.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“They would probably be ones that had some kind of economic base — oil for example — to take a position that they want to become independent themselves,” he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The logistics might be too much. But there are those that might raise the question of saying, 'Well, if Alberta's separating, then we're separating, too.' ”</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Liberals believe everyone should be looking to the government for handouts and beholden to the Liberals for taking care of them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This $1.6 billion for Alberta is a sham; we do not want it. We would rather that money be used to build the Transmountain pipeline, which the government bought under the guise of getting it built.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I cannot speak for the rest of the country, but here in Alberta, we want governments to get out of the way, leave us alone and let us prosper. We do not want handouts, we want less government.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These are not the words of a <span class="companylink">Greenpeace</span> activist or left-wing politician, but of Jim Barry, the global head of the infrastructure investment group at Blackrock — the world's largest asset manager. Barry made this statement in 2017, but the writing has been on the wall for longer than that.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Banks know it, which is why they are increasingly unwilling to underwrite new coal mines and power plants. Unions and coal workers know it, which is why they are demanding a just transition and new employment opportunities in the clean economy. Even large diversified mining companies are getting out of the business of coal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The only ones who seem to have remained in denial are U.S. President Donald Trump and non-diversified mining companies like <span class="companylink">Westmoreland Coal</span>. The Denver-based firm made a bad bet in 2013 when it purchased five coal mines in Alberta. Now it wants Canadian taxpayers to pay for its mistake.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Three years ago, Alberta's New Democratic Party committed to what some have described as “the most ambitious climate plan in North America to date." In addition to the development of an economy-wide carbon price, the province is phasing out coal-fired power by 2030. Without the infrastructure to export coal, the climate plan has also resulted in a de facto phase-out of local thermal coal mining.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To ensure support for the plan, major utility companies in the province were provided with “transition payments" to facilitate the switch to gas and renewable energy. Westmoreland did not receive a government handout, because coal mining companies have no role to play in the energy transition. The company, which filed for bankruptcy protection for its investments in the United States in October, doesn't think this is fair.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Because Westmoreland is an American company, it can rely on the <span class="companylink">North American Free Trade Agreement</span> (<span class="companylink">NAFTA</span>) for protection from “unfair" treatment. <span class="companylink">NAFTA</span> allows a foreign investor to use a process known as Investor-State Dispute Settlement (ISDS), which allows foreign investors to bypass local courts and bring claims for monetary compensation to an international tribunal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">ISDS is hugely controversial. Concerns have been raised by a wide range of actors about both the process of ISDS, and the way the system can infringe on the sovereign right of states to regulate to protect public health, human rights and the environment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More than 900 ISDS cases have been launched by investors since the early '90s, including 27 against Canada that have so far cost Canadian taxpayers at least $315 million. There is one ongoing dispute that concerns a ban on gas fracking in Quebec, but the Westmoreland claim is the first brought in relation to a policy explicitly designed to combat climate change.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Westmoreland argues that part of the reason it invested in Canada in 2013 was to diversify its holdings in response to regulatory risk. At the time, the Obama administration was taking action under the Clean Power Plan to reduce the reliance of American utilities on coal. The company's failure to anticipate similar regulatory action by its northern neighbour is remarkable.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If governments respond appropriately to the urgent warning issued by the <span class="companylink">Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) </span>in October, efforts to phase out fossil fuels will have to ramp up considerably — and quickly. We should expect the industry to fight these efforts through a variety of means. ISDS may become a key battleground.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA or CUSMA, depending on who is talking about it), which may replace <span class="companylink">NAFTA</span> (it has been signed, but has not been ratified), does not retain the process of ISDS between Canada and the U.S.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While this is good news in the long run, some have suggested that there will be a “rush of filings" before access to ISDS for already established investors expires (three years after USMCA comes into force).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other countries, particularly poorer nations, face an even higher risk of ISDS claims and have far less resources available to fight them. It is notable that big oil companies have retained some access to ISDS against Mexico in USMCA, after lobbying hard for it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If Westmoreland's case proceeds to arbitration, it will not have direct implications for Alberta's climate policy. An investment tribunal cannot require the provincial government to reverse the coal phase-out; it can only award the company damages.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Westmoreland is asking for US$470 million. It is the federal government, rather than Alberta, that would have to pay compensation to Westmoreland if the company's claim was successful.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What is more concerning than any potential payout is that Westmoreland's suit could hinder efforts to implement similar plans to combat climate change in other jurisdictions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Regulatory chill" is a phenomenon that has been observed in several jurisdictions around the world. A notable example is the decision of the New Zealand government to delay the introduction of legislation to require plain packaging of tobacco products until Australia won its ISDS case against the tobacco company <span class="companylink">Philip Morris International</span>. This delay of regulatory action — out of fear of expensive litigation — may have cost lives.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As recent forest fires and floods have demonstrated, delays in action to combat climate change can also be deadly.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Such a baroque charge won't get much traction as a hashtag or an election slogan, so Andrew Scheer must have really meant it when he accused Justin Trudeau of “intergenerational theft" this month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Tory leader levelled the accusation at the Prime Minister over the federal deficit and debt – the idea being that the next generation will one day have to pay down that red ink, so the government is effectively reaching into our grandkids' piggy banks.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The notion that federal deficits are bad because they impose burdensome costs on future generations – rather than because of contemporary interest payments or a general aversion to big government – is a familiar conservative idea.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's become a stock line for the leader of the Opposition.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And though it has the feel of a talking point now, the thought was fresh and interesting once. It's based on a perfectly sound principle: that the living owe something to those not yet born. It's a theme philosophers spend a lot of time discussing and Mr. Scheer is right to smuggle it into the political discourse.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The people of the future – the very young and the not-yet-born – are particularly vulnerable because they don't have a voice in decisions affecting them. And democracies, for all their virtues, are often blighted by short-term thinking that saddles future generations with problems not of their own making, from shaky finances to pinched infrastructure to a polluted planet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But as the list suggests, justice between generations is an idea that only makes sense if it's applied coherently – including areas of policy that Mr. Scheer is less eager to talk about.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Climate change is the clearest case of Conservative rhetoric and action parting ways. There are few issues more important to future generations than limiting greenhouse gas emissions today to ensure a liveable planet tomorrow.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet the Conservative Party is devoting the bulk of its energy to opposing a carbon tax that most conservative economists believe is the most efficient way to curb emissions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And when it comes to deficits, while the Tory leader is right that piling up debt today imposes unfair costs on the taxpayers of the future. He's wrong about the degree to which the current level of federal debt is doing this. Ottawa's debtto-GDP ratio is by far the lowest of any <span class="companylink">Group of Seven</span> government and it's falling.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At this rate, the country's grandchildren will hardly be stooped under the bondholder's yoke.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although the federal debt burden isn't large, the federal budget is in deficit. And Canada's Class of 2050 can feel let down by the reason for the excess of spending over revenues.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2015, the Liberals sold deficits as a way to update the country's bridges, roads, broadband and public transit. The plan was to run small deficits to build infrastructure – an investment in the future. Instead, the deficit is being driven by spending on things such as the Canada Child Benefit – which, even if it is a good idea, is current consumption. It's borrowing to spend in the present, for the present.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The commuter of 2038, whose trips to and from work are faster, cheaper, easier and less polluting because Toronto finally built another subway line, doesn't vote in the 2019 federal election. But the middle-class parent who gets an extra $2,000 cheque does.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Here's another question about intergenerational fairness: Who should benefit from non-renewable resources? Is some of the wealth owed to future generations?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the 1970s, Alberta thought so. It created a savings fund to sock away some of its oil revenues. When Norway became a major oil producer, it did likewise. But after oil prices dropped in the 1980s, Alberta stopped saving. Norway, in contrast, for decades has been investing a big chunk of its oil revenues. The <span class="companylink">Alberta Heritage Savings Trust Fund</span> is worth $17.6-billion dollars. Norway's fund is worth about $1.3-trillion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lucky future Norwegians – thanks to the foresight of past Norwegians.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Deferred gratification is hard, especially with elections every four years and people struggling to make ends meet or keep up with the Joneses. But Mr. Scheer is right: “Intergenerational theft" is a real problem, if not exactly the one he imagines.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">G.K. Chesterton called tradition the “democracy of the dead." Our democracy needs to pay more heed to the not-yet-born.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Could one of them be a breakthrough for the Green Party of Canada in next year's federal election? Elizabeth May's party has flattered to deceive before, but a number of leading indicators suggest a resurgence in Green fortunes.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While they are in familiar territory in most public polls - between 7 and 10 per cent - there are signs that suggest their support has room to grow.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Most promising was a question in a <span class="companylink">Nanos Research</span> poll on the party voters might consider at the next election. It suggested that one in three voters would think about voting Green, up from one in five before the 2015 election. Green leader May is also outpolling NDP leader Jagmeet Singh on the question of who voters prefer as their prime minister.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Party fundraising, a key measure of support, is up 19 per cent in the first three quarters of the year, albeit from a small base.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">David Coletto, a pollster at Abacus Data in Ottawa, said he thinks the political environment is opportune for the Greens.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Concerns about climate change are growing, the Liberals are vulnerable on the environment after buying a pipeline, the NDP is in retreat and voters are looking for something different, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"May appeals to folks who are looking for a kind, thoughtful leader without flash. It will require a lot of work on their part but I think their prospects have never been more favourable," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">May herself thinks the auspices have never been better, even under a firstpast-the-post system she decries.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In past elections, May has always had to battle for a spot in the leaders'debates, often in the face of concerted opposition from the Conservatives and New Democrats.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But in the next election the question appears settled, after the Liberals appointed former governor general David Johnston as Canada's first debates commissioner. He will organize two debates, and the Greens appear to meet the criteria for inclusion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In past elections, strategic voting has hurt the party - from its standing in the polls late in the 2015 campaign, for example, its vote was cut in half to just 4 per cent on election day.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Green voters have often switched to the Liberals or NDP late in campaigns, over concerns the party cannot get its candidates elected. "We run into a wall of lastminute strategic voting," May said in an interview.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But including May there are now 10 elected members at the federal and provincial levels across four different provinces.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Federally the party is benefiting from disillusionment with Justin Trudeau's Liberals. Unusually, multiple candidates are seeking the party's nomination in the North Vancouver riding, and in the Esquimalt-Saanich-Sooke constituency on Vancouver Island, the Green candidate, David Merner, ran for the Liberals last time. He quit the governing party the day it bought the Trans Mountain pipeline.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By the time the federal election rolls around there may even be a Green provincial government in Prince Edward Island, where Peter Bevan-Baker's party has been ahead in three of the past four public polls.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Part of it is that people are sick of the old-line political parties," said May.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another factor is that climate change is more tangible to voters. From flooding in New Brunswick to forest fires in British Columbia, May said people are feeling the effects viscerally. "People don't need to be told that climate change is real and that we're in a climate emergency. It's no longer an environmental issue, it's an existential security threat."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">May said part of her challenge is to make sure no region of the country is disadvantaged by the shift to clean sources of energy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Perhaps surprisingly, her party does not propose going "cold turkey" on oilsands development.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She instead supports policies once proposed by former Alberta premier Peter Lougheed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"If I were (current Alberta premier) Rachel Notley, I would have wrapped myself in Lougheed and repeated his mantra: 'The first rule of oilsands development is think like an owner,'and gone back to the first principles of value-added."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">May, like Lougheed, advocates the construction of refineries and shutting down the importation of 700,000 barrels a day of oil from countries like Saudi Arabia into eastern Canada.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is a persuasive argument but one that ignores the economic reality. There is a surplus of refining capacity in North America, while many of the refineries in Canada are not configured to process the heavy crude being produced in the oilsands. There have been no new refineries built in this country for 30 years and though Notley's government is exploring the possibility of building one, at a cost of up to $15 billion per plant there is not a lot of optimism one will be built any time soon.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, May's message is that there should be a gradual shift away from fossil fuels.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Her emphasis is on de-carbonizing electricity generation, by moving from coal to renewable energy sources. She criticized Notley's government for "squandering a golden opportunity" as it moved away from coal generation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Alberta has the best opportunity for solar energy of any province in Canada," she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We can design a plan that gets us to 1.5 degrees Celsius but it starts with decarbonizing our electricity grid, moving to electric vehicles, looking at transportation and land-use and ensuring the oilsands (emissions) don't grow beyond 70 megatonnes a year," she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">May's pitch to Canadians is that Green MPs will work across party lines and rid the country of "old-fashioned, hyper-partisan, nasty politics."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I'll be campaigning on honest, hope," she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The federal government needs to offer tangible acts of leadership that mobilizes the profound sense of anxiety ... We need to let people know that we'll get through it in fine shape, as long we don't kick it down the road for some other generation to solve."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is an appeal that might find a sympathetic audience next year. On the other hand, the Greens could just as easily pass from rising hopes to has-beens in the course of an election campaign.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Much will rest on May's performance. She is a decent, smart hard-working politician who actually reads legislation and makes sensible interventions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the same time, she is not for everyone. She never uses a sentence when a paragraph would do, her sense of humour is no laughing matter, and she is still living down the Press Gallery dinner three years ago when she brought her party into disrepute with a performance that included a memorable shout-out to Omar Khadr, the convicted terrorist (she blamed fatigue and the flu for the meltdown).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If she is going to repeat the success experienced by the late Jack Layton in 2011, it is going to require her to keep calm and to articulate a consensus that is still in the process of forming.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Emma McIntosh: As an investigative reporter, I love wading into stories that take a long time to unpack. My favourites get under my skin and stay there — they either fascinate me so much that I spend months obsessing over them or make me feel something difficult to capture. The stories on this list are the ones I still think about often. I feel lucky to have spent this year sharing them with you.</p>

Journalism can be a dizzying and frustrating experience, for reporters and readers alike. It's refreshing and encouraging to be afforded the time to dig deeper into issues by cultivating well-placed sources and obtaining obscure records through access to information laws. Few things brighten my day like the sight of a bulky manila envelope stuffed with documents hinting of an exclusive story that, fingers crossed, will enlighten and empower citizens, hold officials accountable, and result in positive, incremental, change. These are a few of my favourites that, I'd like to think, accomplish at least one of those ideals.</p>

The impact our leaders' decisions have is part of the equation, but democracy entails much more than that.

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Adjunct research professor in the Institute of Political Economy at <span class="companylink">Carleton University</span>, and senior policy adviser to the Broadbent Institute</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Partly fuelled by reports from conservative think-tanks such as the <span class="companylink">Fraser Institute</span>, many Canadians believe that they are taxed far too heavily and that the tax “burden" has been rising over time. Recently published <span class="companylink">Statistics Canada</span> data show, in fact, that most individual Canadians pay very low effective rates of personal income tax, and that the tax “burden" has been falling.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many studies calculate the average income tax rate as total income taxes as a share of total income. This is fine as far as it goes, but it ignores the fact that effective income tax rates increase a lot as income rises from those with little or no taxable income, to average earners, to very high income taxpayers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The new <span class="companylink">Statistics Canada</span> data provide calculations of effective personal income tax rates at various points on the income spectrum. The numbers look at federal and provincial personal income tax paid as a share of total individual income. (Other data include federal payroll taxes.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2016, the “average Canadian" paid an effective combined federal-provincial income tax rate of just 9.0 per cent – just nine cents for every dollar of income from employment, investments and government transfers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While that figure does not include sales taxes and social insurance contributions, it will surely strike most as quite a modest amount considering all of the benefits of public spending in the form of income support programs, social programs and public services.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The great majority of Canadians pay much less than the average effective income tax rate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Indeed, one in three (30.6 per cent) of all tax filers pay no income tax at all, since their credits and deductions exceed their income. Almost half of all tax filers (44.0 per cent) pay an effective rate of less than 5.0 per cent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Middle-class earners also pay quite modest amounts of income tax. The effective rate paid by someone in the 75th percentile (just 25 per cent of tax filers earn more, while 75 per cent earn less) is 15.8 per cent on an income of $57,600.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2016, the incomes of the top 1 per cent of all tax filers averaged $244,300. They paid an average effective personal income tax rate of 30.6 per cent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While that figure may sound high to some, it does not adjust their incomes for the fact that only half of capital gains income is treated as taxable income, and that there are special tax breaks for other forms of investment income such as dividends.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The data also rebut the common view that the income tax “burden" has been increasing. In fact, the average effective rate has fallen from a peak of 11.3 per cent in 1997, two decades ago, to 9.0 per cent in 2016, and the effective rate on the top 1 per cent has fallen from 34.5 per cent at the peak in 2007 to 30.6 per cent in 2016. The effective tax rate on the 75th percentile has fallen from 19.1 per cent to 15.8 per cent over the same period.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So why all of the populist tax rage? One can only speculate, but perceptions are clearly not being shaped by the facts. Stagnant or falling real incomes for many Canadians are the result of low rates of growth of earnings and other forms of income, not rising income taxes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The data also show some interesting differences between provinces. While the effective federal rate is quite uniform across the country, effective provincial rates average 3.6 per cent for all of Canada and range from a high of 5.5 per cent in Quebec to a low of 2.2 per cent in British Columbia and 3.0 per cent in Alberta.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The effective provincial income tax rate on the top 1 per cent averages 11.8 per cent, but varies from a low of 8.4 per cent in Saskatchewan to a high of 17.0 per cent in Quebec.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One pertinent observation is that Quebec taxpayers pay quite a bit more in provincial income tax to fund that province's social programs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Oil patch critics of the equalization program should at least acknowledge that fact.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A decade ago, the <span class="companylink">Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives</span> released a report, Canada's Quiet Bargain, which argued that the vast majority of Canadians gain much more from public programs than they pay for in taxes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Certainly the tax data continue to bear this out.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Natural gas prices in Western Canada are so low that a partner in the country's first LNG export project is shutting off money-losing wells and throttling back its exploration program.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Malaysian-owned Petronas, which has a 25-per-cent interest in the $40-billion LNG Canada project, has been curtailing production by between 50 and 200 million cubic feet per day from wells in northeastern B.C. capable of producing 700 million cf/d, the CEO of its Canadian branch says.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The practice is being adopted by a growing number of western Canadian producers to avoid selling their natural gas at prices that often don't even cover the cost of pipeline transportation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We talk a lot about oil infrastructure," CEO Mark Fitzgerald of Petronas Energy Canada Ltd. said in an interview, referring to oil price discounts in Western Canada blamed on full pipelines. “Gas is trapped as well and if you compare the prices that Canadian gas producers are receiving against our U.S. peers, the differentials are significant and costing us a significant amount of money."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The company invested heavily in natural gas exploration in northeastern B.C. from 2012 to 2016, employing more than 25 drilling rigs at peak times to prove the resource potential as part of its longer-term plan to build a liquefied natural gas export terminal. It is running only one rig now, Mr. Fitzgerald said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Petronas backed out of its $36billion Pacific NorthWest LNG project in 2017, but joined the LNG Canada partnership led by <span class="companylink">Royal Dutch Shell</span> last May.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The partners agreed to go ahead with their project this fall, but it isn't expected to be ready to begin supercooling natural gas and shipping it out until late 2023 or early 2024.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ian Archer, an associate director with <span class="companylink">IHS Markit</span>, said Western Canada's gas industry was stable from 2000 to 2008, with production of about 16 billion cf/d and prices of around $10 per gigajoule, but that changed when new drilling and well-completion technologies emerged that allowed the U.S. to dramatically increase shale gas production.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Cheaper U.S. gas began displacing western Canadian gas in markets such as California, Eastern Canada and New York, and the price in Western Canada dropped by half, with production falling to around 13 billion cf/d by 2012, he said. The trend worsened when the new drilling technologies began to be used in northeastern B.C. and northwestern Alberta to produce light oil products like condensate, which is in demand as a diluent to mix with raw bitumen from the oil sands to allow it to flow in a pipeline.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Condensate wells also typically contain high levels of natural gas and the boost in gas production back to over 16 billion cf/d has overwhelmed pipeline capacity and dropped gas prices this year to a projected $1.43 per gigajoule, about one-third of the price in 2014, Mr. Archer said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pipeline companies are spending billions of dollars to expand their gas systems in B.C. and Alberta, which will improve market access, but it's difficult to see where the gas can be sent to win better prices, Mr. Archer said.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CALGARY — Natural gas prices in Western Canada are so low that a partner in the country's first LNG export project is shutting off money-losing wells and throttling back its exploration program.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Malaysian-owned Petronas, which has a 25 per cent interest in the $40-billion LNG Canada project, has been curtailing production by between 50 and 200 million cubic feet per day from wells in northeastern B.C. capable of producing 700 million cf/d, the CEO of its Canadian branch says.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The practice is one being adopted by a growing number of western Canadian producers to avoid selling their natural gas at prices that often don't even cover the cost of pipeline transportation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We talk a lot about oil infrastructure," said CEO Mark Fitzgerald of Petronas Energy Canada Ltd. in an interview, referring to oil price discounts in Western Canada blamed on full crude pipelines.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Gas is trapped as well and if you compare the prices that Canadian gas producers are receiving against our U.S. peers, the differentials are significant and costing us a significant amount of money."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The company invested heavily in natural gas exploration in northeastern B.C. from 2012 to 2016, employing more than 25 drilling rigs at peak times to prove the resource potential as part of its longer-term plan to build a liquefied natural gas export terminal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is running only one rig now, Fitzgerald said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Petronas backed out of its $36-billion Pacific NorthWest LNG project in 2017, but joined the LNG Canada partnership led by <span class="companylink">Royal Dutch Shell</span> last May.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The partners agreed to go ahead with their project this fall, but it isn't expected to be ready to begin supercooling natural gas and shipping it out until late 2023 or early 2024.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ian Archer, an associate director with <span class="companylink">IHS Markit</span>, said Western Canada's gas industry was stable from 2000 to 2008, with production of about 16 billion cf/d and prices of around $10 per gigajoule, but that changed when new drilling and well completion technologies emerged that allowed the U.S. to dramatically grow shale gas production.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Cheaper U.S. gas began displacing western Canadian gas in markets like California, Eastern Canada and New York, and the price in Western Canada dropped by half, with production falling to around 13 billion cf/d by 2012, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The trend worsened when the new drilling technologies began to be used in northeastern B.C. and northwestern Alberta to produce light oil products like condensate, which is in demand as a diluent to mix with raw bitumen from the oilsands to allow it to flow in a pipeline.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Condensate wells also typically contain high levels of natural gas and the boost in gas production back to over 16 billion cf/d has overwhelmed pipeline capacity and dropped gas prices this year to a projected $1.43 per gigajoule, about one-third of the price in 2014, said Archer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, the U.S. benchmark Henry Hub spot price is forecast to average US$3.17 per GJ in 2018 (about C$4.12), according to the <span class="companylink">U.S. Energy Information Administration</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pipeline companies are spending billions of dollars to expand their gas systems in B.C. and Alberta, which will improve market access, but it's difficult to see where the gas can be sent to win better prices, Archer said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">LNG Canada's first phase is expected to require about two billion cf/d of gas to produce about 14 million tonnes per year of LNG, but most of that gas is expected to come from the partners, so a big price improvement isn't expected, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The best hope of better prices is stronger demand from additional LNG facilities, conversions of coal-burning power plants to gas and more growth in the oilsands, where natural gas is used to produce steam and power, Archer said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mike Rose, CEO of Tourmaline Oil Corp., says his Calgary-based company froze gas production at about 1.35 billion cf/d at the end of 2017 because of low prices and has switched its focus since to oil production growth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Gas marketing is more important than ever, he said, as Tourmaline tries to move more gas to any hub that offers better prices than those in Alberta or B.C.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's the most challenging time that I've ever seen in the Canadian oil and gas sector by a long shot."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Alexandra Gill[https://twitter.com/lexxgill] has been reviewing restaurants for The Globe for the past 13 years. With careful, knowledgeable and precise curation, she reviews everything from the establishments of celebrity chefs to the neighbourhood hole-in-the-wall to the unassuming but exquisite sushi joint. Along the way, she uses food terms that I, as her editor, have to scurry to look up, increasing my paltry foodie knowledge as I go.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Here are her thoughts on what is trending in food and restaurants:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">You’ve got a sushi restaurant at the top of your list this year. Sushi is ubiquitous in Vancouver, but is there a movement to think of it as top-tier dining?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We do have a lot of sushi in Vancouver, but a lot of it is fusion or creative sushi, which includes gussied-up rolls or aburi (torched) sushi that is masked with elaborate garnishes. We’re seeing more small spots serving classic sushi, but they’re still fairly mediocre -- poorly cut fish that’s treated homogeneously. An excellent sushi restaurant pays attention to freshness and the way it’s been preserved (brined, aged, etc.), seasonality, the temperature at which it’s served, the flavours (and quality) of the garnish, the extra cuts or scoring on each piece to bring out its full flavour, the assortment of fish types (creamy, fatty, briny) and the progression in which the pieces are served. There is so much care that goes into high-quality sushi. At the top sushi restaurants in Japan, the chefs will even adjust the rice temperature for various types of fish.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tetsu Sushi Bar is by no means fancy. It’s just a bare-bones hole-in-the-wall with 13 seats. But I would consider it high-end. The prices are up there, but less expensive than Tojo’s (famous for its creative sushi) or anything comparable in Japan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Interestingly, one of Canada’s best top-tier Japanese restaurants – Shokunin – is in Calgary. And it’s run by a non-Japanese chef, Darren MacLean, who recently was the only Canadian competitor on <span class="companylink">Netflix</span>’s The Final Table. I haven’t been to Shokunin, but Dan Clapson certainly liked it[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/life/food-and-wine/restaurant-reviews/despite-some-abysmal-first-plates-shokunin-deserves-another-chance/article31087585/] .</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What are the trends to look for next year?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Plant-based everything. When Earls rolls out a plant-based menu (which it did this year), you know the trend has gone mainstream. Even the new Canadian Food Guide recommends more vegetables. It’s time Vancouver restaurants caught up. You actually see more progressive vegetarian restaurants in beef-loving Alberta (Dan included Edmonton’s The Moth Café in his list this year) than you do in Vancouver. This has always puzzled me. Vancouver gave the world Greenpeace, Daiya “cheese” and Yves Veggie Dogs, but most restaurants still offer mushroom risotto as their vegan feature.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Are there different tastes in different parts of Western Canada? In different parts of the city?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tastes in different cities generally reflect the history of immigration patterns. Vancouver excels at Chinese food, Calgary has great Vietnamese restaurants, Toronto has all the terrific Caribbean flavours I wish we had more of here.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But a city’s restaurant composition also caters to the needs of diners. Victoria has a great lunch scene, probably because there are more government workers downtown. Calgary has (or did when the oil industry was booming) a busier weekday night scene because people were wining and dining on corporate expense accounts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Does price necessarily equate with a better dinner experience? Has that changed?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Oh, that’s a tough question. It’s so subjective. Some of my favourite, go-to meals cost $12 (Marutama Ramen, for one). And some people have trouble understanding that you’re paying for more than just food in a restaurant. Great service, comfortable chairs, a well-stocked wine list, clean linen, property taxes – those things all cost money.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But I do believe that the prices in Vancouver’s top restaurants are low compared to Toronto, Montreal and major cities in the United States. They’ve been creeping up the last couple of years and will continue to do so. The costs of food, rent and payroll (restaurant workers, especially cooks, are rightfully demanding better wages) are all going up, and menu pricing must reflect that.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Around the West:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">ELECTORAL REFORM REFERENDUM: It’s the third strike for electoral reform in British Columbia, and as a result, anyone advocating for a change in the way voters elect their government is out of luck.[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/canada/british-columbia/article-british-columbians-reject-electoral-reform-for-third-time-in-13-years/] Deputy Premier Carole James and Green Party Leader Andrew Weaver, who campaigned hard in favour of change, said this week the issue of whether to switch to proportional representation is a dead one for at least the forseeable future. Less than half of eligible voters returned their mail-in ballots, and 61 per cent of them chose to keep the current system. It was a decisive drubbing for electoral reform, comfortably surpassing the simple majority the provincial NDP said was necessary. In fact, the defeat equaled that of the 2009 referendum and surpassed the defeat in 2005.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The vote is sure to be a blow to other jurisdictions in Canada – Ontario and Prince Edward Island – where voters are looking for a better way. The failure of the vote could also affect the comfortable relationship the NDP has enjoyed with the Green Party. The Greens supported the NDP minority government in exchange for a commitment to hold a referendum on electoral reform. The Greens had hoped a change in the way British Columbians elect their provincial representatives would help their candidates in coming elections. With those dreams dashed, the Greens will be looking for ways to ensure their agenda is clear and distinct from that of the New Democrats.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">ALBERTA OIL: Premier Rachel Notley is ending the year by escalating her fight with the federal government over its treatment of the oil-and-gas sector as she attempts to respond to growing resentment in her province and prepare for a provincial election campaign in the spring. Two cabinet ministers visited the province this week to unveil a $1.65-billion aid package[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/canada/british-columbia/article-ottawa-offers-16-billion-boost-to-struggling-oil-sector/] for struggling oil producers, mostly in the form of commercial loans. Ms. Notley quickly dismissed the plan as poorly thought-out and not even what Alberta is asking for. She says companies do not want to go deeper into debt, and what they really need is quicker access to export markets — through expanded shipments of oil by rail in the short term and, eventually, the expansion of the Trans Mountain pipeline. She’s also warning that federal environmental legislation[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/canada/alberta/article-alberta-premier-notley-steps-up-criticism-of-federal-energy-plan/] could mean the end of private investment in new pipelines.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">OVERDOSES: A city task force in Vancouver is calling for[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/canada/british-columbia/article-vancouver-overdose-emergency-task-force-calls-for-expanded-harm/] additional supervised drug-consumption sites, including an outdoor space to inhale drugs, additional facilities in single-room hotels, and a mobile option. Mayor Kennedy Stewart, who was elected in the fall, created the task force after taking office, in response to a persistent overdose crisis that has killed thousands of people in B.C. — many of them in Vancouver’s Downtown Eastside. Figures from the provincial coroner suggest an increasing number of people are overdosing after smoking their drugs, rather than injecting them, which suggests the existing indoor supervised-injection sites may not be enough.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">DETAINED CANADIAN: An Alberta woman who became the third Canadian detained in China amid deteriorating relations between the two countries could be coming home soon. Sarah McIver, who was in China teaching English, was arrested over what Chinese officials have described as an issue with her visa. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau says the detention is not related to the cases of two other Canadians — a former diplomat and a businessman — which are widely seen as retaliation for the arrest of a senior executive of tech giant <span class="companylink">Huawei</span>. According to a friend of Ms. McIver,[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/canada/alberta/article-third-canadian-detained-in-china-told-her-family-she-would-be-home/] she has told her mother she is okay and would be released and deported to Canada after 10 days.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">RCMP IN SURREY: The newly elected mayor of Surrey, B.C., came to power on a promise to ditch the RCMP and create a new municipal police force — a plan that is now facing criticism for being unrealistic. Last week, Jack Hundial, a member of the mayor’s Safe Surrey Coalition, said he doubted the transition could be done within two years. Mr. Hundial is a former Mountie. But Mayor Doug McCallum, who has repeatedly declined to answer questions about his policing plan or other topics, insists the new force will be up and running ahead of schedule.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CHRISTMAS IN THE DOWNTOWN EASTSIDE: Vancouver’s yearly Christmas traditions — the large Christmas tree at the art gallery, the skating rink at Robson Square, the Santa Claus parade — usually leave the troubled Downtown Eastside neighbourhood untouched. But it’s a different story this year, as a large tepee in the heart of the community is transformed, with a costumed snowman outside directing visitors in to meet a special guest: Santa. Andrea Woo visited the tepee[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/canada/british-columbia/article-christmas-tepee-in-vancouvers-downtown-eastside-lights-up-bleak/] , and Santa (played by Joseph Konkin, a 59-year-old homeless street vendor) and discovered that the grim milieu of the Downtown Eastside can also offer a profound sense of community support among grief and heartache.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Opinion</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Campbell Clark[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/politics/article-trudeaus-16-billion-oil-and-gas-assistance-package-wont-heal/] on the aid package for Alberta: “But neither the money nor the sympathy are really going to assuage Albertans’ anger, driven by a long slump in oil prices and a damaging local glut exacerbated by a lack of pipeline capacity. Frustrated that no one is fixing it fast enough, that anger is directed, in large part, at Mr. Trudeau’s federal Liberals.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Trevor Tombe[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/opinion/article-why-equalization-is-not-unfair-to-alberta/] on equalization: “Only the equalization program itself is unequal. But that’s deliberate: Some provinces have an easier time raising revenue than others, so equalization provides additional funds to lower-income provinces to ensure adequate public services can be provided to all Canadians.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Adrienne Tanner[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/canada/british-columbia/article-what-the-school-tax-teaches-us-about-the-vancouver-greens/] on Vancouver Greens' approach to the school tax: “For the Greens, it was a hint of far more challenging decisions to come on issues that don’t fall neatly into their environmental agenda. One of the most interesting things about 2019 will be watching them sort out where they stand.”</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The last federal election campaign was one of the longest in Canadian history. But if you thought the 78-day election of 2015 was a prolonged drama, wait until you see what's in store for next year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Essentially, the political year of 2019 will be a three-act play.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There's the official campaign, due to kick off in early to mid-September, when Prime Minister Justin Trudeau visits the Governor General and kicks off Canada's 43rd election, set for Oct. 21.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Then there's the newly established "pre-election campaign," which is now a formal time period under election-reform legislation passed by MPs and senators just before they left for the Christmas break. This new pre-election period, which features rules of engagement and spending limits for all political participants, gets underway on June 30, meaning that politicians of all stripes will be electioneering in earnest on the usual summer barbecue circuit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And then there's the unofficial, election-positioning period for 2019, which starts pretty much as soon as the New Year's festivities are over. In other words, almost all of 2019 - 294 days, if you like - will be an election year in federal politics.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Long election campaigns can be brutal on political players but they can be good citizenship exercises. The 2015 campaign, for instance, resulted in a marked increase in voter turnout - a nearly 10-percentage-point increase over the 2011 turnout numbers, and much of it because of a surge in participation from young people and Indigenous Canadians.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That lengthy campaign also featured some significant debates over policy and issues, such as whether Canadians' thinking about deficits had evolved, or how open this country was to refugees and people wearing religious clothing. The fact that the campaign unfolded against a global backdrop of a Syrian refugee crisis, we'll remember, also introduced a rare foreign-policy component in a domestic election.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So what will Canadians get out of a nearly 300-day election campaign - unofficial, pre-election and official - in 2019?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Well, it's entirely possible that there will be a serious debate or two over policy. Parties on both sides of the issue have said they will be delighted to fight a campaign over climate change and carbon pricing in Canada. As well, ongoing global developments, especially when it comes to migration and refugees, promise to keep those topics on the front burner of Canadian politics.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But it would be a mistake to assume that Canadians are in the same mood about foreign policy in 2019 as they were in 2015. Canada-U.S. relations have radically transformed, for instance. Donald Trump was not even a serious presidential contender when Canada last went to the polls; now President Trump is a dominant influence in Canadian politics.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many of the political developments in Trump's America have been bleeding over into Canada since he went into the White House, too - and that's bound to continue while this country moves into election gear.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2019, it may not be foreign policy but foreign interference that elbows its way into our electoral politics. Several warnings have already been sounded from security and other officials.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">None other than Karina Gould, Canada's own minister of democratic institutions, has said that it is "virtually impossible" to thwart foreign interference in elections, even though her government's new election legislation takes some steps in that direction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Based on our research ... on global elections, foreign players could use social media platforms to influence the voting" of Canadians, Gould testified before the Senate in November.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Gould was highlighting another big difference we'll be seeing between the 2019 election and the last one. Four years ago, social-media platforms such as <span class="companylink">Facebook</span> and <span class="companylink">Twitter</span> were seen largely as a force for good in Canadian politics: a way to boost participation and voter interest. Now, in the shadow of controversy over the data-mining firm Cambridge Analytica and its role in Trump's 2016 campaign, enthusiasm for Big Data is more muted. All the parties still need the high-tech tools of micro-targeting and databases, but they won't be boasting about their mastery of that universe as they once did.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As for <span class="companylink">Twitter</span>, Trump has helped turned that medium into dangerous, unpredictable terrain for politics in 2019. If the Canadian federal election of 2019 is going to turn ridiculous, <span class="companylink">Twitter</span> will no doubt be ground zero.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In three other ways, the next year in politics will also see some departure points from past campaigns. If we're still thinking in sets of three for the next year in politics, you could call them the three P's: populism, personality and the provinces.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The inevitable populism element of Election 2019 is also an offshoot of the Trump effect on Canadian politics, even though populist anger is also emerging as a major force in elections all over the world. All Canadian parties know that there are pockets of populist discontent all over the country, especially in areas hit hard by economic decline - in oil-price-ravaged Alberta, for instance, or in Oshawa, where <span class="companylink">General Motors</span> is pulling out of town.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Populism tends to rear its head in election campaigns as protest votes against governments in power, so it'll be worth watching how the 2019 budget is framed. It will likely be unveiled in late February or March.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Trudeau's government pitched the fall economic statement in late 2018 as a pitch to business - the budget is expected to talk more to individual Canadians, especially the beleaguered middle class. In 2015, all everyone wanted to talk about was the middle class. Don't expect that to change in 2019.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Personality is always a big factor in elections, but it's already looking like 2019 will have an especially personal edge, particularly between the Conservatives and Liberals, but also for the untested New Democratic Party leader, Jagmeet Singh. He may get an early opportunity to practise some campaign moves in 2019 if the prime minister, as expected, calls a byelection in Burnaby South early in the new year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For a sneak preview of how personal things will get on this score in 2019, one needed only to have been watching question period on the last Wednesday before the Commons rose for the holiday break.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Wednesdays in the chamber are always raucous - the parties hold spirited caucus meetings in the morning, and the partisanship tends to spill over into Commons proceedings in the afternoon. But this final Wednesday of the 2018 sitting calendar looked a lot like a grudge match between Trudeau and Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer, who were doing all the questioning and answering for their sides that day.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Scheer used the occasion to paint Trudeau as an out-of-touch elite, who has no connection with the middle class he claims to champion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The prime minister has often boasted about inheriting a great family fortune," Scheer said. "He has never had to worry about the cost of living, so it is no wonder that he does not worry when his policies drive up the cost for Canadians. His tax on gas, on home heating and on groceries will hurt seniors, suburban moms and small businesses."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Trudeau, meanwhile, repeatedly cast Scheer as another version of past prime minister Stephen Harper, obviously in the belief that the anti-Harper sentiment that worked for the Liberals in 2015 will work in 2019, too.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I look forward to going against what seems to be the Harper Conservative platform once again," Trudeau said. "Conservatives, like Stephen Harper and Doug Ford, and the current leader are so ideologically against any environmental protection."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That reference to <span class="companylink">Ford</span> is noteworthy - it's looking like provinces will have a larger-than-usual role in Election 2019 too. Ontario Premier Doug Ford has already declared that he will be working to defeat Trudeau in the next federal election and it seems the prime minister is happy for now to cast <span class="companylink">Ford</span> as Scheer's ally.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While it's not unusual for the governments at Queen's Park and Ottawa to be ideologically opposed, this open antagonism could make things very volatile in 2019. <span class="companylink">Ford</span> is already lining up with other provincial politicians who aren't all that friendly with Trudeau's Liberals either: Saskatchewan's Scott Moe and Alberta's United Conservative Party Leader Jason Kenney (who might be premier by the time the federal election rolls around).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One feature of the last campaign will most likely make a return appearance in the next federal election - unpredictability. When that long campaign started in August of 2015, many were predicting the death of the Liberal party and the real possibility of then NDP leader Tom Mulcair as the next prime minister.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We know now how that turned out. So as Canadian politics moves into the three-act election play in 2019, it's probably wise to avoid those who claim to have spoiler alerts. Long shows can have unpredictable endings.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Re: Meth crisis has roots in socio-economic change (Dec. 19)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I would like to thank Jim Silver for his thoughtful and considered opinion piece. There is so much panic and distress being expressed about the meth situation with little, if any, thought being given to the roots of the problem.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Earlier this week there was an article blaming it on the legalization of marijuana, so I was pleased to see Silver recognizing the longer-term causes of our choices over the past 40 years. We used to be a caring country that believed in sharing what those who were better off had with those who had less. I have no idea what has happened to create this individual, competitive mindset that seems to have decided that those with the most toys and money win, creating a growing chasm between the rich and the poor.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Canada used to have a huge middle class, where most of our neighbours and friends had the same amount as did we. We then had little about which to be jealous and resentful (the roots of violence and substance abuse).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I had hoped that the election of the present government would do something to alter the trends that I have seen happening in this country for years, but not much has been accomplished in fostering the equality that would ameliorate the ugly trend toward “if I'm all right then everything is fine."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It sounds to me as if Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer is trying on U.S. President Donald Trump's language and policies (and those of other alt-right enthusiasts in many countries). I would like to think that what is happening south of the border won't happen here, but I am concerned that we seem to be following that road.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Re: Canada doesn't cut corners: minister and Afghan abuse case could test Canada (Dec. 18)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to Foreign Affairs Minister Chrystia Freeland, Canada always follows the rule of law. Really?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Then, why in 2004 did Canada participate in overthrowing the democratic government of Jean-Bertrand Aristide in Haiti, with the Americans and French? Why did Canada participate in the invasion of Iraq with the Americans, when our government said we would not? Why did Canada send troops to Afghanistan when there was no threat to us by the <span class="companylink">Taliban</span>? Why in June 2009 did Stephen Harper's minion Peter Kent not advise the democratically elected government of Manuel Zalaya, while in Honduras, there was about to be a coup, and then visit later to see the military junta murderers that took over? (For more, read Imperialist Canada by Todd Gordon, <span class="companylink">York University, Toronto</span>, pages 377-381.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">All that (and much more) aside, there are considerable questions not answered by Freeland or our prime minister. What airline was Meng Wanzhou on in flying to Canada — <span class="companylink">Air China</span>, <span class="companylink">Air Canada</span> or another? Did the aircraft fly over U.S. airspace? How would the Americans know she was aboard? Is Canada required to provide the Americans a copy of the passenger manifest if the aircraft is flying outside its airspace between China and North America? Why not simply have someone go aboard the aircraft and tell Meng that the aircraft is being turned around and she is going back to China?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Why? Because the whole episode was set up by the Canadian and American governments long beforehand. A <span class="companylink">Huawei</span> subsidiary had channelled funds through <span class="companylink">HSBC</span> to Iran, which is in contravention of U.S. sanctions against Iran. The easy target was therefore Meng Wanzhou, the CFO of Huawei, and daughter of its owner. Now we have a major mess with China, plus innocent Canadians held because of Trudeau and Freeland surrendering our sovereignty to the Americans (actually, that happened decades ago under both Liberal and Conservative governments).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Why are American sanctions against other countries our business, or responsibility? All problems with Iran can be laid at the feet of the United States and United Kingdom, whose Anglo-Iranian oil company sought to steal Iranian oil decades ago, which ultimately led to the 1953 overthrow of Iran's democratically elected president Mohammed Mosaddegh by the CIA for nationalizing Iran's oil, and the installation of a dictator, the Shah of Iran, who was ousted in 1979.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">You may also wish to read Peter McKenna's opinion piece on our abiding by the <span class="companylink">International Criminal Court</span>'s possible actions against the United States for crimes in Afghanistan, to ascertain Canada's hypocrisy in that regard and why it relates to Meng, not to mention our own military's crimes in Afghanistan and elsewhere.</p>

Time for a federal leader to lead, not dither on decisions that concern this country's well-being and economy.</p>

While the libertarians think it over, let's assume a consensus and acknowledge the progress being made in the fight against cancer. Merck is one of the leaders in developing an emerging class of drugs called immunotherapies, which enlist the body's own defences in attacking cancerous cells. Merck's wonder drug Keytruda, which has shown great promise in treating lung cancer, has also proven a key growth driver for the company, with 12-month rolling sales up by about 40 per cent over last year, as at the end of Merck's fiscal third quarter. That's more than double the growth rate of the overall immuno-oncology market in the United States, which is a big reason Merck's stock was the best performer of the Dow Jones Industrial Average this year by a wide margin. And with that, we can go back to arguing about immigration and pipelines.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">TS MRK (NYSE), up 37.5% for the year CAP REIT YEAR-TO-DATE STAR This isn't going to help ease tensions along the generational divide, but the rising pressures on tenants in Canadian cities is working to the benefit of dividend investors holding CAP REIT shares. Already, millennials blame baby boomers for failing to extend benefits they enjoyed to future generations. Pensions, for example. And home ownership.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As resale housing in some cities has become prohibitively expensive for many younger buyers, so too have rental rates skyrocketed amid heated competition for fewer vacancies. With interests in about 50,000 rental units, nearly one-third of which are in the Toronto area, CAP REIT had an overall occupancy of 99.2 per cent at the end of its fiscal third quarter, while rents are rising steadily.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This has all amounted to a 23-percent return this year for CAP REIT unitholders, who, safe to say, are much more likely to be regularly watching The National than playing Fortnite, if you know what I mean. TS CAR.UN (TSX), up 18.3% for the year</p>

Well, <span class="companylink">Microsoft</span> finally got its revenge: Propelled by growth in cloud computing, the success of XBox and the enduring popularity of Windows and Office365, <span class="companylink">Microsoft</span>'s stock surged to record highs as Apple's shares got hammered by slowing iPhone sales.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Putting an exclamation point on <span class="companylink">Microsoft</span>'s comeback under CEO Satya Nadella, the software giant in November overtook Apple as the world's most valuable company, regaining the top position it had relinquished eight years earlier.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CANADA GOOSE HOLDINGS YEAR-TO-DATE STAR With its green poop, obnoxious honking and refusal to yield to bicycles or cars, the Canada goose may not be universally adored as a species. But Canada Goose, the parka company, got no shortage of love from investors this year. The stock took flight as the company posted double-digit revenue growth, expanded its product line and hiked its fiscal 2019 outlook. The year wasn't without setbacks: The shares sank in December after the company postponed the opening of its first store in Beijing – a decision it attributed to construction delays but which came amid calls for a boycott of Canada Goose in China in retaliation for Canada's controversial arrest of Huawei's CFO. The next few months will show whether it's possible to keep this goose grounded.</p>

This is, um, progress, and it's just a sample of the things made possible by the tech giant <span class="companylink">Amazon</span>. The company that started as an online bookstore is now the global leader in e-commerce, operates the largest cloud computing platform, sells a growing assortment of private-label products and owns a movie and TV studio, among other things. <span class="companylink">Amazon</span> was also one of the S&P 500's top-performing companies in 2018, even as other tech stocks stumbled. “Alexa, get me 100 shares of AMZN for my RRSP – and find out where that pizza driver is."

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">YEAR-TO-DATE STAR Whether you're squeezing French's mustard onto your hot dog, sprinkling Club House seasoning onto your chicken or – horrors! – mixing a packet of McCormick instant gravy for the Christmas turkey, there is a McCormick shareholder somewhere saying “thank you." The company that makes these and hundreds of other spices, seasonings and condiments for consumers, food manufacturers and restaurant chains has built a global flavour empire that spans 150 countries and generates annual sales of more than US$5-billion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In addition to spicing up investors' portfolios with some delicious capital gains this year, the company hiked its dividend by nearly 10 per cent – the 33rd consecutive annual increase. Bon appétit. JH MKC (NYSE), up 35.6% for the year</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">TRIPADVISOR YEAR-TO-DATE STAR “The room was full of bed bugs, the toilet leaked and the newlyweds next door kept us up all night."

And investing in <span class="companylink">TripAdvisor</span> is a good way to get rich so you'll never have to stay in a seedy dive again. Shares of the travel website rallied as the company made it easier for users to read reviews and then seamlessly book hotels directly from the site, taking aim at competitors such as <span class="companylink">Booking.com</span> and <span class="companylink">Expedia</span>. <span class="companylink">TripAdvisor</span> also generated revenue with novel initiatives such as a deal with <span class="companylink">DoorDash</span> to enable food deliveries to hotels.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">FACEBOOK YEAR-TO-DATE DOG It all started so honourably, as a competition between former high-school acquaintances over who has the fullest, most rewarding life as evidenced by travel photos, promotion announcements and posts about the joys of parenthood. But after engaging more than one-quarter of humanity in this daily, demoralizing culture war, <span class="companylink">Facebook</span> took a dark turn. How dark? By giving outside developers access to user data, the company allowed a quiz app to harvest tens of millions of profiles, which were then used by a consulting firm working on Donald Trump's presidential campaign. While <span class="companylink">Facebook</span> has committed to fixing its security problems, a continued string of data breaches is resulting in intensifying political scrutiny and calls for boycotts. It's unclear, however, how disillusioned users who choose to leave the platform will inform the world they are feeling blessed.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SOURCE: BLOOMBERG BITCOIN YEAR-TO-DATE DOG A description of bitcoin making the rounds on <span class="companylink">Twitter</span> captures the cryptocurrency nicely: “Imagine if keeping your car idling 24/7 produced solved Sudokus you could trade for heroin." Despite mass misunderstanding of how bitcoin works, it took on an unprecedented public profile last year when its price exploded to more than US$18,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Criticisms over the high energy requirements for mining bitcoins, as well as its potential use in financing terrorism and the illegal drug trade, were mere background noise to what was seen by bitcoin faithful as the rise of a currency of the future. Its most enthusiastic supporters often share a distrust of governments and central banks, and, by extension, traditional fiat currency. That vision of bitcoin, however, is undermined by its wild volatility, which was on full display this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Down by more than 70 per cent, it's difficult to argue that bitcoin is a good store of value, even if it's heroin you're buying. TS Bitcoin, down 72.1% for the year TSX ENERGY STOCKS YEAR-TO-DATE DOG There was one hell of an early Black Friday sale in the oil patch last month – a barrel of Alberta crude could be yours for the low, low price of just US$13.46.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some things that cost more than that: the average paperback, a litre of maple syrup or a decent lunch in downtown Toronto. An extraordinary confluence of bad fortune pushed Canadian oil prices to their lowest levels on record this year. A clogged pipeline network, refinery outages, a global relapse into oversupply, concerns over demand weakness, and record Canadian production all conspired to rack the energy sector with the worst downturn since the oil-induced recession.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As a result, all but one oil and gas producer in the S&P/TSX Composite Index declined on the year, with <span class="companylink">MEG Energy Corp</span>. posting a gain mainly by virtue of a takeover bid from <span class="companylink">Husky Energy Inc</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Little for energy investors to celebrate, let alone all those kids with barrels of bitumen sitting under the tree. TS TSX Energy, down 28.9% for the year CORUS ENTERTAINMENT YEAR-TO-DATE DOG Chances are there are not a whole lot of tweens glued to Global TV on Friday nights to watch Chicago Fire or its spinoff Chicago PD on Wednesday nights, or its other spinoff Chicago Med on Saturdays. All three are offerings from <span class="companylink">Corus</span>, which is facing fierce competition for viewers, particularly younger viewers, from the likes of <span class="companylink">Netflix</span> and <span class="companylink">Amazon</span> Prime. Weighed down by a heavy debt load from its acquisition of Shaw Media , and facing declining television revenues, the company was forced to cut its dividend by nearly 80 per cent while taking a $1-billion impairment charge in part to reflect the declining value of broadcast licences. CEO Doug Murphy acknowledged the need to “adapt," much like the heroes of Chicago Fire, as per the synopsis for Season 7: “When it's go time, they put their differences aside and everything on the line for each other."

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MAXAR TECHNOLOGIES YEAR-TO-DATE DOG “That's no moon." Those were the famous words spoken by Jedi master Obi-Wan Kenobi upon beholding the Death Star, the Empire's planet-killing superlaser in the original Star Wars.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Spruce Point Capital Management expressed something similar after taking a closer look at Maxar and seeing something more sinister behind the spacetechnology company's shiny public profile. Questionable accounting was being used to cover up financial strains, Spruce Point alleged in an August report titled Falling Out of Orbit to Zero, which, incidentally, turned out to be the Death Star's ultimate fate at the hands of the plucky Rebel Alliance. And who knows, maybe old Obi-Wan had already called his broker to put a short position on the Empire. Spruce Point was certainly short Maxar's stock, which proved a prophetic bet when, in October, the company reported a US$384-million impairment charge, raising questions about the sustainability of one of the company's satellite businesses and cratering the stock by 45 per cent in one day. TS MAXR (TSX), down 81.2% for the year</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">ROOTS YEAR-TO-DATE DOG It's fitting that Roots features a beaver in its logo: The iconic retailer sure knows how to chew through investors' money.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It started the moment Roots went public in October, 2017, when the shares – which the company had initially sought to price at $14 to $16 – were issued at $12 and promptly fell to $10 on their first day of trading. The disastrous debut should have served as a warning. Hit by disappointing results – including a 13.4-per-cent drop in same-store sales in the third quarter – the shares extended their losses in 2018. The company attributed the lousy results to warm fall weather, the lack of a major marketing campaign and a hangover from 2017 when Canada's 150th birthday gave sales a boost. But investors seemed to be fearing something worse: Maybe the Roots brand just isn't cool any more.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">JH ROOT (TSX), down 72.4% for the year CINEPLEX YEAR-TO-DATE DOG One of the year's biggest box-office hits was Crazy Rich Asians. Unfortunately, there are still a lot of crazy poor Cineplex shareholders. Even as the movie theatre chain posted higher boxoffice and concession revenue per patron in the third quarter – contributing to a 4.4-per-cent increase in overall revenue – earnings were dragged down by restructuring charges, an increase in share-based compensation expenses and sharply lower revenue from in-theatre advertising.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Cineplex's CEO called the disappointing quarter “an anomaly," but judging by the hefty decline in the stock price, investors are worried that making money on this stock could be Mission: Impossible.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">JH CGX (TSX), down 36% for the year APHRIA YEAR-TO-DATE DOG A common side effect of marijuana use is paranoia. For instance, while under the influence you might imagine that Aphria came under attack from short sellers who alleged that the cannabis producer purchased assets in Jamaica, Colombia and Argentina at valuations that were “vastly inflated or outright fabrications." Further, you might imagine that those assets had been owned previously by firms with ties to an adviser and prominent investor in Aphria. Your paranoia might even lead you to believe that, even as the company dismissed the allegations as “false and defamatory," Aphria's shares collapsed and analysts slashed their price targets. Good thing it was just your paranoia and none of this, er, actually happened.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">JH APHA (TSX), down 65.1% for the year DOLLARAMA YEAR-TO-DATE DOG For years, Dollarama was an unstoppable growth stock. But as the retailer saturated the market with stores and steadily hiked prices, you knew something had to give eventually. When samestore sales rose just 2.6 per cent in the second quarter – about half of what analysts expected – the stock got crushed. It tumbled again when U.S. short-seller Spruce Point Capital took aim at the company in late October, and suffered yet another drop in December when third-quarter results also disappointed. The collapse wiped out more than two years worth of gains in Dollarama's stock price and left investors wondering if the company will ever regain its former growthstock glory. JH DOL (TSX), down 40.6% for the year</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">GENERAL ELECTRIC YEAR-TO-DATE DOG General Electric used to be a stock that let investors sleep soundly. In 2018, it was a stock that woke everyone up at night.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hammered by losses in its power business and the ill-timed 2017 acquisition of oilfield-services giant <span class="companylink">Baker Hughes</span>, the oncemighty industrial conglomerate missed earnings expectations repeatedly, fired CEO John Flannery after a little more than a year on the job, slashed its quarterly dividend to a penny and got punted from the Dow Jones Industrial Average, of which it had been a member since the Dow's founding in 1896. Nothing <span class="companylink">GE</span> did – including bringing in the respected Lawrence Culp as CEO and splitting the power business in two – could stop the relentless slide in the stock.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mark Machin, CPPIB's chief executive, said companies that have female directors are likely to achieve superior long-term financial results. “For that reason, engaging with companies to drive better corporate behaviours is a key part of CPPIB's mandate," Mr. Machin said in a statement. “We have been addressing board-effectiveness issues in our portfolio for many years and hope more institutional investors will join us in advocating for diverse boards." The move is the latest push in Canada's corporate world to encourage more female participation at senior levels as part of an overall increased focus on environment, safety and governance issues. Other financial institutions have made similar demands at corporate annual meetings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This spring, the CanadaUnited States Council for Advancement of Women Entrepreneurs & Business Leaders, founded by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and U.S. President Donald Trump, called on governments in both countries to do more to accelerate the growth of female entrepreneurship and encourage private-sector investors to provide capital to women.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In September, <span class="companylink">Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce</span> introduced a “Women in Leadership Bond" to fund companies striving to improve gender diversity in senior roles.

CIBC subsequently removed that funding restriction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CPPIB, which manages $368.3billion in assets, said it voted at annual meetings of 45 Canadian companies with male-only boards in 2017, and since then nearly half of those companies have appointed at least one female director.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">1938 – 2018</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is with great sorrow that we announce the passing of William “Bill" Andrew Dunsmoor on Tuesday, December 18, 2018 in his 80th year. Beloved husband of Susan Isabel (Thomson), married June 29, 1961 after being Earl Haig Collegiate sweethearts. Bill was very proud of his two sons and their families, Scott W.A.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dunsmoor and his wife, Derra (Davidson) and their children, Andrew and Marlene; James S.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dunsmoor “Jim," his daughter, Zoe and his family, Kimberley (Robbins) and her daughters, Chloe and Holly. Bill's passing is felt deeply in the heart of his sister, Dorothy-Mae Paterson (husband, Daniel “Danny," deceased) and their family, Stephen and wife, Carmen, Diane and Ron Dyer; their son, William, his wife, Sarah and their daughter, Claire; as well as Dale Paterson living in Ireland.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bill has missed his sister, Carolyn B. “Penny" (deceased) for many years and will now be missed by her husband, Tom Liban and his wife, Arlene; and Penny's son, Charlie. Similarly, Bill is in the hearts of his brother-in-law, James “Jim" Thomson and his wife, Cynthia “Cindy" (White), and their children, Mark, and son, Luke; and Ryan and wife, Erin and their baby, Aubrey. Predeceased by both of his parents, William S. and Isabel (Smith) Dunsmoor and his younger sister, Carolyn B.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Penny" (Liban).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bill graduated from the <span class="companylink">University of Western Ontario</span>, Faculty of Mechanical Engineering in 1963.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bill's degree served his career incredibly well. Bill and his father, Bill Sr., acquired ownership of AllWeld Company Limited in the early 1960's after the passing of the 1920 founder, William Sharp. Bill's work provided him with purpose and pride for over 65 years. He was one of the most well respected fabricating engineers in Ontario.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">His reputation for honesty, integrity, professionalism and, most of all, friendship was immediately felt by every employee, customer, supplier, and guest that came through the doors of All-Weld. His passion has always been in building - he loved fabricating. He particularly loved to share with family and friends his many contributions of public art and sculpture displayed both in Toronto and around the world. He was so proud that his sons, Scott and Jim, represent the third generation of Dunsmoor ownership.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When he was not at the office, he would be heading for the cottage on Gloucester Pool. A long history on the Thomson side brought Bill and Sue to Little Go Home Bay were they built their own place in 1969. Bill, Susan and the boys built the cottage, always a project, and almost always done with Bill's own two hands. This was a place Bill and Susan always cherished and have developed multi-generations of friendships.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">McCowans, Duffs, Sinclairs, and Allens are as close to family as Bill could ever dream of.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Donalda Club has been a second home for Bill and Sue for 51 years. The camaraderie and togetherness they enjoyed with members and staff was truly cherished.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Most of all, Bill loved his friendships with everyone.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He loved meeting people and knowing people. He cared, they mattered, it was important to him. You were all important to him. Bill loved you all.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As per Bill's wishes, a gathering of family and friends in celebration will be held at the Donalda Club on Saturday, January 12th. Details of the timing will be posted on the Humphrey Funeral Home website, www.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">humphreymilesnewbigging.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Born June 21, 1931 to Gilmore Brenton and Alice (Miller) Creelman, she grew up in Arlington and Lincoln, Massachusetts with her brothers Brenton and James.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Cynthia graduated from Concord Academy and Radcliffe College, <span class="companylink">Harvard University</span>, followed by degrees in Law and Education at <span class="companylink">Boston University</span>. In 1957, she married Richard “Dick" Hill and relocated to Toronto, Ontario where they established the Canadian branch of Tetra Pak. In 1963, the family moved to Inuvik, NWT where they became active members of the new community. In Inuvik, Cynthia became an educator, teaching in primary and secondary school and then becoming the Superintendent of Continuing and Special Education for the Western Arctic.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Retiring from public service in 1991, she moved to Calgary where she completed her law qualifications, articling and becoming a member of the Alberta Bar in 1994.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She was born in Perth, Ontario to Lawrence Lashley and Mabel Rodgers and grew up with her two brothers on a farm near Lanark, Ontario. Her Scottish and Irish ancestry helped to form her resolute and determined character.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She was predeceased by both parents and by her brother John.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dorothy's lifelong interest in teaching manifested itself in many ways - assisting in the Faculty of Education with the supervision of students engaged in practice teaching during her early years in Calgary, involvement in the formation of the Campus Pre-School Co-op at a time when pre-school education programs were rare in Calgary, pressing for the development of bilingual education in the Calgary school system and in teaching practically oriented English classes for new Canadian women. She participated in the Faculty Women's Club, served for a term as President, and introduced and maintained a Bible Study as an option in the Club's program of activities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Wherever she attended church - in Lanark, Ontario, in Ottawa or in Calgary - she was immediately involved in teaching Sunday School and with youth programs. Some students she had taught at Lisgar in Ottawa more than sixty years ago still kept in touch with her.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We will miss her beautiful smile, her laughter, the inner strength which supported all her convictions, and her unquestioning loyalty and love for us all.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">QC January 20, 1934 December 11, 2018</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After a short illness, our Dad, Big B, Da left us too soon.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Born and raised in Vancouver, Ed was the 1952 Kitsilano High valedictorian. He joined the University Naval Training Division (UNTD) in order to avoid taking PE at UBC. His first summer in Halifax, he spotted a gorgeous brunette beauty across the wardroom at the HMCS Stadacona. And so began a romance that was to last more than 50 years until Gwen's death in 2008.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ed and Gwen began their married life in a cold-water basement suite in Kits while Ed earned his law degree at UBC. He was called to the Bar in 1961, beginning a distinguished career that lasted until his retirement at the age of 83. As one of the old guard of West Coast divorce lawyers, Ed was known as a fierce litigator with great empathy, who knew when to listen and when to advise.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Above all else, Ed was a family man who adored and cherished his three children, Paul (Shelley), Katherine (Scott) and Melissa; and delighted in his grandchildren, Sean, Ashley, Sasha and Dachshund, Max.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He was never happier than when he was with his family, whether skiing at Whistler, travelling through Europe in a VW van, lounging in a hammock at Hornby Island, or enjoying good food, wine and many cigars at the family home in West Vancouver.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">His incisive wit and thirst for knowledge never left him, even at the end, when he was doing The <span class="companylink">New York Times</span> crossword in the hospital and telling the residents to “go home and do your homework." Ed's friendships were many and varied, some dating back to high school and others more recent. He cherished his friends and was especially grateful for their support after the loss of his beloved Gwen.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We would like to thank the caring staff at St. Paul's Hospital Palliative Unit who treated him with such compassion and tenderness during his final days. We are so grateful for their support.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">BARBARA ANNE OSBORNE</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">1929 - 2018</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">During the summer of 1948, Barbara Swabey was working at the Ojibway Club in Pointe au Baril. She received dozens of love letters from Donald Osborne. His persistence paid off and the following May, Babs and Donnie joined forces to create an incredible partnership that lasted more than half a century.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There was no shortage of plans and projects and Barbara somehow managed it all. Start with four rebellious kids, children of the 1960s and 70s. The first arriving when she was barely 21.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Then came Donnie's grand plan to own a toy store, the iconic “Toy Shop" in Yorkville, followed by four more around Ontario.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These required extended buying trips overseas in the spring to stock them and a frantic work schedule in the fall and winter leading up to Christmas. And just to add a little more excitement, the team opened an antique store in Collingwood.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Early on, they decided their growing family would be skiers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Not being believers in half measures, Babs and Donnie bought a 100 acre farm near beautiful Ravenna. This indeed was an ambitious plan with four young children, since the place had no running water and was serviced by an outhouse. Yet somehow the kids made it to ski school every weekend. Then came the reconstruction of two log cabins into one grand “chalet" and finally the move to the Beaver Valley and the renovation of yet another farm house that became “Fairlauchin" where they spent their retirement years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Summers were spent at the Osborne family cottage at Lake Simcoe, for Barbara under the watchful eye of her somewhat stern Scottish mother-in-law, Lorna Bruce Osborne. What a great summer for the kids, but perhaps a little stressful for the daughter-in-law. Then there was the Jackson's Point Yacht Club that was re-established by Donnie and friends in the late 1960s.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Babs signed on as crew to team Osborne and committed to racing every summer weekend. There may be nothing more stressful for a married couple than racing a dingy together on a light wind day. But Babs and Donnie's partnership flourished.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When Donnie died, Barbara moved to her charming “little yellow house" in Clarksburg. She was active in the Clarksburg/ Thornbury community and at St.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">George's Church in Clarksburg.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She embraced the great outdoors and could be found hiking and cross country skiing in her 80s.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Babs and Donnie amassed wonderful groups of friends in Toronto, at Lake Simcoe and in the Thornbury area. We remember fondly Barbara's 80th birthday party on a sunny day on the lawn of the little yellow house with so many friends in attendance.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Barbara (Babs, Babsie, but please don't call me Barb) left us on December 12, 2018. She was predeceased by her parents, Harold and Margaret Swabey and her sister Margot. She is survived by her sister Wendy (Gross); and her grateful children; Jeff (Mary Anne), Diana, Cynthia (Mark) and Mike (Pat). She was the proud and adoring “Nan" to nine grandchildren; Heather, Drew, Mike, Chris, Ashleigh, Andrew, Liz, Jess and Kate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The family will privately celebrate her life over Christmas. We gratefully thank all for the many wonderful expressions of love and the shared memories.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NELL CAROLYN RODGER (née Barbet)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">July 8, 1920 December 18, 2 018</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is with profound sadness that our family announces the passing of our incredible mom. Nell had a long, healthy life in Sault Ste.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Marie, where she was fortunate to share 59 years with our dad, Dave, and had many lifelong friends.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nell held the gift of life in given high regard and she put her “all" into everything she did. She absolutely loved music, singing and dancing. From the early years of the Artillery Balls, to Saturday evening dances at the Legion and the Algo Club, she and Dave could clear the dance floor. She water-skied till her 85th year, and she checked off a dream to skate the Rideau Canal in Ottawa from her bucket list at 87. Mom adored people, especially babies, and filled her home with guests for whom she loved to cook and was known to bake a pie or two.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Christmas was the highlight of the year, with as many as 30+ sharing dinner, caroling and washing up in the early days.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She was an accomplished seamstress - making many of her own and her children's clothes - and she perfected the art of knitting, donating baby sweaters to the <span class="companylink">Sault Area Hospital</span>'s gift shop for fund raising. Mom also loved to paint in oil and shared her creative gifts with her children, grandchildren and others who expressed interest.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Catholic Church was central to mom's life and in the early 1950's she acted as the first president of the CWL at Our Lady of Good Counsel Church. She remained active within her church to the end of her life, helping out in the office after years of taking a spot in the choir, organizing funeral lunches for members of the congregation. She was also an active volunteer for the Canadian Cancer society, the March of Dimes and at the hospital in the oncology department.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mom adored the Sault, its surroundings, and especially lived to get out to the Camp as soon as winter's departure allowed. Her legacy lives on in her large family across the country who will miss her terribly.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In lieu of flowers, donations to the <span class="companylink">Sault Area Hospital</span> Oncology department would be greatly appreciated. Friends and family are invited to attend a Celebration of Nell's life at the Machine Shop 83 Huron St., on Friday, December 27th, 5 - 7 p.m.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Funeral mass to be held at Our Lady of Good Counsel Church, 114 Macdonald Avenue, Saturday, December 28th, 11 a.m.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">JOHN SAMBROOK</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">August 31,1935 December 12, 2018</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is with deep sadness that we announce the peaceful passing of John Sambrook on December 12, 2018. Beloved husband of Mary and loving father to Bart (Susan), Caro and Patrick. He is survived by his sister, Anne Cowan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">John was born in London, England and came to Canada in 1956 to make a life for himself in Montreal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">His first job was bartending at the Royal St. Lawrence Yacht Club where he met many life-long friends and, eventually he worked for the Royal Trust in Methods and Systems and at Canadair. He had several passions which he never stopped pursuing until the last days of his life.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In his early years, he played in goal on his school soccer teams and then became an accomplished cricket player for the National Air Training Corps. Foremost in his life, however, was his love of automobiles and car racing which resulted in his recent induction into the Canadian Motorsport Hall of Fame as a driver, instructor and track designer. He also loved playing, teaching and competing in squash, both singles and doubles; in the summer he would switch rackets and play tennis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">John was a founder of the Opimian Society which he ran for 35 years during which time he traversed the country countless times educating Canadians on the joys of wines from all over the world. His love of wine would spread to publishing, guided tours to wine producing countries and his involvement in the William Hill Winery (Napa, CA), the Black Prince Winery (Picton, ON) and Winesecrets (Sebastapol, CA). John was also an avid and accomplished chef who loved to treat friends and family to creative and delicious cuisine always carefully matched with fine wines.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A memorial service is planned at 11:00 a.m. Friday, February 8, 2019 at St. George's Church, 1101 Stanley, in Montreal. In lieu of flowers, please consider a donation to the Cedars Cancer Foundation in John's memory.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 1962, he returned to Montreal as head of the magazine's first editorial office outside New York.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Under his direction, Time Canada recruited a talented young staff who greatly broadened the magazine's Canadian coverage. In 1973, John became chief of the Time-Life bureau in London.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After Time closed its Canadian editorial edition in 1976, he stayed on as Time's Ottawa bureau chief, retiring in 1984.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Quarterly survey shows 51 per cent of firms expect to add workers in the next 12 months</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's becoming a tale of two economies in Canada – declining fortunes in the energy-dependent West and relative optimism virtually every else, according to the <span class="companylink">Bank of Canada</span>'s final quarterly business outlook survey of 2018.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Overall sentiment dipped slightly from the third quarter and sales expectations have flattened, but businesses remain generally positive about their prospects for investment and hiring.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The central bank reported “positive business sentiment and elevated capacity pressures in most regions," according to the survey, released Friday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the mood is different on the Prairies – including Alberta, Saskatchewan and Manitoba – where the central bank reported a “subdued" outlook for sales and weaker capacity pressures.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Firms linked to western Canadian oil prices and to housing in some regions expect demand to weaken or remain subdued and sales growth to moderate," according to the survey, which is based on interviews conducted Nov. 5-28 with executives of 100 companies that roughly represent the Canadian economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The bank's composite indicator of sentiment dropped to 2.19 in the latest survey, down from 2.83 in the fall and 3.07 in the summer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Unfortunately, the positive mood evident in previous surveys isn't translating into higher business investment, Toronto-Dominion Bank economists Brian DePratto and Ksenia Bushmeneva said in a research note. “When the rubber hit the road, words haven't translated into action," they pointed out.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The survey suggests Canada's economy is “hanging in there" in spite of the problems in the oil patch, Bank of Montreal economist Benjamin Reitzes said. And that should allow Bank of Canada Governor Stephen Poloz to continue hiking its key interest rate in 2019.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Assuming the financial volatility didn't damage the real economy too badly and conditions stabilize, it's reasonable to look for the [<span class="companylink">Bank of Canada</span>] to resume rate hikes next year, even if at a more cautious pace," Mr. Reitzes said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The central bank has raised its key rate five times since mid-2017 – to 1.75 per cent from 0.5 per cent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Its next scheduled rate announcement is Jan. 9.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nearly half of businesses surveyed reported higher sales in the past 12 months, but they are considerably less optimistic for the year ahead, with respondents split equally on whether sales growth will pick up or slow down in the next 12 months. Companies involved in information technology and non-residential construction were most bullish about their sales prospects.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nearly half of companies – 46 per cent – plan to increase spending on machinery and equipment in the next 12 months. That is down slightly from the fall survey, but still solid, according to the bank. Twenty-one per cent of respondents said they would spend less.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even on the Prairies, investment intentions have held up due to “long-term investment strategies and spending plans to implement new technology," the bank said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Across the country, 51 per cent of companies say they expect to add workers in the next 12 months. That is roughly the same as in the fall survey. Many companies that don't plan to hire more workers said they would meet demand with “automation and digital tools."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, 56 per cent of companies reported they are facing capacity pressures.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nearly 40 per cent of respondents continue to report that labour shortages are affecting their ability to meet demand. That is roughly in line with the historical average in the survey.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On inflation, more companies than not expect to face higher prices for input costs – 33 per cent versus 26 per cent. Overall, businesses expect input prices to grow at a faster clip in the next year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Output prices are also expected to rise as companies pass on costs to their customers, including higher input costs and tariffs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Over all lending conditions were unchanged for households but easier for businesses in the quarter, according to a separate survey of senior loan officers, also released Friday by the bank. The bank said there was some tightening of prices on conventional mortgages in Ontario, B.C. and the Prairies, along with lower demand for all types of mortgages.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Requirements on workrest periods for rail workers, introduced in 2002 with only minor revisions since then, should reflect the latest science and fatigue management practices, Garneau said.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Transportation crews often work long and irregular hours, frequently in multiple time zones and challenging conditions, the <span class="companylink">Transportation Safety Board of Canada</span> said in a report last fall.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The order comes amid an ongoing ramp-up in crude oil transport by rail and follows Alberta Premier Rachel Notley's pledge to buy new oil tanker cars that could eventually move an additional 120,000 barrels a day in response to a lack of pipeline capacity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The TSB has cited sleeprelated fatigue as a factor in 31 freight train collisions or derailments since 1994, including the Lac-Megantic tragedy in July 2013 when an oil train explosion killed 47 people.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since then, the amount of crude shipped by rail has shot up more than 140 per cent to a record 327,229 barrels a day in October 2018, with particularly steep increases over the past nine months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The railways, in consultation with unions, must submit rules to <span class="companylink">Transport Canada</span> by May 19 for approval by the end of June.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Offered a choice of choosing their elected representatives by the tried-and-true method of First Past the Post, where the candidate's name, face, address and party are known to all who vote - or by various more serpentine methods that called for solving a Sudoku puzzle, reading the flight of migratory birds and writing a short essay (with equations) on quantum entanglement, all prior to voting for an anonymized candidate to be chosen later by the leader of a fringe party promising to ban indoor heating and to subsidize all urban hen farms by the imposition of a nationalized cluck tax - B.C. voters chose - and this is astonishing - FPTP, the system that fashioned the democratic <span class="companylink">government of Canada</span>, has worked for over a century and a half, is straightforward and which they understood.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Populist ingrates. There's just no telling what citizens will vote for, if you let them. Now if is this were China ... In Alberta, populism took to the 18-wheelers, in what could have been the largest convoy protest this country has even seen, a thousand and more big rigs stretched over 22 kilometres. It got about as much coverage outside Alberta as some trendy school board opting for confusing bathroom signage - one for males, one for females, and one for if you have time to change your mind on the way in.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some political figures and media vocalists are a bit down on populism, which they like to interpret as pure demagogy, a vile appeal to the very worst instincts of people. Essentially however, what they so deride in these terms is almost any result that diverges from the superior, non-populist opinions they hold. What such call populist when speaking in public, they call stupid when no microphones are in sight. Brexit would be a good example.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If B.C. had gone 100 per cent for the Byzantine contortions of Proportional Representation, it would have been "democracy at its finest and most mature." Likewise, if in some inconceivable universe, Albertans to a man and a woman voted to plug every oil well in the province, and henceforth to live under a giant dome fashioned of solar panels, there would be very many to applaud the wisdom of the common man and the beauty of Canadian democracy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An energized citizenry is called populist when it challenges status quo politicians. A citizenry becomes energized when status quo politicians have abandoned listening to basic messages from the people they represent. Take Alberta's only cabinet minister, Amarjeet Sohi, for example. In the week of the mass convoy and protests, he offered this muddle: "It's not the activists that are stopping pipelines from happening. It is the flawed process that we have now that is broken, the way governments and companies tried to make shortcuts."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That first sentence is a phoenix of rarest flight. It would be amazing if it came from the lips of a politician in Barbados or some backpacker stranded in the Galapagos Islands. But from an Albertan federal cabinet minister within driving distance of the oilsands? It's not the activists that are stopping the pipelines from happening? What in the names of every deity have the Borg hive of environmental NGOs - <span class="companylink">Greenpeace</span>, the <span class="companylink">David Suzuki Foundation</span>, <span class="companylink">the Sierra Club</span>, Environmental Defence, <span class="companylink">The Rockefeller Foundation</span>, <span class="companylink">350.org</span>, <span class="companylink">Rainforest Alliance</span>, Pembina Institute, Tides, Deep Green Resistance and the Earth Day Network - plus every Green party on the planet, to say nothing of Neil Young, Leonardo DiCaprio, Bill Nye, Al Gore and his trained Gorelings, and every sad 18-yearold vegetarian performance artist ... what have all these and the legions of their ilk been doing these past two decades? Knitting shawls for denuded yaks? They have had one concerted goal - to shut down and kill the oilsands - and stopping pipelines has been their dream of a last tactic. And they have been winning because this government in particular, with its global-warming obsession, but others before it as well, have not answered or stood up to them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And then there is Minister Sohi's second sentence, which tells us that the pipelines have been stopped because "governments and companies tried to make shortcuts." Shortcuts? Like say Keystone, which Obama "shortcutted" for eight whole years? Like TMX, which <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span> spent seven years and more than a billion dollars on before giving up in the face of activist protests, courts and government non-support? Like Energy East, which ran terrified from yet more regulations and updates? Like banning tankers in B.C. waters, which killed Northern Gateway? And what kind of "shortcut" does he see in Bill C-69, which is "populistically" being opposed by every sentient Albertan and yet which is still on the parliamentary agenda of his Green-Liberal government? His leader, Justin Trudeau, doesn't go farther out to sea only because there is no ocean wide enough on which to try that experiment. But when Mr. Trudeau talks of politicians "exploiting" Western sentiment on this issue, a not-so-oblique rebuke of the "populist" mood in the West right now, the tactic is so obvious as to be insulting. There is no need to "stir up" or "exploit" the political mood on the energy file. The collapse of oil prices, the imposition of the absurd so-called carbon tax in the middle of an oil-price depression in Alberta, and pandering to B.C. and Quebec while running past Alberta and Manitoba, offers more than enough explanation for that mood.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The populism, if that is indeed the term, out West is not demagogy. It is the inevitable upsurge of citizen emotion when fairness is blatantly abandoned, common sense is outraged by political leaders, and when representatives of the people are so far out of touch that ordinary workers have to organize massive truck rallies just to catch their attention.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Legault recently provoked the ire of western Canadians when he said there was "no social acceptability" in his province for a "dirty energy" pipeline from Alberta.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Higgs, a former oil executive, is proposing that federal transfer payments be cut to force provinces to develop their natural resources.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He said that as a result of devalued oil, Alberta is losing $80 million a day, and all the provinces - including New Brunswick - should share in the pain through cuts in transfers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We should cut what goes to each province, based on our ability to get the resource to market," he said.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"So with Alberta, Manitoba, Saskatchewan, Ontario and ourselves - we are very much aligned - and Quebec in the middle in this case for transportation from west to east is not only disappointing, it's really shocking," he said.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Higgs said there should be a utility corridor across the country that could house pipelines, power transmission lines, and communication systems.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Higgs said another area where the federation is fractured is with the way provinces are being treated differently by Ottawa when it comes to the carbon tax, which goes into effect next year. He said it is far from a level playing field, because the provinces are being asked to meet the same targets despite starting from different carbon-emission levels.</p>

For investors, 2018 was the year it all went down – stocks, bonds, commodities – very little was spared the carnage. The year was essentially book-ended by broad market corrections, between which there was a meltdown in the Canadian energy market and a sell-off in big-name U.S. tech stocks, leaving the bull market looking more vulnerable than it has in recent memory. As a tumultuous year draws to a close, here is a final look at the stars and dogs of 2018.</p>

But after engaging more than one-quarter of humanity in this daily, demoralizing culture war, <span class="companylink">Facebook</span> took a dark turn. How dark? By giving outside developers access to user data, the company allowed a quiz app to harvest tens of millions of profiles, which were then used by a consulting firm working on Donald Trump’s presidential campaign. While <span class="companylink">Facebook</span> has committed to fixing its security problems, a continued string of data breaches is resulting in intensifying political scrutiny and calls for boycotts. It’s unclear, however, how disillusioned users who choose to leave the platform will inform the world they are feeling blessed. -Tim Shufelt</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bitcoin Futures (DOG)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A description of bitcoin making the rounds on <span class="companylink">Twitter</span> captures the cryptocurrency nicely: “Imagine if keeping your car idling 24/7 produced solved Sudokus you could trade for heroin.” Despite mass misunderstanding of how bitcoin works, it took on an unprecedented public profile last year when its price exploded to more than US$18,000. Criticisms over the high energy requirements for mining bitcoins, as well as its potential use in financing terrorism and the illegal drug trade, were mere background noise to what was seen by bitcoin faithful as the rise of a currency of the future. Its most enthusiastic supporters often share a distrust of governments and central banks, and, by extension, traditional fiat currency. That vision of bitcoin, however, is undermined by its wild volatility, which was on full display this year. Down by more than 70 per cent, it’s difficult to argue that bitcoin is a good store of value, even if it’s heroin you’re buying. -Tim Shufelt</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">TSX Energy Stocks (DOG)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There was one hell of an early Black Friday sale in the oil patch last month – a barrel of Alberta crude could be yours for the low, low price of just US$13.46. Some things that cost more than that: the average paperback, a litre of maple syrup or a decent lunch in downtown Toronto. An extraordinary confluence of bad fortune pushed Canadian oil prices to their lowest levels on record this year. A clogged pipeline network, refinery outages, a global relapse into oversupply, concerns over demand weakness, and record Canadian production all conspired to rack the energy sector with the worst downturn since the oil-induced recession. As a result, all but one oil and gas producer in the S&P/TSX Composite Index declined on the year, with <span class="companylink">MEG Energy Corp</span>. posting a gain mainly by virtue of a takeover bid from <span class="companylink">Husky Energy Inc</span>. Little for energy investors to celebrate, let alone all those kids with barrels of bitumen sitting under the tree. -Tim Shufelt</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Chances are there are not a whole lot of tweens glued to Global TV on Friday nights to watch Chicago Fire or its spinoff Chicago PD on Wednesday nights, or its other spinoff Chicago Med on Saturdays. All three are offerings from <span class="companylink">Corus</span>, which is facing fierce competition for viewers, particularly younger viewers, from the likes of <span class="companylink">Netflix</span> and <span class="companylink">Amazon</span> Prime. Weighed down by a heavy debt load from its acquisition of Shaw Media, and facing declining television advertising revenues, the company was forced to cut its dividend by nearly 80 per cent while taking a $1-billion impairment charge in part to reflect the declining value of broadcast licences. CEO Doug Murphy acknowledged the need to “adapt,” much like the heroes of Chicago Fire, as per the synopsis for Season 7: “When it’s go time, they put their differences aside and everything on the line for each other.” -Tim Shufelt</p>

<span class="companylink">Maxar Technologies</span> (DOG)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“That’s no moon.” Those were the famous words spoken by Jedi master Obi-Wan Kenobi upon beholding the Death Star, the Empire’s planet-killing super-laser in the original Star Wars. Spruce Point Capital Management expressed something similar after taking a closer look at Maxar and seeing something more sinister behind the space-technology company’s shiny public profile. Questionable accounting was being used to cover up financial strains, Spruce Point alleged in an August report titled Falling Out of Orbit to Zero, which, incidentally, turned out to be the Death Star’s ultimate fate at the hands of the plucky Rebel Alliance. And who knows, maybe old Obi-Wan had already called his broker to put a short position on the Empire. Spruce Point was certainly short Maxar’s stock, which proved a prophetic bet when, in October, the company reported a US$384-million impairment charge, raising questions about the sustainability of one of the company’s satellite businesses and cratering the stock by 45 per cent in one day. -Tim Shufelt</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Roots (DOG)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It’s fitting that Roots features a beaver in its logo: The iconic retailer sure knows how to chew through investors’ money. It started the moment Roots went public in October, 2017, when the shares – which the company had initially sought to price at $14 to $16 – were issued at $12 and promptly fell to $10 on their first day of trading. The disastrous debut should have served as a warning. Hit by disappointing results – including a 13.4-per-cent drop in same-store sales in the third quarter – the shares extended their losses in 2018. The company attributed the lousy results to warm fall weather, the lack of a major marketing campaign and a hangover from 2017 when Canada’s 150th birthday gave sales a boost. But investors seemed to be fearing something worse: Maybe the Roots brand just isn’t cool any more. -John Heinzl</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Cineplex (DOG)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One of the year’s biggest box-office hits was Crazy Rich Asians. Unfortunately, there are still a lot of crazy poor Cineplex shareholders. Even as the movie theatre chain posted higher box-office and concession revenue per patron in the third quarter – contributing to a 4.4-per-cent increase in overall revenue – earnings were dragged down by restructuring charges, an increase in share-based compensation expenses and sharply lower revenue from in-theatre advertising. Cineplex’s CEO called the disappointing quarter “an anomaly," but judging by the hefty decline in the stock price, investors are worried that making money on this stock could be Mission: Impossible. -John Heinzl</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Aphria (DOG)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A common side effect of marijuana use is paranoia. For instance, while under the influence you might imagine that Aphria came under attack from short sellers who alleged that the cannabis producer purchased assets in Jamaica, Colombia and Argentina at valuations that were “vastly inflated or outright fabrications.” Further, you might imagine that those assets had been owned previously by firms with ties to an adviser and prominent investor in Aphria. Your paranoia might even lead you to believe that, even as the company dismissed the allegations as “false and defamatory,” Aphria’s shares collapsed and analysts slashed their price targets. Good thing it was just your paranoia and none of this, er, actually happened. -John Heinzl</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dollarama (DOG)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For years, Dollarama was an unstoppable growth stock. But as the retailer saturated the market with stores and steadily hiked prices, you knew something had to give eventually. When same-store sales rose just 2.6 per cent in the second quarter – about half of what analysts expected – the stock got crushed. It tumbled again when U.S. short-seller Spruce Point Capital took aim at the company in late October, and suffered yet another drop in December when third-quarter results also disappointed. The collapse wiped out more than two years worth of gains in Dollarama’s stock price and left investors wondering if the company will ever regain its former growth-stock glory. -John Heinzl</p>

<span class="companylink">General Electric</span> used to be a stock that let investors sleep soundly. In 2018, it was a stock that woke everyone up at night. Hammered by losses in its power business and the ill-timed 2017 acquisition of oilfield-services giant <span class="companylink">Baker Hughes</span>, the once-mighty industrial conglomerate missed earnings expectations repeatedly, fired CEO John Flannery after a little more than a year on the job, slashed its quarterly dividend to a penny and got punted from the Dow Jones Industrial Average, of which it had been a member since the Dow’s founding in 1896. Nothing <span class="companylink">GE</span> did – including bringing in the respected Lawrence Culp as CEO and splitting the power business in two – could stop the relentless slide in the stock. -John Heinzl</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">You can’t hide from the taxman. Unless, of course, you’re a large corporation, then it’s hiding season, all year round. In September, a <span class="companylink">Tax Court of Canada</span> decision in favour of <span class="companylink">Cameco</span> gave fodder to the common complaint that the <span class="companylink">Canada Revenue Agency</span> is failing to thwart corporate-tax avoidance. <span class="companylink">Cameco</span>, one of the world’s largest uranium producers, had been battling the CRA over the claim that the company underpaid taxes by $2.5-billion by shifting profits to a Swiss subsidiary with only two employees. For years, <span class="companylink">Cameco</span> had been weighed down by low uranium prices amid a global oversupply that emerged after the 2011 tsunami caused Japan to shutter its nuclear reactors. The tax fight was an additional overhang. As a result, <span class="companylink">Cameco</span>’s court victory produced the stock’s single best day in nearly 10 years. In other words, the same old song (with apologies to The Beatles): “Let me tell you how it will be / There’s one for you, nineteen for me / Unless you move it all offshore / Then you get to keep it all / 'Cause I’m the taxman …” -Tim Shufelt</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Great Canadian Gaming (STAR)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Great Canadian Gaming essentially had two very good days this year. In early May, the company reported earnings that trounced analyst expectations, largely as a result of its new stake in three Toronto-area casinos, including the Woodbine and Great Blue Heron casinos. The share price soared by 27 per cent in one day, with the next three days taking the total gain to 41 per cent. In November, the company’s Greater Toronto Area properties helped it post another huge beat, as third-quarter revenues and earnings roughly doubled. That time, the stock leaped by another 22 per cent. And that’s pretty much it. The rest of the year was unimpressive. But as any poker player knows, if you can take a couple of monster pots, you just might be able to coast through the rest of the game. -Tim Shufelt</p>

<span class="companylink">Twitter</span> (STAR)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As a top-performing stock, <span class="companylink">Twitter</span> is as deeply flawed as it is a social-media platform. On Tuesday, <span class="companylink">Amnesty International</span> published the results of a study suggesting <span class="companylink">Twitter</span> content is teeming with racist and sexist abuse, making it a “toxic place for women.” That came as a bombshell revelation to, well, almost no one who has been on <span class="companylink">Twitter</span>. But then short-seller Andrew Left predicted the study will be impossible for Wall Street to ignore, calling <span class="companylink">Twitter</span> the “Harvey Weinstein of social media.” And yet, in a twist of dark irony, or perhaps as a knock against capitalism, <span class="companylink">Twitter</span>’s stock has still posted one of its best years since going public in 2013, having outperformed <span class="companylink">Facebook</span> by nearly 50 percentage points. Amid an attempt to purge the site of fake accounts and bots, advertiser revenue has been growing alongside active daily users. In June, <span class="companylink">Twitter</span> was added to the venerable S&P 500 Index, forcing index funds managing trillions of dollars to invest in the stock Mr. Left now calls “uninvestible.” -Tim Shufelt</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Merck (STAR)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It seems as though there is nothing that cannot be divided among partisan lines these days, but can we at least agree that cancer is bad? While the libertarians think it over, let’s assume a consensus and acknowledge the progress being made in the fight against cancer. Merck is one of the leaders in developing an emerging class of drugs called immunotherapies, which enlist the body’s own defences in attacking cancerous cells. Merck’s wonder drug Keytruda, which has shown great promise in treating lung cancer, has also proven a key growth driver for the company, with 12-month rolling sales up by about 40 per cent over last year, as at the end of Merck’s fiscal third quarter. That’s more than double the growth rate of the overall immuno-oncology market in the United States, which is a big reason Merck’s stock was the best performer of the Dow Jones Industrial Average this year by a wide margin. And with that, we can go back to arguing about immigration and pipelines. -Tim Shufelt</p>

<span class="companylink">Canadian Apartment Properties REIT</span> (STAR)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This isn’t going to help ease tensions along the generational divide, but the rising pressures on tenants in Canadian cities is working to the benefit of dividend investors holding CAP REIT shares. Already, millennials blame baby boomers for failing to extend benefits they enjoyed to future generations. Pensions, for example. And home ownership. As resale housing in some cities has become prohibitively expensive for many younger buyers, so too have rental rates skyrocketed amid heated competition for fewer vacancies. With interests in about 50,000 rental units, nearly one-third of which in the Toronto area, CAP REIT had an overall occupancy of 99.2 per cent at the end of its fiscal third quarter, while rents are rising steadily. This has all amounted to a 23-per-cent return this year for CAP REIT unitholders, who, safe to say, are much more likely to be regularly watching The National than playing Fortnite, if you know what I mean. -Tim Shufelt</p>

Well, <span class="companylink">Microsoft</span> finally got its revenge: Propelled by growth in cloud computing, the success of XBox and the enduring popularity of Windows and Office365, <span class="companylink">Microsoft</span>’s stock surged to record highs as Apple’s shares got hammered by slowing iPhone sales. Putting an exclamation point on <span class="companylink">Microsoft</span>’s comeback under CEO Satya Nadella, the software giant in November overtook Apple as the world’s most valuable company, regaining the top position it had relinquished eight years earlier. Momentum is on <span class="companylink">Microsoft</span>’s side: Since Mr. Nadella took the reins in 2014, <span class="companylink">Microsoft</span>’s shares have nearly tripled and the company has hiked its dividend five times. -John Heinzl</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With its green poop, obnoxious honking and refusal to yield to bicycles or cars, the Canada goose may not be universally adored as a species. But Canada Goose, the parka company, got no shortage of love from investors this year. The stock took flight as the company posted double-digit revenue growth, expanded its product line and hiked its fiscal 2019 outlook. The year wasn’t without setbacks: The shares sank in December after the company postponed the opening of its first store in Beijing – a decision it attributed to construction delays but which came amid calls for a boycott of Canada Goose in China in retaliation for Canada’s controversial arrest of Huawei’s CFO. The next few months will show whether it’s possible to keep this goose grounded. -John Heinzl</p>
