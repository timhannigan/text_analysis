Naloxone kits are free for most in six provinces or territories but that's not the case in others, indicating the patchwork of services across Canada. Canada's big city mayors and other experts have called for a national plan to stop the dying but so far there's no umbrella approach from the federal government. By Amy Smart.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Coal is dead."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These are not the words of a <span class="companylink">Greenpeace</span> activist or left-wing politician, but of Jim Barry, the global head of the infrastructure investment group at Blackrock — the world's largest asset manager. Barry made this statement in 2017, but the writing has been on the wall for longer than that.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Banks know it, which is why they are increasingly unwilling to underwrite new coal mines and power plants. Unions and coal workers know it, which is why they are demanding a just transition and new employment opportunities in the clean economy. Even large diversified mining companies are getting out of the business of coal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The only ones who seem to have remained in denial are President Donald Trump and non-diversified mining companies like <span class="companylink">Westmoreland Coal</span>. The Denver-based firm made a bad bet in 2013 when it purchased five coal mines in Alberta. Now it wants Canadian taxpayers to pay for its mistake.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Alberta's coal phaseout</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Three years ago, Alberta's New Democratic Party (NDP) committed to what some have described as "the most ambitious climate plan in North America to date." In addition to the development of an economy-wide carbon price, the province is phasing out coal-fired power by 2030. Without the infrastructure to export coal, the climate plan has also resulted in a de facto phaseout of local thermal coal mining.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To ensure support for the plan, major utility companies in the province were provided with "transition payments" to facilitate the switch to gas and renewable energy. Westmoreland did not receive a government handout, because coal mining companies have no role to play in the energy transition. The company, which filed for bankruptcy protection for its investments in the United States in October, doesn't think this is fair.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">NAFTA</span>'s investment chapter</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Because Westmoreland is an American company, it can rely on the <span class="companylink">North American Free Trade Agreement</span> (<span class="companylink">NAFTA</span>) for protection from "unfair" treatment. <span class="companylink">NAFTA</span> allows a foreign investor to use a process known as "Investor-State Dispute Settlement" (ISDS) when government action harms its business in some way.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">ISDS allows foreign investors to bypass local courts and bring claims for monetary compensation to an international tribunal. The system is not unique to <span class="companylink">NAFTA</span>; it is found in other trade agreements like the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans Pacific Partnership (CPTPP) and thousands of bilateral investment treaties (known as Foreign Investment Promotion and Protection Agreements in Canada).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">ISDS is hugely controversial. Concerns have been raised by a wide range of actors about both the process of ISDS, and the way the system can infringe on the sovereign right of states to regulate to protect public health, human rights and the environment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More than 900 ISDS cases have been launched by investors since the early 1990s, including 27 against Canada that have so far cost Canadian taxpayers at least $315 million. There is one ongoing dispute that concerns a ban on gas fracking in Québec, but the Westmoreland claim is the first brought in relation to a policy explicitly designed to combat climate change.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Westmoreland argues that part of the reason it invested in Canada in 2013 was to diversify its holdings in response to regulatory risk. At the time, the Obama Administration was taking action under the Clean Power Plan to reduce the reliance of American utilities on coal. The company's failure to anticipate similar regulatory action by its northern neighbour is remarkable.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A key battleground</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If governments respond appropriately to the urgent warning issued by the <span class="companylink">Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) </span>in October, efforts to phase out fossil fuels will have to ramp up considerably — and quickly. We should expect the industry to fight these efforts through a variety of means. ISDS may become a key battleground.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA or CUSMA, depending on who is talking about it), which may replace <span class="companylink">NAFTA</span> (it has been signed, but has not been ratified), does not retain the process of ISDS between Canada and the U.S.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While this is good news in the long run, some have suggested that there will be a "rush of filings" before access to ISDS for already established investors expires (three years after USMCA comes into force). Canada will also be exposed to claims from investors under other agreements such as the CPTPP and Canada-European Union Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement (CETA).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other countries, particularly poorer nations, face an even higher risk of ISDS claims and have far less resources available to fight them. It is notable that big oil companies have retained some access to ISDS against Mexico in USMCA, after lobbying hard for it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A climate of fear?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If Westmoreland's case proceeds to arbitration, it will not have direct implications for Alberta's climate policy. An investment tribunal cannot require the provincial government to reverse the coal phaseout; it can only award the company damages. Westmoreland is asking for US$470 million. It is the federal government, rather than Alberta, that would have to pay compensation to Westmoreland if the company's claim was successful. However, Ontario did agree to pay the award in a recent <span class="companylink">NAFTA</span> case.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What is more concerning than any potential payout is that Westmoreland's suit could hinder efforts to implement similar plans to combat climate change in other jurisdictions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Regulatory chill" is a phenomenon that has been observed in several jurisdictions around the world. A notable example is the decision of the New Zealand government to delay the introduction of legislation to require plain packaging of tobacco products until Australia won its ISDS case against the tobacco company <span class="companylink">Philip Morris International</span>. This delay of regulatory action — out of fear of expensive litigation — may have cost lives.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As recent forest fires and floods have demonstrated, delays in action to combat climate change can also be deadly.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">OTTAWA — Cooling inflation has given the <span class="companylink">Bank of Canada</span> another reason to keep interest rates on ice next month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The annual pace of inflation slowed in November to 1.7 per cent as upward pressure from higher gasoline prices eased off, <span class="companylink">Statistics Canada</span> said in a report Wednesday.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The agency's latest data point showed the weakest year-over-year pace of inflation since January 2018 in a reading far more sluggish than October's level of 2.4 per cent. Inflation for September was 2.2 per cent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Canada's core inflation readings, which strip out volatile items like gasoline, also had a little less pep last month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many experts said the inflation results Wednesday reinforced predictions the <span class="companylink">Bank of Canada</span> will be in no rush to raise its benchmark interest rate target at its next policy announcement on Jan. 9.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In fact, there are expectations the central bank could wait several months before its next move due to the combination of several recent economic developments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"With some of the volatility we've seen in the financial markets and the lower oil prices' impact on economic activity in Western Canada, the <span class="companylink">Bank of Canada</span> can afford to be cautious and will be in no rush to their next rate hike," said James Marple, senior economist for TD Bank.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">Bank of Canada</span>, which can raise its trend-setting rate as a way to keep inflation from climbing too high, has introduced five hikes since the summer of 2017 in response to the stronger economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Marple said the central bank's next increase might come in March — and that may only be if crude prices move back up, market volatility abates and trade fears surrounding the U.S.-China relationship start to subside.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We only think they'll go twice this year," he said, referring to potential 2019 <span class="companylink">Bank of Canada</span> rate hikes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">Statistics Canada</span> said the recent drop in global oil prices translated into a 5.4 per cent price contraction at the gas pump in November, handing the gasoline category its first year-over-year decrease since June 2017.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Excluding gas, the inflation rate would have increased 1.9 per cent last month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Leading up to the report, analysts had projected inflation to slow thanks to weeks of cheaper prices at the pump. Economists had expected a increase of 1.8 per cent, according to Thomson Reuters Eikon.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Bad news for Alberta has been good news for Canadian consumers, as cheaper gasoline has brought inflation down to earth," CIBC chief economist Avery Shenfeld wrote in a note to clients.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prices softened in other areas as well. The cost of durable goods recoiled 0.1 per cent last month, following a 0.9 per cent expansion in October, as consumers paid less for furniture, tools and other household equipment compared with a year earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Downward pressure on prices last month also came from lower year-over-year costs for traveller accommodation, digital computing equipment and devices and telephone services.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The main upward forces driving inflation were higher costs for fresh vegetables, airline tickets and mortgage interest.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The average of the agency's three core inflation readings slowed slightly to 1.9 per cent last month, from two per cent in October.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">All three core measures sat at 1.9 per cent — below the ideal two per cent target of the <span class="companylink">Bank of Canada</span>. The core average has stayed close to the two per cent bull's-eye in recent months and November's reading is the first time it slowed to 1.9 per cent since June.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">Bank of Canada</span> pays close attention to core inflation ahead of its rate decisions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As governor Stephen Poloz weighs his next decision, experts expect him to remain focused on the recent plunge oil prices, the capacity of the energy sector to engage in business investment and the ability of Canadian households — many of which are saddled with very high levels of debt — to manage higher interest rates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The bank must also consider another concern — a sharp deceleration in wage growth over the past six months. The national unemployment rate has been near a 40-year low for more than a year, but wage growth has cooled instead of picking up its pace in the tightened labour market.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CALGARY, Alberta, Dec. 19, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- <span class="companylink">International Frontier Resources Corporation</span> (“IFR” or the “Company”) (TSX-V: IFR) (OTCQB: IFRTF) is pleased to announce that Tonalli Energia (“Tonalli”), IFR’s joint venture (JV) with Mexican petrochemical leader Grupo IDESA, has reached total depth at its first conventional horizontal well, (“TEC-11”), on its onshore Tecolutla block.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">TEC-11</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The TEC-11 field development horizontal well has been drilled to a depth of 3283 meters (m) Measured Depth (MD). The well was landed horizontally in the Cretaceous aged El Abra formation limestone. A total of approximately 670m of measured length of Cretaceous limestone was drilled before the total depth was reached. Oil shows were encountered during drilling.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A 4.5-inch production liner has been set and cemented to 2865m MD. Based on Logging While Drilling (“LWD”) Gamma Ray and Sonic log tools and drill cuttings descriptions, the cased portion of the TEC-11 well Is interpreted to be in an interval similar to what was produced in the offset TEC- 2 well.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tonalli is currently planning a perforation, stimulation and flow-testing program for TEC-11. This program is expected to commence in the New Year following which Tonalli will provide a comprehensive update on the results of the production test.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">TEC -10</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tonalli has now received its first payment from <span class="companylink">PEMEX</span> for oil shipped from its Tecolutla field. Tonalli’s TEC-10 producing well averaged 156 barrels of oil per day in October and November at an approximate average crude sales price of USD$64.73 per barrel. Initial operating costs averaged USD$17.39 per barrel with an expectation that these costs will continue to be reduced as production moves from rented equipment to permanent facilities, improved water handling and operational efficiencies. Operating netbacks for the two months averaged USD$20.12 per barrel.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Tecolutla field is located within the Tampico-Misantla basin, which has multiple reservoirs with diverse play types and access to existing infrastructure, market, service sector providers and an established supply chain. In 2017, <span class="companylink">IHS Markit</span> identified the Tampico-Misantla Basin as a potential “Super Basin”.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Through its JV with <span class="companylink">Grupo Idesa</span>, IFR was one of the first foreign companies to participate in Mexico’s historic reform of the oil and gas sector. The Tecolutla block was awarded to Tonalli as part of the first round and third call of Mexico’s oil and natural gas “mature fields” bid round (“Round 1.3”).</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This press release contains forward-looking statements and forward-looking information (collectively "forward-looking information") within the meaning of applicable securities laws relating to the Company's plans, strategy, business model, focus, objectives and other aspects of IFR's anticipated future operations and financial, operating and drilling and development plans and results, including, expected future production, production mix, reserves, drilling inventory, net debt, cash flow, operating netbacks, decline rate and decline profile, product mix, capital expenditure program, capital efficiencies, commodity prices, tax pools and targeted growth. In addition, and without limiting the generality of the foregoing, this press release contains forward-looking information regarding: anticipated cost savings and operational efficiencies; anticipated capital cost estimations; the focus and allocation of IFR's 2017 capital budget; anticipated production rates, available free cash flow, management's view of the characteristics and quality of the opportunities available to the Company; and other matters ancillary or incidental to the foregoing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Forward-looking information typically uses words such as "anticipate", "believe", "project", "target", "guidance", "expect", "goal", "plan”, "intend" or similar words suggesting future outcomes, statements that actions, events or conditions "may", "would", "could" or "will" be taken or occur in the future. The forward-looking information is based on certain key expectations and assumptions made by IFR's management, including expectations concerning prevailing commodity prices, exchange rates, interest rates, applicable royalty rates and tax laws; capital efficiencies; decline rates; future production rates and estimates of operating costs; performance of existing and future wells; reserve and resource volumes; anticipated timing and results of capital expenditures; the success obtained in drilling new wells; the sufficiency of budgeted capital expenditures in carrying out planned activities; the timing, location and extent of future drilling operations; the state of the economy and the exploration and production business; results of operations; performance; business prospects and opportunities; the availability and cost of financing, labour and services; the impact of increasing competition; ability to market oil and natural gas successfully and IFR's ability to access capital.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Statements relating to "reserves" are also deemed to be forward looking statements, as they involve the implied assessment, based on certain estimates and assumptions, that the reserves described exist in the quantities predicted or estimated and that the reserves can be profitably produced in the future.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although the Company believes that the expectations and assumptions on which such forward-looking information is based are reasonable, undue reliance should not be placed on the forward-looking information because IFR can give no assurance that they will prove to be correct. Since forward-looking information addresses future events and conditions, by its very nature they involve inherent risks and uncertainties.

Management has included the above summary of assumptions and risks related to forward-looking information provided in this press release in order to provide security holders with a more complete perspective on IFR’s future operations and such information may not be appropriate for other purposes.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Good morning. With official Ottawa winding down for the holidays, we thought we’d take this week to reflect back on the stories that shaped the year in politics. We asked some of the reporters in The Globe’s Ottawa bureau what stories they covered that had the biggest impact.  Gloria Galloway [https://www.theglobeandmail.com/authors/gloria-galloway/] , who writes about many issues that affect Indigenous communities, chose a story that didn’t get much attention: drinking water.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The federal government is making headway in its efforts to ensure that all First Nations in Canada have access to clean drinking water.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The lack of potable water on many reserves has been one of those seemingly insurmountable challenges, and human-rights issues, that governments of both stripes have tried to tackle – with few results.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Engineering experts were skeptical when Prime Minister Justin Trudeau promised, during the 2015 election campaign, to end all of the long-term drinking water advisories on public systems on reserves within five years of a Liberal government taking office.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There were 105 advisories in effect at that time. Some, like the one in the Neskantaga First Nation in Northern Ontario, stretched back two decades.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In January, 2018, the Indigenous Services department added 250 First Nations water systems to the list of those it will repair and maintain. And, in doing so, it added 24 more long-term boil-water advisories to the total.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But, by mid-December of this year, the total number of advisories had been reduced to 64, and federal officials predicted that a few more would be cleared before the calendar rolls over to 2019.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That has been done with an investment of close to $2-billion, not all of which has been spent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We’re very happy with the progress in that we have been able to keep on track with our targets and our plan,” Jane Philpott, the Minister of Indigenous Services, said in an interview. “Though clearly,” she added, “there is a long way to go yet.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Perry Bellegarde, the National Chief of the <span class="companylink">Assembly of First Nations</span>, counts the progress being made in providing clean drinking water to First Nations communities as a success story.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The federal government predicts that most of the long-term advisories will end by 2020, and is on track to meet the 2021 promise. Ms. Philpott said there is a plan in place for each of the communities that remain on the list.</p>

Katie Ragan (Montreal Gazette)[https://montrealgazette.com/opinion/opinion-quebecers-and-albertans-should-set-aside-provincialism] on the two solitudes: “Quebec’s contempt and Alberta’s anger are understandable. But for projects in the country’s overall economic and social interest, Canadian provinces need to stop thinking so provincially. For Quebec, that means being open to pipelines that meet safety and environmental standards for the sake of benefits to all Canadians ­ like the ability to build more schools, hospitals, roads, and hydro-electricity infrastructure. For Alberta, that means recognizing that equalization payments are at the core of the Canadian Confederation, which continues to aspire to leave no member of the federation behind.”</p>

Saudi Arabia’s primary arms supplier is the United States; trailing way behind is the United Kingdom and France. According to the Stockholm International Peace and Research Institute’s arms transfer database, the military capability value of Canadian arms transfers – or its actual contribution to Saudi fighting capability – is practically insignificant.

So why does this matter? A 2016 Supreme Court limit that placed time limits on criminal trials means cases risk getting thrown out if they’re not completed in a speedy manner. “The one thing slowing us down is the lab,” said Crown attorney Rick Woodburn. “Forensic testing will take time, that’s understandable. But the numbers we’re seeing are terribly lengthy. It’s dramatically affecting our justice system.” Woodburn says more staff are needed and that the RCMP should consider reopening labs it shuttered during a round of cost-cutting.</p>

When children become adolescents, they have new experiences that can sometimes present new risks. … Let’s start by losing our complacency and pledging to never permit, mask or make excuses for any type of abuse. Let’s call hazing and initiation what it truly is: a deliberate, often illegal use of power to abuse and degrade another human being.” –  Peter MacKay [https://www.theglobeandmail.com/opinion/article-what-we-can-learn-from-st-mikes-to-keep-our-kids-safe/] (board chair) and Karyn Kennedy (CEO) of the Boost Child & Youth Advocacy Center</p>

Robert Ripley’s first cartoon appears</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dec. 19, 1918: Long before anyone saw Mother Teresa’s face in a cinnamon bun, American Robert Ripley discovered a craving among the public for the weird and wonderful. Working at The New York Globe in the early 1920s as a sports cartoonist, Ripley’s first cartoon was a single-panel piece entitled Champs and Chumps that featured remarkable feats of athleticism. Later that year, the panel morphed into a wider look at oddities from the human and natural worlds, with Ripley asking the public to believe it – or not. Travelling to more than 200 countries, he collected offbeat facts and artifacts, which he displayed in his “Odditoriums.” (He seemed to have a particular penchant for farmyard mutations and items collected during his tours of the Far East.) Much of the material for the cartoon was sourced by the unheralded Norbert Pearlroth, his researcher for more than 50 years, who was fluent in 14 languages and spent most days at the New York Public Library scouring foreign publications. In 1929, Believe it or Not! was syndicated worldwide, making Ripley a household name and a millionaire. Today, <span class="companylink">Ripley Entertainment Inc</span>. is owned by Vancouver’s <span class="companylink">Jim Pattison Group</span> and boasts more than 100 attractions worldwide. – Ian Morfitt</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists still expect that the <span class="companylink">U.S. Federal Reserve</span> will raise its key interest rate this week. But they will be on the lookout for any suggestion that the central bank will slow the pace of hikes next year, given recent uneven economic signals, the volatile stock market and the fact that U.S. President Donald Trump is imploring the Fed to hold off.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We think that members will end up voting for a rate hike,” economists at National Bank Financial said in a note. “That said, the tone of the statement should be noticeably more dovish; we suspect that the reference to ‘further gradual increases’ will be removed.”</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Fed has been raising its key rate since December 2015. Inflationary pressures, such as wage increases, have been picking up after years of ultra-low rates in the wake of the financial crisis. The U.S. economic expansion has produced strong employment growth and a near-50 year low unemployment rate of 3.7 per cent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Fed last raised its rate in September, in keeping with a quarterly pace. A quarter of a percentage point hike on Wednesday will take the federal funds rate target to a range between 2.25 per cent and 2.5 per cent, marking the eighth hike in three years and the fourth this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the path forward is no longer clear, which is why Wednesday’s decision by the Fed is one of the most anticipated monetary policy decisions in recent years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The stock market has turned tumultuous this year, reflecting concerns about corporate profitability in 2019. And a number of economists believe that economic activity is set to slow, as the stimulus from recent U.S. tax cuts wears off and companies feel the effects of trade tariffs and steeper borrowing costs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The S&P 500 is down 4.4 per cent this year, putting the index on track to post its worst annual performance since 2008, when stocks were falling during the financial crisis. Commodities are also weak: Crude oil fell 7.4 per cent on Tuesday, touching its lowest level in 16 months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While retail sales remain strong, new home sales have fallen and declining homebuilding stocks are reflecting deep pessimism in a sector that is particularly sensitive to shifting economic winds. What’s more, many observers believe that the flat yield curve – or relatively little difference between the yields on two-year and 10-year government bonds – is consistent with an economic slowdown.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“At a minimum, the flat shape is signalling a stall-speed economy next year,” David Rosenberg, chief economist and strategist at Gluskin Sheff + Associates, said in a note.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists polled by Reuters last week say there is a 40 per cent chance of a recession within the next two years, up from 35 per cent in a prior poll.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Already, the economies of Germany and Japan have contracted, and confusion over Brexit has created uncertainties about the U.K. economy. In China, retail sales in November slowed to a 15-year low, and car sales slumped 14 per cent from last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Canada, low oil prices are weighing on Alberta’s economy, potentially sidelining the <span class="companylink">Bank of Canada</span>’s own rate hikes. The bank held its key rate unchanged at 1.75 per cent earlier this month, and an anticipated rate hike in January is now an open question.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The world economy is still expanding at a rapid pace, but cracks are starting to appear in the global growth picture,” Brian Coulton, chief economist at <span class="companylink">Fitch Ratings</span>, said in a note.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even the pickup in U.S. inflation, which has underscored the pace in rate hikes, may be ebbing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The recent volatility in financial markets will not stop the Fed raising rates at its meeting. A bigger concern for the Fed is the renewed weakness in core inflation, which may prompt some officials to revise their interest rate projections lower,” Michael Pearce, senior U.S. economist at Capital Economics, said in a note.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Consumer prices in November were unchanged from the previous month, due partly to tumbling energy costs. The annual inflation rate subsided to 2.2 per cent, or its lowest level in 11 months. The core rate, which ignores volatile energy costs, rose slightly – also to 2.2 per cent – but perhaps not enough to bolster the case for aggressive rate hikes ahead.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The Fed's final rate decision of 2018 is next Wednesday, and a quarter point rate hike is largely a done deal. However, looking ahead to next year, we expect only two more rate hikes will be required to keep inflation on target,” Leslie Preston, senior economist at Toronto-Dominion Bank, said in a note.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some economists see the need for even fewer rate hikes in the year ahead, drawing even more attention to a monetary policy statement that is going to rivet observers worldwide.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The Fed is still likely to pull the trigger on a rate hike in December after respectable data on employment, factory ISM and core retail sales. But we no longer see as big an overshoot risk for 2019," Avery Shenfeld, chief economist at CIBC World Markets, said in a note.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He added: "If, as we expect, growth isn’t much better than 2 per cent, the Fed will be limited to one final hike next year, one that it could end up reversing in 2020 as fiscal policy tightens.”</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">OTTAWA -- Federal Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer believes he will be prime minister by this time next year, after defeating Liberal Prime Minister Justin Trudeau to lead his party to a majority government.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If he only holds Trudeau to a minority government, Scheer believes Conservatives will be happy for him to stick around as leader and try again in 2023, if not sooner.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And if he loses the 2019 federal election outright?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Scheer insists he hasn't thought about that prospect. At all.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a wide-ranging conversation with the Star at a holiday reception he hosted at Stornoway, the official residence of the Opposition leader, Scheer did allow that one factor he'd weigh if he does lose is the toll of public life on his family.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 39-year-old father of five will have been in office for 15 years by then, with all of his kids born since he became MP for Regina-Qu'Appelle in 2004.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So he has thought about it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet Scheer insists he's not planning to lose. Not to Trudeau, nor to Jagmeet Singh, the embattled NDP leader.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Scheer openly wishes Singh was doing better, and frequently encourages New Democrats to focus their political fire on the Trudeau Liberals - their common enemy - rather than take shots at his party.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Left-wing vote splits are important in ridings where strong Conservative candidates can come up the middle to win.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the reception where he invited journalists to mingle with his shadow ministers (as he calls them), senior staff and Conservative commentators, Scheer also said he won't lose ground to Maxime Bernier, the high-profile party defector and rival for Conservative voters.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bernier went out in August with a bang, declaring the Scheer-led Conservatives were driven solely by polls and "too intellectually and morally corrupt to be reformed."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bernier created his own political vehicle: the People's Party of Canada.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Max is not going to win one seat, including his own," Scheer predicted.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Scheer won the support of social conservatives and dairy farmers during the leadership race in which he beat Bernier, and now he's nominated a popular local mayor and a former president of an association of Quebec municipalities to run against Bernier in 2019 in his home riding of Beauce.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The only irritant, Scheer says, is Bernier could pull away some bedrock libertarian conservative support in western ridings where the traditional Conservative vote might splinter, but "there's nothing I can do about that."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And if Scheer is worried after a couple of internal critics were granted anonymity to subtly undermine him recently in the National Post, the Conservative leader does not show it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, the politician who should be the centre of attention in a room is not a person around whom a crowd naturally gathers, even at a party in his own house.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to the most recent poll from <span class="companylink">Nanos Research</span>, Scheer lags Trudeau by about 10 percentage points as the preferred choice for prime minister. Charisma is not his strong point. Scheer himself jokes about his dad jokes, his dad body and his dimpled smile.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On the upside, the NDP leader is in a much worse place, with Singh trailing Green Leader Elizabeth May, both languishing in the single digits, and Bernier barely registering, at 2 per cent. A full 25 per cent of Canadians were unsure of whom they preferred.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bob Plamondon, an author who has written extensively about Canadian conservative politics, says "if you look at the polls, most people haven't formed an impression of Andrew Scheer one way or the other."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Plamondon, who wrote a chronicle of successful Conservative party leaders in his book Blue Thunder, says Scheer ought to take note of the lessons of history: there is not a great track record of party leaders losing an election and coming back to fight another one, unless the results are really close or another election seems around the corner.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although Scheer says he is looking forward to a holiday break with his wife, Jill, and the kids in Regina, where they still keep a home near her parents' place, he says he's ready for the 10 months of hard campaigning that lie ahead.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Scheer says he's happy to have a "strong" parliamentary team to take the lead on files, and he's in no rush to roll out platform details this far ahead of the election.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Scheer has been travelling more in the past few months, sharing meetings with party supporters via <span class="companylink">Instagram</span>. He is also seeking out stakeholders who he doesn't count as supporters including, he points out, the Toronto Star, and the country's largest private sector <span class="companylink">union, Unifor</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Conservative leader is pondering how to address concerns of media organizations that he says are worried about the CBC's government-subsidized news website sucking commercial ad revenue away, and about the flow of Canadian advertising revenue to <span class="companylink">Google</span> and <span class="companylink">Facebook</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Scheer flatly opposes what he calls Trudeau's private sector "media bailout," a package of taxation and other changes that he says "potentially" could corrupt professional political journalists into providing more favourable coverage to the Liberals than he believes they already do.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Instead, Scheer is looking for possible solutions to the media revenue dilemma in Europe, where copyright agreements are aimed at ensuring a greater sharing of revenue between content creators and those who aggregate or simply repost original reporting.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Scheer asked to meet with Unifor president Jerry Dias, who represents many media workers and journalists. Some Conservatives were angered when Unifor Canada tweeted a photo of its national executive board that Dias says was a "parody" of Scheer's pose with Conservative premiers and Alberta party leader Jason Kenney on the cover of Macleans magazine, dubbed the "Resistance."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Unifor tweeted a similar pose of its leaders, saying they were planning for the federal election: "Welcome to Andrew Scheer's worst nightmare."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Neither Scheer nor Dias will discuss what they said in private, but Dias said it was a "respectful" conversation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"In retrospect," said Dias, his own retweet should not have contained the hashtag "#stopscheerstupidity."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It frankly wasn't fair, and it was disrespectful when I didn't need to be. I should have said "#scheernonsense," because the position they were taking was sheer nonsense," the union leader said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While Dias says he won't be voting for Scheer, neither he nor the Conservative leader are going anywhere, and need to deal with each other in a "respectful" way.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In fact, Dias said, they agree on the need to advance construction of oil pipelines, on the need to keep GM's Oshawa plant open and to ensure U.S. steel and aluminum tariffs against Canada are lifted.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Dias believes the Conservative Party lost a lot of support among unionized workers after the Stephen Harper government legislated restrictions on organized labour.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I'm not going to win 'big labour,' " said Scheer, but he is convinced he can win back what Conservative party strategists have often called the "bread-and-butter" labour vote.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He'll certainly need that, and more besides.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Scheer told The Globe and Mail he believes Canada could far more effectively signal its disapproval of Riyadh's murder of a dissident Saudi journalist and its ruinous war in Yemen by blocking all imports of crude oil from the kingdom.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“That would send a stronger message and actually have an impact on the Saudi regime," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“To me, the real dirty oil is from Saudi Arabia. It is from countries that don't recognize human rights, don't treat women and girls in the same way, that don't support democratic principles and the rule of law."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prime Minister Justin Trudeau told CTV's Question Period on Sunday the government was considering ways to permanently stop all shipments of the light-armoured vehicles (LAVs) to Riyadh to protest the brutal murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi and Saudi Arabia's role in the conflict in neighbouring Yemen.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Trudeau's comment came days after the <span class="companylink">U.S. Senate</span> officially blamed the Khashoggi murder on Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, the kingdom's de facto ruler, and voted last week to withdraw military aid for the Saudi-led war in Yemen.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Scheer said scrapping the armouredvehicle deal would exert no influence over the conduct of the Saudi regime, one of the world's biggest buyers of military hardware. “Cancelling the sale would have an impact on Canadian workers," Mr. Scheer said in an interview. “To me, that is not the optimal way to send a message to Saudi Arabia."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Saudi deal was brokered by the former Conservative government. The Tories, when in power, celebrated the sale as a coup, calling it the largest advanced manufacturing export deal Canada had signed. It has been valued at as much as $15-billion over 14 years, directly supports about 1,850 jobs in London, Ont., and thousands more indirectly.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">General Dynamics Land Systems Canada</span>, the Canadian arm of a U.S. defence contractor that is assembling the combat vehicles in London for Saudi Arabia, went on a public-relations offensive this week, releasing a statement warning that cancelling the deal would incur billions of dollars of penalties for the <span class="companylink">Canadian government</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Saudi-Canada relations were already severely strained before Mr. Khashoggi, a fierce critic of the Saudi Crown Prince, was killed on Oct. 2, because Canada had publicly urged Riyadh in July to immediately release jailed civil-rights activists.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In August, the Saudis expelled the Canadian ambassador, froze new trade and investment dealings with Canada in retaliation for what it called “blatant interference" in its domestic affairs. It suspended Saudi Arabian Airline flights to and from Toronto and began to withdraw thousands of Saudi students from universities, colleges and other schools in Canada as part of what Saudi Arabia's Education Minister described as an effort to “cut its dealings with the <span class="companylink">Canadian government</span>."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Scheer said that, if he wins next year's federal election, he would revive efforts to build the Energy East pipeline to carry oil from Alberta and Saskatchewan to the Irving oil refinery in New Brunswick and for export to foreign markets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Conservative Leader is not the only Canadian voice calling for replacing Saudi imports with more Canadian oil. So far this year, Canada has imported nearly 115,000 barrels of oil a day from Saudi Arabia into New Brunswick – or about 5.7 per cent of the Canadian oil supply.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Former Liberal MP Martha Hall Findlay, now president and chief executive of the Canada West Foundation, says that the commercial and political relationship between Canada and Saudi Arabia is not just about armoured vehicles. Canada pays the Saudis a significant amount for this oil.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We send on average about $4.3-billion each year to Saudi Arabia," Ms. Hall Findlay said. “That is more than three times greater than the annualized value of the armoured-vehicles contract."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New Brunswick Premier Blaine Higgs, along with some other premiers, is also pushing the proposed pipeline even though Quebec remains opposed and original proponent <span class="companylink">TransCanada Corp</span>. says the $15.7-billion project is defunct.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">However, Mr. Scheer said he is convinced the project can be viable and is willing to campaign on the issue even in Quebec, where the Energy East proposal is unpopular.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The mid-sized producer said it plans to spend about $450 million next year, about the same as this year, to take average production to about 71,000 barrels per day, about 3.4 per cent less than its current production of 73,500 bpd.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"By shifting growth capital from the first half of the year into the second half, it reduces our average production for the year but allows us to repay $74 million of debt by the end of the second quarter and gives us maximum flexibility for organic growth in the second half of the year."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The company usually spends more than half of its budget in the first six months of the year, when frozen ground allows better access to backcountry drilling sites in Western Canada.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2018, it spent 55 per cent in the first half of the year and production peaked in March; next year it plans to spend only 30 per cent in the first half, then ramp up spending in the summer to allow production to peak in November.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Uncertainty over prices has forced intermediate companies like Whitecap, <span class="companylink">Baytex Energy Corp</span>. and <span class="companylink">Obsidian Energy Ltd</span>. to be conservative as they rolled out their budgets this week, said analyst Thomas Matthews of <span class="companylink">AltaCorp Capital</span>.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last week, I was in England to attend an Oxford conference on the noble but almost hopeless notion of international tax co-ordination. Far more exciting was discussing with colleagues and following the media coverage about the U.K. Conservatives'confidence vote testing the leadership of Prime Minister Theresa May over Brexit.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">May managed to hang on but, at best, her agreement with the <span class="companylink">EU</span> for an orderly Brexit is on life support. Of 317 Tory MPs, 117 backbenchers voted to oust May. They were especially dissatisfied with the "Irish backstop." That proposal, which May negotiated with the <span class="companylink">EU</span>, would require all of the United Kingdom to remain bound to the <span class="companylink">EU</span> customs union for years after March 29th's Brexit deadline. That would last until the U.K. and <span class="companylink">EU</span> can agree on a plan to avoid installing a hard customs border between the independent Republic of Ireland, which is staying in the <span class="companylink">EU</span>, and Northern Ireland which, as part of Britain, is Brexiting. Hard borders have a bad history in that part of the world.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But while remaining in or leaving the <span class="companylink">EU</span> raises important political and economic issues for Britain over tax, immigration, trade policies and more, the decision is not an existential threat to Britain's independence, which will endure no matter what international agreements the government makes or breaks. Such is not the case in Alberta, where interest in separation - you might call it an Albexit - is growing quickly.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The possibility of leaving Alberta oil wealth in the ground, while world demand - already at 100 million barrels per day - keeps growing at a robust 1.5 per cent each year, is an existential threat to the province. Despite endless promises from so many self-appointed prophets of a renewable future, demand for oil continues to rise since it is needed for petrochemicals (such as all those plastics in all our tech gadgets) as well as air, sea, rail and short-and long-haul road transport. Even with rising production of electric vehicles, all the credible energy agencies project that demand for oil in 2050 will be as high as or higher than demand today.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet, Alberta is looking at being forced to sit it out, thanks to political decisions being made by Canadians outside the province. Because of the lack of pipeline capacity promoted by environmentalists who push for Canada to be a "climate leader," and the politicians who play along, Albertans are losing high-paying jobs, wealth, government revenues and foreign investment in the oil patch. The lack of support from other provinces - especially British Columbia and Quebec - is raising questions about Alberta's place in Confederation. Quebec's premier, François Legault, recently called Alberta's oil "dirty energy" and said he doesn't want it piped through his province, even as Quebec imports substantial volumes of that supposedly undesirable Alberta oil through Enbridge Line 9. Albertans can't help but wonder why they should stand for being slapped in the face after the federal government, Quebec and the rest of Canada have been happy to take the hundreds of billions of dollars that Albertans and their "dirty" oil have provided them over the decades.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Growing interest in an Albexit is a major problem for the federal government as its ambivalent policies are helping to stoke interest in separation. While Ottawa appears determined to salvage the so-far moribund Trans Mountain pipeline expansion, the Trudeau government's decision to ban tankers in northern B.C. killed the previously approved Northern Gateway pipeline and has thwarted other proposals, such as the Indigenous-owned Eagle Spirit pipeline. Bill C-69, which proposes to drastically change the approval process for resource projects, is bitterly opposed in Alberta for fear the new process will make it nearly impossible to build pipelines in the future. New carbon policies, including the proposed federal fuel mandate, will further inflate costs for the resource business in Canada. The Trudeau government's announcement Tuesday that it would provide $1.6 billion in non-forgivable loans for cash-constrained small firms, clean growth projects and market diversification initiatives, don't even touch the root of the problem: removing federal obstacles to building pipelines and bringing back greenfield investment to Alberta's beleaguered oil and gas sector.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's typical to pooh-pooh the possibility of Alberta separation as unrealistic, given the close familial and economic relationships Albertans have with other parts of Canada. But if Brexit happened, then Albexit is just as possible. Probably more so, given the existential threat to Alberta's prosperity over resource development.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Whatever negatives Alberta would face are easily swamped by the positives that would come with separation. Alberta can choose its own environmentally responsible oil and gas development policies without federal interference, which typically reflects the interests of Central Canada and not the West. Alberta can choose how it wishes to tax itself and organize its health and pension system. It could develop its own trading relationship with the United States and the rest of Canada as it see fits. If Saskatchewan wished to join Alberta in separation, it would bring to fruition a proposal made before 1905 that would have led to a single, more powerful province (called Buffalo), but was kiboshed by then Liberal prime minister Wilfrid Laurier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Alberta will also be able to keep for itself the annual $20 billion more it sends each year to Ottawa in taxes than it gets back in federal spending (that $20 billion is roughly six per cent of the province's GDP). Hard borders and potential trade barriers with the rest of Canada would be a cost, but these would be subject to negotiation - and would they really be drastically worse than current internal barriers to trade (including pipeline obstacles) that already exist between provinces? The national debt assumed by Alberta would be contentious, since Alberta would seek a credit for the $220 billion in net transfers its made to the rest of Canada over the past decade.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What is quite certain is that the potentially explosive situation in the West over resource development will be a major question in the next federal election. And what comes of it could prove pivotal. If Alberta feels it has no influence on its destiny, support for separation will surely grow. The British shocked the world by opting for the freedom of Brexit based on reasons that weren't nearly as existential. An Albexit could be the next big shock.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Quebec premier's recent statements about Alberta oil, which he referred to as "dirty energy," have understandably raised the ire of Western Canadians. Many Albertans might think that Quebecers want nothing to do with Western oil, or any oil for that matter. Nothing could be further from the truth. Let's start with the obvious: A little more than half of the oil that is consumed in Quebec comes from Canada, largely Western Canada, and this proportion has been steadily increasing since 2014.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Are Quebecers OK with that? In fact, a large majority of Quebecers, 66 per cent, prefer to get oil from Western Canada, versus seven per cent who want it from the United States, three per cent from Algeria, and one per cent each for the countries of the Middle East and Nigeria, according to a recent Leger poll conducted on behalf of the MEI.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We also learned in the same poll that 53 per cent of respondents would rather that Quebec develop its own oil resources than continue to import the oil it consumes. Quebecers also think oil should be shipped by pipeline. Indeed, they know that there is less risk involved in pipeline transport than in the other common modes of transportation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Obviously, Quebecers'opinions are very different from what is often heard from certain interest groups and from a portion of the political elite. Moreover, when Quebecers are polled on these matters year after year, the results remain pretty similar.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Not only are they open to hydrocarbon development in Canada but we learned a few days ago, in a report published by the Chair in Energy Sector Management at HEC Montréal, that Quebecers are among the biggest consumers of energy in the world.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Indeed, between 1990 and 2017, sales of SUVs and light trucks increased by 246 per cent in Quebec, and sales of gasoline jumped by 33 per cent. This trend has continued, as each year since 2015, these types of vehicles are the champs in terms of sales. In other words, Quebecers continue to consume a lot of oil.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nevertheless, because Quebec benefits from having access to hydro power for electricity, it remains the province with the lowest emissions per capita in the country. Even with all the additional gas guzzling in recent years, Quebec reduced its emissions by 11 per cent between 1990 and 2016.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Obviously, there is a considerable gap between the typical political discourse and the behaviour of the people. This is undoubtedly because Quebecers are pragmatic and more interested in paying the bills at the end of the month than in the prophesied end of the world. But ecological activists are well organized and have the support of many well-known celebrities. Their voices are dominant in the public space. Politicians, who understand the unpopularity of carbon taxes, are left with gestures that don't affect most people in their everyday lives, such as prohibiting hydraulic fracturing (fracking) or opposing pipelines and "dirty" oil, to build up their ecological cred.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Quebecers are certainly aware of the importance of problems related to the climate, but they also understand that we need oil; that this need will not disappear overnight; that we should enrich ourselves by developing our own oil; that short of producing it here, we should purchase it from our fellow citizens out West and transport it using the safest and most economical means, namely pipelines.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We need to stop conflating oil production with oil consumption. We can very well want to reduce our consumption of oil and reduce GHGs, without denying ourselves the economic prosperity that accompanies the development of our resources and that enriches us all. The two are not mutually exclusive.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Instead of demonizing Western Canadian oil, Quebec politicians should adopt behaviours that are more in line with the desires of the people, and stop interfering with the production and transport of Canadian oil.</p>

Brad Wall claims he is "done with politics."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I'm interested in politics but I'm just not going to run for anything," the former Saskatchewan premier said, as he focuses on his new job as special adviser for law firm Oslers in Calgary.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But there is a Hotel California effect to the political game - you can check out but you never really leave.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hence Wall's involvement with something called the "Buffalo Project," a nascent initiative that includes what one source called "serious financial backers," aimed at offering an unapologetic voice for western Canadian interests.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The name itself is provocative.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Buffalo was the name of the prairie "super-province" combining modern-day Alberta and Saskatchewan that Frederick Haultain, the first premier of the Northwest Territories, hoped to create in 1905. The Liberal prime minister at the time, Sir Wilfrid Laurier, decided against creating what would have been a large, conservative Western counterweight to central Canada, and instead designated them two separate provinces.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Buffalo appears to be the equivalent of a U.S.-style political action committee, an organization that pools contributions and donates the funds to specific campaigns. Wall denies it is a vehicle for his ambitions. He has no formal standing with the group, he said, though he has helped them by speaking at a fundraising dinner. But he is involved because he is as incensed as many other westerners about the impact of federal legislation on the energy and agricultural sectors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There are some things the federal government could do - first, hoist C-69 (the environmental assessment bill) and the tanker ban that applies only to one coast," he said. "The government uses the defence that nationalizing the (Trans Mountain) pipeline underscores their support for the energy sector. But they moved the goalposts on Energy East, killing that, and withdrew from Northern Gateway. The 'I feel your pain'thing is getting old. I don't think you do feel our pain."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Derek Robinson, a spokesman for the Buffalo Project, said its advisory committee is still figuring out where it is going as an organization. But he said it is not promoting Western separatism. Buffalo will "stand up for the West, but within a united Canada," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What is not yet clear is who constitutes the group's actual membership. Repeated questions about who sits on the advisory committee were met with hesitancy from Robinson.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There is a reluctance," he admitted, when asked if business leaders were uneasy about making their involvement public.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He said the Buffalo Project will disclose the appropriate information, in accordance with federal and provincial regulations, in due course. But he revealed that Dallas Howe, the former chair of Potash Corp.; Brad Gustafson, a Calgarybased portfolio manager; Grant Fagerheim, a veteran oilpatch executive; Stan Grad, a rancher, oil executive and philanthropist; and Bill Turnbull, a Calgary businessman and former <span class="companylink">CFL</span> defensive back, are all involved with the organizing committee.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Western Canadians are beyond frustration and we are simply another group that has decided it's time to take action," said Howe.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Robinson said the project was inspired by senior business people becoming exasperated with the direction of the country and deciding to build a fund to fight in favour of pipelines and modern agriculture, and against a carbon tax.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"At the moment, they're trying to figure out how to have an influence," said Robinson.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But he said Buffalo will likely support existing organizations such as Canada Action, which organized a pro-pipeline rally in Calgary on Monday; Suits and Boots, a pro-natural-resourcesector body founded by former Conservative leadership candidate Rick Peterson; and Alberta Proud, a western answer to the Ontario Proud conservative advocacy group that claimed an influential role in Ontario's last election.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Robinson pointed out that while left-leaning groups like Leadnow have been around for years - some funded by foreign organizations such as the Tides Foundation - digital-media third parties are in their infancy on the right of the political spectrum.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He said he has no idea how much money has been raised so far but pointed out there are new limits on what third parties can spend in and out of the campaign period. (The new federal election law passed last week limits third parties to spending $500,000 in the writ period and not more than $1 million in the months before the official campaign. It also bans foreign donations.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ottawa is hoping that a preelection giveaway in the shape of a $1.6-billion federal financial support package for the oilpatch, unveiled by ministers Amarjeet Sohi and Jim Carr in Edmonton on Tuesday, will cool the anger that is bubbling in Alberta and Saskatchewan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It remains to be seen whether it has the desired effect of calming tempers. Westerners see themselves on the receiving end of a sustained assault by Ottawa on their interests at the same time as more politically favoured parts of the country are benefiting.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The news that Quebec will receive increased equalization payments came at the same time as Justin Trudeau effectively vetoed the revival of the Energy East pipeline project. "There is no support for a pipeline through Quebec," he told <span class="companylink">CTV</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As Calgary Herald columnist Don Braid noted, talk of Alberta separatism is out in the open again, after a lull of 40 years. Trudeau appears to have provoked an almost identical response in the West as the rage that greeted his father's National Energy Program in the 1980s.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Celebrity investor W. Brett Wilson told Braid that he feels Alberta is being pushed out of Confederation. "I'm not a separatist, I'm a frustrated nationalist," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Turnbull, a member of the Buffalo Project organizing committee, reiterated that it is not pushing for a separate "super-province."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's not about breaking the country up, but fixing the problems and keeping the country together," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But it is a volatile situation, and it seems it wouldn't take much more provocation to persuade people it is time for the prairie provinces to head for the exit.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One of the problems with writers choosing the harshest, most catastrophic-sounding language when discussing climate change is that those word choices can contribute to a sense of defeatism, of giving up, among readers.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Thomas Walkom's recent column is an example of over-the-top rhetoric that serves nobody, least of all the young people who will have to face the consequences of climate change decades from now. Invoking “worldwide nuclear war” as his metaphor for describing the threat of climate change, Walkom predictably calls for a shutdown of the oilsands. While predictable, the suggestion is ludicrous.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He must be aware that global oil demand is growing and all of Canada is responsible for just 1.5 per cent of the world's greenhouse gas emissions, while the oilsands is responsible for just 0.16 percent. Of the world's top 10 oil-exporting countries, Canada is without a doubt the most transparent, monitored, socially responsible, democratic and environmentally progressive producer. We are also the only nation with carbon-pricing initiatives and a track record of leadership on clean technology and renewables.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That's not to mention that in 2012, the Canadian oilsands contributed $91 billion to the Canadian economy, and generated $28 billion in taxes and royalties that paid for the prized social programs Canadians expect.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For many Canadians, including within the borders of Toronto, the resource industry helps sustain dreams, provide for families and make ends meet. Even the Prime Minister has acknowledged that we could shut down the oilsands tomorrow and it wouldn't make a difference to the world – unless India and China followed suit.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Songwriter John Prine floors one Lightfoot, impresses another</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last week at an exclusive house concert recorded for George Stroumboulopoulos’s show on CBC Music, a fan of the songwriter John Prine passed out during the performance. We can call it faint praise for Prine, but not the damning kind. In fact, quite the opposite, Brad Wheeler writes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prine, 72, performed eight songs at Mr. Stroumboulopoulos’s downtown Toronto home, where 100 or so fans and well-known musicians squeezed into a living room and kitchen for a midday serenading taped for a Dec. 16 broadcast. Jim Cuddy was there as a VIP guest, but the Blue Rodeo star was only the third-best songwriter in the room, because Gordon Lightfoot was in attendance as well.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As was Hamilton folk-rocker Terra Lightfoot (no relation to the Sundown icon). Suffering from a cold, she had knocked back some over-the-counter medication to suppress the symptoms. Apparently the remedy was past its expiry date. Soon after swallowing a dose, she felt “a little weird.” Later, as Prine sang his 1971 song Sam Stone, she sank like a rock in the sea, hitting the floor, briefly unconscious.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Because the collapse happened behind Mr. Prine, the revered American songster hadn’t realized anything was amiss. Later, though, after being informed of the incident, he took Ms. Lightfoot’s brief wooziness as a compliment. “I heard we made a girl faint,” he good-naturedly told Mr. Stroumboulopoulos. “We haven’t done that in 30 years.” Subscribers, read more here.[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/arts/music/article-songwriter-john-prine-floors-one-lightfoot-impresses-another/]

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As her dementia was progressing about two years before her death, Hélène Tremblay Lavoie lost her ability to speak English, Wency Leung writes[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/life/health-and-fitness/article-long-term-and-dementia-care-urgently-needed-in-mother-tongue-for/] . The Toronto resident had been fluently bilingual, but when only her native French remained, her daughter Sylvie Lavoie struggled to find her long-term care.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For eight months near the end of her mother’s life, Lavoie would drive the roughly four-hour round trip from her home in Toronto to Welland, Ont., to visit her at the nearest available facility where staff could communicate with her in French.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Almost a decade later, the need for French services for aging francophone adults in the Toronto area is greater than ever, says Ms. Lavoie, founder and chief executive of the Hélène Tremblay Lavoie Foundation, created to address this gap in care.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Providing services in a common language is far from a frill, policy experts and advocates such as Ms. Lavoie argue. It’s critical for patients’ health, safety and quality of life – especially since many with dementia revert to their first language when their mental abilities decline.</p>

Warren Buffett’s comments at this year’s <span class="companylink">Berkshire Hathaway</span> annual meeting, recounted in a must-read November article in Fortune magazine[http://fortune.com/longform/value-investing-warren-buffett-tech-stocks/?utm_source=twitter.com&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=social-share-article] , might constitute a watershed moment by changing the definition of what it means to be a valuation-conscious investor.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In discussing his largest investment, <span class="companylink">Apple Inc</span>., Mr. Buffett said, “The four largest companies today by market value do not need any net tangible assets… They are not like <span class="companylink">AT&T</span>, GM, or <span class="companylink">Exxon Mobil</span>, requiring lots of capital to produce earnings. We have become an asset-light economy.” Mr. Buffett later admitted that not buying <span class="companylink">Google</span> was a major investing mistake.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The article goes on to note that Mr. Buffett is no stranger to adapting investing methodology. He was initially an acolyte of the Benjamin Graham value investing style – don’t pay more for a stock than the value of its equipment could receive at liquidation. Mr. Buffett later evolved in the 1960s to a focus on companies with strong brand names (brands like <span class="companylink">Coca-Cola</span> were made more powerful by the explosion in television advertising) and steady growth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Corporate and market success in recent years has been driven by intellectual property, not expanding manufacturing capacity to sell more goods. Biotechnology stocks are arguably the best example of this, developing drug treatments that can be replicated at very little cost but still sold at high prices while patent protection limits competition.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Software companies are similar – developers spend thousands of hours designing products that can be copied for free and sold.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Generating successful products is difficult for biotechnology and software companies, but the costs of making the resulting physical goods is non-existent relative to old economy industrials like <span class="companylink">General Motors</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The end result is that profit margins for intellectual property-based companies are extremely high. The average gross margin for companies in the S&P Biotech index, for instance, is 83 per cent. For the S&P Automobiles index, it’s 14.4 per cent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These high profit margins lead to expensive valuation levels in terms of price to earnings and other metrics. Up until now, value investors have largely ignored new economy stocks because of valuation but Mr. Buffett’s foray into Apple provides a signal that the tide is changing, along with the whole idea of value investing.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ahead of U.S. rate decision, Trump has set up Fed for failure</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Donald Trump may be no scholar of economics, but he is a genius at spotting a good scapegoat. On Monday, the U.S. President tweeted  his outrage at the thought of the Federal Reserve raising interest rates at its meeting this week[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/investing/markets/inside-the-market/article-when-it-comes-to-the-federal-reserve-and-potential-rate-hikes-trump/] . “It is incredible that with a very strong dollar and virtually no inflation, the outside world blowing up around us, Paris is burning and China way down, the Fed is even considering yet another interest rate hike,” he wrote. “Take the Victory!” Mr. Trump’s unsolicited advice is the last thing Fed chairman Jerome Powell needs at this point. He is already facing an army of worriers as he attempts to fine-tune interest rates against a backdrop of tumbling stocks and a slowing global economy. Now, he is in an even tougher position: If he decides to refrain from raising rates on Wednesday, he will be seen as caving in to political pressure – exactly the opposite of what the Fed was designed to do. However, if he goes ahead and bumps rates marginally higher, as the market expects, he will be blamed by Mr. Trump and his base for anything bad that follows.

It’s widely expected that the Fed will hike rates for the ninth time since 2015, moving the target rate closer to neutral territory. What the Fed decides to do this week isn’t the key, instead I’ll be paying close attention to the words spoken by Fed chair Jerome Powell, as the timing of future rate increases will be vitally important to the outlook for the U.S. economy as well as global stock markets[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/investing/markets/inside-the-market/article-inflation-fears-are-overblown-the-fed-should-pause-in-2019/] .

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Recent market ‘jolt’ will be first of many as easy money era ends, says BIS</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Recent sharp selloffs across global financial markets are probably the first of many, as investors adjust to a world of tighter monetary conditions and the threat of economic downturn, the Bank of International Settlements said on Sunday[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/investing/investment-ideas/article-recent-market-jolt-will-be-first-of-many-as-easy-money-era-ends/] . The year has been a tough one, with big drops in European and Asian stocks and even U.S. equities recently slipping into the red for 2018 after a decade-long bull-run. The last quarter saw increasing fears for world and U.S. economic growth as trade war noise escalated and central banks tightened policy or prepared to withdraw extraordinary crisis-era stimulus. The “market tensions we saw during this quarter were not an isolated event,” Claudio Borio, head of the monetary and economic department at the BIS said.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ask Globe Investor</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Question: I’ve read not to buy mutual funds before year-end to avoid paying tax on capital gain distributions. Does the same caution apply to buying real estate investment trusts (REITs) in December?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Answer: No. The problem with mutual funds is that many make only one capital gains distribution per year, in December. That amount can sometimes be significant and the tax implications costly.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For example, suppose you buy 100 units of a fund for $10 each in early December. The company then announces a capital gains distribution of $2 per unit two weeks later. You receive the distribution, but the net asset value (NAV) of your unit drops by the same amount to $8. You still have $1,000 in assets, but now it is divided between $200 cash and $800 in fund units. And the $200 distribution is taxable if received in a non-registered plan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">REITs make payments monthly, so the cash flow is spread out evenly over a full year. This is a very different scenario from mutual funds, so the same caution does not apply.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An all-out U.S.-China trade war could spark 1970s-style stagflation that would threaten the inflation-fighting reputation of the world’s central banks, Bank of Canada Governor Stephen Poloz warned Monday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“That’s a no-win situation,” he said in an interview.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Poloz identified the escalating trade tensions between the world’s two largest economies as his biggest concern for the economic outlook in 2019, and expressed annoyance that the global economy is at the mercy of self-inflicted geopolitical problems.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“It’s kind of self-created. Someone has done it,” Mr. Poloz said. “When it’s purposeful, that certainly adds another layer of frustration to my thinking.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Trump administration has threatened to slap 25-per-cent tariffs on virtually everything China sells in the United States by March 1 unless the two sides can reach a deal to defuse their trade differences.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Poloz warned that a much larger tariff hit would set off a combination of weaker growth and a dangerous spiral of inflation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We called it ‘stagflation’ in the 1970s.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. and Chinese companies can generally cope with the 10-per-cent tariffs imposed now, Mr. Poloz said. But a 25-per-cent tariff would create a burst of inflation that central banks could find very difficult to contain.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Much of the rest of the world would become “innocent bystanders” as the aftershocks of a trade war rippled across the global economy, according to Mr. Poloz.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“If you do serious damage to the global trading system, you will reduce living standards permanently,” Mr. Poloz said. “Capacity will be reduced. Productivity will be reduced permanently. And interest rates can’t do anything at all for those things.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The upward pressure on global prices could be compounded by currency depreciation among many U.S. trading partners, he added.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Central banks in Canada and elsewhere have spent a quarter-century convincing people they can tame inflation by raising interest rates when necessary. But all that could be put at risk if the United States makes good on its threats to impose much higher tariffs, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“It would erode all that credibility that’s been built into 25 years of performance, not just for us but for many countries,” Mr. Poloz said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Central banks would be faced with the need to defend that inflation record, and would not be cutting interest [rates] to bolster the economy because it was slowing down. They would be much more concerned about inflation.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Poloz said the <span class="companylink">Bank of Canada</span>’s staff is still working on its analysis of the economic fallout from the bank’s biggest near-term worry – the recent slump in the Canadian oil market. He said the bank’s economists will present him with that analysis “later this week,” along with its assessment of the broader economy, although the findings won’t be made public until Jan. 9, when the bank releases its quarterly economic projections in conjunction with its next interest-rate decision.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Earlier this month, the <span class="companylink">Bank of Canada</span> wound back expectations for further near-term rate increases and cautioned about the outlook for economic growth, in large part because of the severe weakness in prices for Canadian oil. Since then, prices for both heavy and light crude have recovered significantly, chiefly in response to the Alberta government’s announced plans to impose production cuts on the industry.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“What’s interesting is that there have been no production cuts yet. There’s just as much oil in inventory as there was two weeks ago,” Mr. Poloz said. “It tells you that a lot of that market action must be quite speculative ... It looks like that [speculative] trend got broken, so that’s a positive thing.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He said the price recovery “does complicate the analysis,” but added that the price rebound doesn’t mean the bank’s concerns surrounding the sector have dissipated.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“[Oil] revenues are suddenly higher than they were just two weeks ago,” he said. “[But] we know, of course, the more fundamental reason why Canadian prices are lower than they otherwise would be is for transportation reasons. And those have not gone away.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Poloz is confident that this latest oil slump won’t be as severe on the economy as the oil shock of 2014-15, noting both that the price decline hasn’t been as deep as in that earlier shock, and that the oil and gas sector doesn’t have as big a share of the Canadian economy as it used to.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“From a macroeconomic standpoint, the arithmetic is going to be less than what we had [in 2014-15],” Mr. Poloz said. “But I described it as ‘material’ because it is a material decline in prices, so we have to treat it as a shock and do the analysis of it.”</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Source: <span class="companylink">Desjardins Securities</span>/Bloomberg</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Here’s a brief summary of their outlook on a sector-specific basis:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Consumer Staples/Consumer Discretionary</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Analyst Keith Howlett: “The S&P/TSX Capped Consumer Discretionary Index is posting a miserable performance in 2018, with a year-to-date total return of negative 14.7 per cent, faring better than only energy stocks. 14 of the 18 constituents posted negative returns. Earnings growth of companies such as Dollarama and Canadian Tire fell slightly short of expectations, while fears of a future economic slowdown mounted. The shares were severely punished. As investors flee discretionary stocks, consumer staples are posting a 4Q rebound quarter-to-date, led by grocers. <span class="companylink">Staples</span> stocks posted a total return of 3.7 per cent year-to-date. Looking ahead, our view is that the <span class="companylink">U.S. Federal Reserve</span>’s rate decisions and balance sheet reduction initiatives will set the tone for the stock markets in 2019. The shift to the digital economy will continue to dominate the dialogue around retailers and, to a lesser extent, brand owners. We favour the best managed companies, with reasonable valuations, and relatively less exposure to the immediate threat of digital disruption.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Diversified Industrials</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Analyst David Newman: “As we enter 2019 amid the current market volatility, we continue to favour companies with strong, defensible business models as highlighted by their leading market positions, recession-resistant cash flows, reasonable debt loads and visible growth opportunities. While they are not immune to some of the current headwinds (eg rising labour, freight and debt service costs, slowing economy), we believe our top picks are well-equipped to manage through the challenges. Given we are late in the cycle with modest rate increases expected, we anticipate there could be an acceleration in M&A as companies seek to diversify their businesses, build scale and increase their exposure to higher-growth markets, driving subsequent organic growth.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Financial Services</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Analysts Doug Young, Gary Ho and Aditya Gupta: “For the Canadian banks, the focus in FY19 will be acutely on credit and whether we finally see credit trends start to turn, given we are arguably in the late stages of the credit cycle and household debt levels are elevated. Otherwise, NIM [net interest margin] expansion should continue (partially offset by deposit betas and increased competition in the commercial segment), and we believe the banks will further reduce expense ratios in order to offset slowing loan growth. For the lifecos, a sustained increase in 10/30-year bond yields would be favourable, and we see a few catalysts that should drive core EPS growth; however, sentiment could be negatively impacted if equity market volatility remains elevated. For the asset managers, we expect industry net flows to be flat to slightly higher in 2018, ETFs to continue their momentum and investors to pay greater attention to both alternative assets and expense management.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Industrials/Transportation & Aerospace</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Analyst Benoit Poirier: “2018 started on a strong note, with investors contemplating the positive impact of U.S. tax cuts implemented at the end of 2017. Supported by solid economic conditions, industrials stocks performed well in 1H18. However, fear of rising interest rates and a trade war have resulted in market uncertainties. In this report, we take a closer look at the fundamentals behind each sector. Our view is that the recent stock correction is overdone and we maintain our overall bullish stance heading into 2019.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Oil & Gas</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Analysts Justin Bouchard, Kristopher Zack and Chris MacCulloch: “Although we are cautious on the potential for significant unintended consequences stemming from Alberta production curtailments in 2019, we believe that the sharp collapse in investor sentiment has created some attractive entry points within the Canadian oil & gas sector and see better near-term support emerging for oil prices. That said, we remain biased toward producers that could benefit from the curtailments while also considering sustainability, financial flexibility and relative valuation.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Power & Utilities</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Analyst Bill Cabel: “2018 was a tough year for a majority of our IPP [independent power producer] coverage—a bit of a ‘death by a thousand cuts’ as a combination of rate hikes, political changes, below-LTA generation and quarterly misses led to periods of significant negative pressure on share prices and an overall challenging year for the sector. Going forward, bad macro news is expected to mean good news for our stocks, and we appear to be exiting 2018 with heightened fears around a possible approaching recession or bear market, which would likely soften further rate hikes and could lead to our coverage names outperforming the broader S&P/TSX index. Further, we believe the world is transitioning to decarbonization and electrification, which our names are well-positioned to take advantage of. We continue to believe that in order to generate outsized returns, our IPPs will need to continue to move into new jurisdictions and technologies—as they have done historically.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Precious Metals</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Analyst Josh Wolfson: “We continue to believe global rates have begun a period of normalization and that the cessation of extraordinary financial stimulus represents a longer-term headwind for gold. However, we do not expect rates to rise immediately and in a straight line, and we acknowledge a more constructive short-term view given heightened macro uncertainties.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Real Estate</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Analysts Michael Markidis and Kyle Stanley: “With a mere two weeks to go, it seems highly likely that 2018 will go down as a year in which the S&P/TSX Capped REIT Index (year-to-date total return of 10 per cent) significantly outperformed the broader Canadian market. We remain bullish on the operating environment in the multifamily space; however, we are cognizant of the superior run (and multiple expansion) that certain names have enjoyed throughout this year.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Telecom, Media & Tech</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Analyst Maher Yaghi: “We believe underlying trends, supported by a resilient wireless market, should continue to help the sector. However, unlike in previous years, ABPU [average billings per user] growth is likely to be muted in 2019.”</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The people who run Canada's businesses support carbon pricing. The provincial governments that oppose it are running low on fuel. The way the wind is blowing currently, carbon pricing is coming soon to a gas station near you.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Carbon pricing gained important business support in October when the Business Council of Canada, representing 150 chief executives of the largest companies, endorsed the federal government's plan. This week, the Canadian Chamber of Commerce, representing 200,000 companies across the country, supported the proposed national carbon pricing scheme and urged governments to quit using it as a political bargaining chip.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The business lobby groups have heard the objections to the federal scheme from the Conservative governments of Saskatchewan and Ontario, echoed by the federal Conservative party. They were clearly not impressed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Those two provincial governments want to argue in court that Ottawa has no authority to impose such a scheme. Ontario, having scrapped the previous government's cap-and-trade scheme (a form of carbon pricing), announced a plan to subsidize selected corporate pollution reduction efforts instead of putting a price on carbon. The business community's verdict is unequivocal: go with carbon pricing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Canadian public is of two minds about carbon pricing. People don't want to pay more for gasoline. Nor do they want to pollute the air, melt the polar ice caps and bequeath an uninhabitable planet to their grandchildren.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Angus Reid polling organization found in November that national support for carbon pricing, which had fallen to 44 per cent in July, recovered to 54 per cent after the government announced that the proceeds of the federal carbon tax would be returned to the households that pay it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ontario Premier Doug Ford had been railing against the federal scheme all summer, but public support for the federal program rose in Ontario — as it did in every province except Alberta.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The idea behind the carbon tax is that consumers of carbon products — which means oil, coal, wood, anything that produces carbon dioxide when it burns — will find their own most efficient ways of cutting carbon consumption. Schemes such as Ontario's put the government in charge of selecting emission reduction methods.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Saskatchewan appeal court will hear arguments against the federal scheme on Feb. 13 and 14. The Saskatchewan government contends that the federal tax is unconstitutional because it will apply unequally in different provinces, depending on federal assessment of the local emission reduction plans.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Saskatchewan Premier Scott Moe and his lawyers, however, have to talk their way around Section 91 of the Canadian Constitution, which gives Parliament power over “the raising of money by any mode or system of taxation."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The greatest weakness of the federal scheme is international inertia.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Canadians might submit to a carbon tax, clean up their country's emissions and still bequeath a dying planet to their grandchildren because U.S. President Donald Trump loves coal and Russian President Vladimir Putin cares nothing about the planet. Canadian business leaders, who are in the same boat with the rest of us and have studied the matter closely, have concluded that Canada should take that risk and be part of the solution, not keep adding to the problem.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Premiers Ford and Moe are left claiming to know what's good for the economy better than the business leaders who are the economy. Ottawa may well feel free to ignore them.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We're into the final weeks of 2018 and the end can't come soon enough for most investors. It's been a strange and unnerving 12 months, filled with plot twists worthy of a Shakespearean tragedy.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Back in early January, who would have believed that Canada would be deemed a strategic risk to the United States and have tariffs slapped on our steel and aluminum exports? Who would have thought that the controversy over the Trans Mountain pipeline extension would end up with Ottawa buying the beleaguered project? Who foresaw Canadian oil prices falling to record lows, deepening the recession in Alberta?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">How could we have predicted the economic and political fallout that we're now experiencing after the arrest of a Chinese business executive in Vancouver at the request of the United States?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And the list goes on and on. It has truly been a bizarre year. Unhappily, 2019 isn't looking a lot better.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So, given all the turmoil, what happened with the predictions I made back in January, in the first issue of the year? Let's take a look. Here is a list of my forecasts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. STOCKS WILL MOVE HIGHER INITIALLY, FOLLOWED BY A CORRECTION OF MORE THAN 10 PER CENT I wrote that U.S. tax reform and deregulation would result in an early surge in the markets. That's exactly what happened.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The tax cuts fattened profits and deregulation encouraged more business investment. Markets soared and hit record highs over the summer. But investors got a little too exuberant and pushed valuations to unsustainable levels, especially in the tech sector.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The S&P 500 topped out at 2,930.75 on Sept. 20. It then fell all the way to 2,633.08 on Dec. 7, a decline of 10.16 per cent from the peak. The Nasdaq Composite dropped even more, from a high of 8,109.69 on Aug.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">29 to 6,908.82 on Nov. 20. That represented a loss of 14.8 per cent from the peak.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Dow fared a little better, although it is well down from the high of 26,825.39 touched on Oct. 4. On Dec. 14, it slipped into correction territory, down more than 10 per cent from the peak, and continued its slide on Monday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">HIGHER INTEREST RATES This call was a no-brainer. Rates had already started to move up in 2017 and with the U.S. economy gaining momentum, it was a sure thing the process would continue in 2018. The only question was by how much. I suggested the <span class="companylink">U.S. Federal Reserve Board</span> would tighten at least three times and that the <span class="companylink">Bank of Canada</span> would move at least twice. So far, the Fed has raised rates three times in 2018, with the final meeting of the year scheduled for Dec. 1819. The <span class="companylink">Bank of Canada</span> has increased rates three times.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">RETURN OF INFLATION At the start of the year, inflation was already above 2 per cent in both Canada and the United States and the strength of the U.S. economy combined with low unemployment suggested it would move higher.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. inflation did spike to close to 3 per cent in midsummer, but has since retreated to 2.2 per cent in November. Canada followed a similar pattern. Inflation hit a high of 3 per cent in July, but has since eased off. According to <span class="companylink">Statistics Canada</span>, the October figure was 2.4 per cent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These numbers are slightly higher than at the start of the year, but not by a lot. And with economists predicting a slowdown in the North American economy in 2019, inflation does not look to be as much of a concern as I expected.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">BOND MARKET WOES I wrote that rising interest rates would put pressure on bond prices in 2018. We did see some softening and most bond funds are in negative territory year-to-date. There has also been some inversion in the yield curve. However, it may come as a surprise that the FTSE Russell Canadian Universe Bond Index is actually slightly in the black year-to-date, by 0.38 per cent as of Dec. 13.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">TRADE WARS DEEPEN I took U.S. President Donald Trump at his word on this and, unfortunately, he kept it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He slapped tariffs on Canadian steel and aluminum, threatened us with auto tariffs and set off an alarming trade war with China that could lead to real trouble in 2019 unless both sides de-escalate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">THE LOONIE WILL FALL At the beginning of January, the Canadian dollar was worth about 80 US cents, meaning it cost about $1.25 to buy one greenback. Today, the loonie is down to about 75 US cents and you need about $1.33 to get an American dollar.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Several factors have contributed to this, including the steep decline in the price of Canadian oil, the trade difficulties with the United States, the gap between Canadian and U.S. interest rates, and the decline in foreign investment in this country.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Except for the inflation scenario, my projections for 2018 were pretty much on the mark. But looking ahead, we are in uncharted territory and 2019 looks to be a difficult one for investors. I'll have more to say on that in a future column.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The group, which represents more than 125,000 realtors, is projecting that home sales across the country will decline to the lowest point in nine years but stay little changed from 2018, falling only by 0.5 per cent to 456,200 units.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CREA is projecting that the national average price for a home sold through its multiple-listing service system will rise 1.7 per cent to $496,800 in 2019.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The association forecasts a rebound in sales activity in Ontario and continuing gains in Quebec.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales were anticipated to fall next year in Alberta and British Columbia.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“In 2019, home sales activity and prices are expected to be held in check by recent policy changes from different levels of government, in addition to additional interest rate increases," the group said in a forecast released on Monday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CREA has also revised down its projections for 2018, now saying that it expects national home sales will decline by 11.2 per cent to 458,200 units in 2018 – the lowest level in five years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The group says B.C. and Ontario will make up the majority of this year's decline, while sales in Alberta, Saskatchewan, Manitoba and Newfoundland and Labrador will also fall to multiyear lows.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The national forecast has been revised lower … as an anticipated rebound in sales in British Columbia has so far failed to materialize, the recovery in Ontario sales this summer has now run its course and sales activity in Alberta has edged lower. These developments were partially offset by stronger-than-expected sales activity in Quebec," it said in the report.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The association noted that sales in Quebec and in the Maritimes, particularly New Brunswick, were still anticipated to remain “historically strong."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">National average home prices were slated to end this year down 4.2 per cent to $488,600 from 2017.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CREA attributed 2018's price drop to a 2.6-per-cent year-overyear decline in Ontario as fewer higher-price homes were put up for sale in Toronto, especially during the spring market, which often sees a price surge.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Toronto, the decline in average home prices this year is stark in contrast because the housing market in Canada's largest city had been “unusually strong" in 2017.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“As we look to 2019, the major battle lines seem fairly clearly drawn, with the market still supported by strong population growth on the one side, and challenging affordability [past price gains and rate rises] on the other," said Doug Porter, chief economist at BMO Economics in an analyst note.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“While we expect sales activity to stabilize next year … we nevertheless anticipate that prices will slow even further to gains likely below that of inflation."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Porter also pointed out that there were a lot of variances regionally in relation to average sales and prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For instance, the housing market in Ontario's medium-sized cities continued to show strength, with both London and Windsor posting double-digit gains in 2018. While smaller cities in Ontario, Quebec and Maritimes registered price gains that put that in a “healthy" balanced market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Oil price declines have also wreaked havoc on housing prices in Western Canada, while the largest sales decline this year was in B.C., which has largely been attributed to an increase in the foreign-buyers' tax.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The tone-deafness and hypocrisy of politicians in Whistler is almost as breathtaking as the mountain scenery and the ski resort's 1,530-metre vertical drop.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Little more than a year ago, former mayor Nancy Wilhelm-Morden stirred up trouble with her comments about day-trippers from Vancouver adding nothing but garbage to the mountain culture.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tourism Whistler CEO Barrett Fisher chimed in that the town's focus should be on attracting the "right guests."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But that's nothing. Mayor Jack Crompton has now sparked a boycott of the resort and inflamed an already testy and aggrieved relationship between Alberta and British Columbia.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He wrote a letter to Calgary-based oil company <span class="companylink">Canadian Natural Resources Ltd</span>. asking it to pay its "fair share" of the municipality's climate-change costs, including Whistler's $1.4-million wildfire protection budget.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Singling out that particular company was odd. Yes, it is an oilsands producer. But its Canadian owner, Murray Edwards, is also an investor with Bill Gates in Squamishbased Carbon Engineering, which is developing technology to capture CO2 from the air and synthesize it into transportation fuel.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And what makes the mayor's letter and his subsequent grovelling video so terribly ironic is that Crompton is in the transportation business. After founding and selling Resort Cabs, he launched Transportation Whistler and RideBooker, which help tourists get the 140 kilometres to and from Vancouver International Airport.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Transportation is Canada's second-highest source of greenhouse-gas emissions after the oil and gas industry. It's also Whistler's lifeline. To put the environmental cost of transportation to Whistler into context, here are some calculations from an online offset website.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last year, three million people visited Whistler - an increase from the previous year because more tourists came from the U.S., Mexico, Australia and Britain.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Offsetting a single economy passenger's share of the CO2 emissions on a return flight to Mexico City or New York City of 1.3 tonnes is estimated at $26. To be carbon-neutral, economy class passengers from London and Sydney, Australia would have to cough up $50 and $82.80 respectively. The cost quadruples for first-class travellers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For a back-of-envelope calculation, if you figure a million visitors arrived by plane, multiply that by $26 and ... well, you get the idea.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That said, I have some empathy for Whistler's leaders.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They're small-town politicians in the glare of the international spotlight, who seem to be responding to the wishes of the people who vote for them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But they're not like their counterparts in similarly sized Powell River. It barely made the local news when its council joined the campaign promoted by West Coast Environmental Law, and fired off letters to oil companies demanding that they pay their share.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The same is true for West Vancouver's council, which approved sending letters on Dec. 10.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even Victoria didn't get much attention, although <span class="companylink">Total SA</span> replied that it "cannot be held liable for the consequences of climate change."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For Whistler's politicians, they are caught in an increasingly uncomfortable bind.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Is it more important to work for the people who elect them or protect the company and industry that sustains them? For the politicians and their electors, Whistler is their community, their home where they want to raise their children and grow old. Their worries are similar to other B.C. municipalities. Housing affordability dominates the conversation while multimillion-dollar mansions sit empty except for a few days or weeks each year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With employees often having to compete with tourists for rental accommodation, business owners worry about finding enough staff.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But then there's the conundrum that if you build more, how do you do that without destroying more of the surrounding pristine environment, which attracted everyone in the first place? Yet, here's the big difference.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Unlike most of the rest of British Columbia, this is a purpose-built resort municipality. It's like Disneyland, existing for the pleasure of visitors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With the munificence of provincial and federal taxpayers who have helped build the infrastructure to both access and enjoy the resort, it's been an enormous success.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's grown into an economic engine for the province. But its continued success depends on outsiders - both the Americans who own <span class="companylink">Vail Resorts</span> and the "right guests" who come for more than a pristine environment with gold and platinum credit cards in hand.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Whistler's politicians ought to know that, especially Crompton.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Not only do his companies depend on it, his grandparents in the 1960s were original shareholders in the Garibaldi Lift Company. It was formed to build a ski resort and bid for the 1968 Olympics and was the genesis of Whistler, which has carried on the "if-you-buildit-they-will-come" belief through the 2010 Winter Olympics and beyond.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, there's a conceit in Whistler that somehow it is different from other company towns such as Fort Mc-Murray and Tumbler Ridge or ghost towns like Uranium City.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the only real difference is that Whistler is selling pleasure, not petroleum, into an increasingly glutted market.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prime Minister Justin Trudeau says he is overhauling how Canada assesses big energy projects in a bid to ensure new projects can get built without the government having to buy them to make that happen.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We're going to work to make sure that we're creating a system where you don't have to pass a law to get a pipeline built, you don't have to buy an energy project in order to de-risk it," Trudeau said in an interview with The Canadian Press.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We want an energy sector where the private sector has confidence in getting our resources to markets."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The government's $4.5 billion purchase of the Trans Mountain pipeline was one of the biggest - and possibly most unexpected - political manoeuvres the Liberals made in 2018. The government bought it from <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span> at the end of the summer after political opposition to expanding the pipeline gave the company and its investors cold feet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Trans Mountain hit a major snag in August when the Federal Court of Appeal tore up federal approval for the expansion citing insufficient environment and Indigenous consultations. The government is trying to get it back on track by redoing parts of those consultations to do what the court said was lacking.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Trudeau believes his government's Impact Assessment Act will fix a flawed review process that created the uncertainty around Trans Mountain. Bill C-69 is one of the last big pieces of legislation the government wants passed before the next election - and potentially it is in for a very rough ride.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The bill sets in place new timelines and parameters for reviews, lifts limits set by the previous Conservatives on who can participate in the process, and creates an early-phase consultation with Indigenous communities and anyone else impacted by the project to identify concerns.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Trudeau said is open to amendments if it makes the bill better, but added he won't agree to dropping the legislation entirely. He said not passing the legislation is not an option if Canadians want to see their resources developed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"No matter how much we're investing in the knowledge economy and education, Canada will always have a core of natural resources as an important part of our economy," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A Senate committee is scheduled to start hearings on C-69 at the end of January, but the bill faces stiff opposition from Conservative senators spurred by an angry oil industry and the Alberta government.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Conservative natural resources critic Shannon Stubbs said if the law is approved, there won't be any new energy projects like pipelines approved in Canada because no investor would believe it could withstand the tests required under C-69.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Stubbs said she thinks the bill needs to be scrapped altogether, or at the very least remove the discretion for the government to put the proposed two-year review process on hold. She also wants the government to rework the bill so that environmental assessments only contemplate greenhouse gas emissions produced by the pipeline itself and not those produced by the refining process.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The bill does not specifically require upstream emissions be looked at.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rather, the legislation says the project has to be considered in terms of its impact on Canada meeting its greenhouse gas reduction targets.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The pro-pipeline event, supported by all 14 Calgary councillors in addition to Mayor Naheed Nenshi, was organized by Canada Action, a movement that supports the natural resources sector. Thousands turned out at Municipal Plaza over the lunch hour, chanting "build our future" as the rally got underway.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But some members of council were heckled as they stood at the podium to declare their solidarity with those in the struggling oil and gas sector, including Coun. Peter Demong.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"This is not a time to be talking about boycotts or trade embargoes. We want to encourage trade, not restrict it," Demong said, describing Alberta oil as "one of most ethical sources of energy on planet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We need to be spreading the word about how this industry is a world leader in gender equality. We should be talking about how to support Quebec's dairy industry by buying Canadian cheese. We should be talking about supporting Ontar ..." he said, stopping to address jeers from the crowd. "Wow. Really? And you guys call yourselves Canadians? Wow," said Demong, before stepping away from the podium.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nenshi, who immediately took over, faced a mix of cheers and discontent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I believe strongly that what we do here in this place is right for this community, it's right for the province, it's right for the country and it's right for the world," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"But our job is to continue to change minds one at a time. It's important for us to remember that standing up for Canadian energy is not a partisan issue."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nenshi said it's also important to note that "standing up for Canadian energy doesn't mean we don't believe in and care about climate change," a point met with some booing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Well, for those of you who are saying 'No, I don't believe in climate change,'good luck changing hearts and minds because we have to be able to say that there is no difference between standing up for the economy and standing up for the environment," he said, as jeering turned to applause.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We can do both and that's what people in the oil and gas sector do every single day."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Later booed again as he began delivering remarks in French, the mayor had a message for the crowd.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Let me give you a little bit of advice," he said, switching back to English. "If you want someone to listen to you, you have to speak their language."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Frustrated attendees, holding pro-energy signs with messages ranging from "I (heart) oil & gas" to "Quebec hypocrisy" said feelings of Alberta separatism are as prominent as they can recall.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They said Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and the federal government are to blame for the predicament in which Alberta finds itself.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"They won't get my vote next time," said Pat Fryers, who added that Premier Rachel Notley has been a "great spokesperson for us."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fryers said her son, a geologist, is unemployed due to the state of the economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Alberta Energy Minister Margaret McCuaig-Boyd dismissed the notion that divisiveness and even separatism would in any way help Alberta's energy sector.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I think we're always better together to work. I'm a proud Canadian. Despite the frustration I feel about how we're being treated in Alberta, I'm still a proud Canadian ... When we're divisive, we're not going to get anywhere," she said.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He concludes that "Equalized resentment may be equalization's most lasting legacy." I concur with Coyne's conclusion (as I usually do). My only grievance is that Coyne did not reach a second conclusion regarding the audacity of Quebec's negative stance on pipeline development.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Coyne's premise that Alberta's "fiscal capacity" results from its oil wealth leads to his conclusion that Alberta's "fiscal capacity ... is also much higher than the national average," which justifies why Albertans pay a disproportionate share of federal taxes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It follows that if Alberta did not have this oil wealth, Alberta's contribution to the federal tax base would be much diminished as would be Canada's ability to generate equalization payments. In essence, Alberta's oil wealth has significantly contributed to the federal tax base and to the distribution of equalization payments within Canada and particularly to Quebec.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now consider Premier François Legault's assertion that there is no "social acceptability" for Alberta's "dirty energy" in Quebec. This statement is blatantly hypocritical, beyond words, given that the tax revenue generated by Alberta's supposed "dirty oil" has been socially accepted by Quebec for decades as it gleefully continues to gobble up equalization payments. Shame on you, Premier Legault!</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CALGARY—Demonstrators at Monday's pro-oil rally at Calgary's city hall were told to show up with positive attitudes and without yellow vests — a French symbol of protest against economic inequality that's been co-opted by Canadians opposed to carbon taxes and irregular immigration.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Not everyone did.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The rally, organized by Canada Action, a pro-oil advocacy group, was intended to showcase local support in the nerve centre of Alberta's oil and gas industry. More than 500 passionate, but mostly positive demonstrators showed up at noon on Monday to listen to a bevy of speakers, including Mayor Naheed Nenshi. But some also booed references to Quebec, whose premier recently suggested there wasn't any “social acceptability” for oil in the province, and even heckled the mayor.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The frustration comes as an oil differential between Canadian heavy crude and American medium crude narrows, but an approval process for the Trans Mountain pipeline expansion drags on.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We have to stop shooting ourselves in the foot as Canadians and we have to start supporting the energy sector — the foundation of our economy,” Cody Battershill, founder of Canada Action, told the crowd to cheers and applause.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many demonstrators carried signs denouncing Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, the lack of movement on new pipeline projects, and Bill C-69 — a federal bill that restricts supertankers from landing along Canada's West Coast — and cheered at calls to revitalize Canada's energy sector. Councillors Peter Demong, Jyoti Gondek, and Ward Sutherland also praised the industry. The whole council chipped in $500 each from their office budgets to promote and organize the rally.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When Nenshi tried to make a short statement in French at the request of the event's organizers, a loud chorus of boos echoed around the rally. Demong also found himself booed when he suggested Canadians should support Quebec's dairy sector as well as oil and gas. Nenshi was even heckled by demonstrators when he referred to climate change. Visibly angry, he broke off his speech to rebuke them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“For those of you who are saying no, I don't believe in climate change? Good luck changing hearts and minds,” Nenshi said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A handful of demonstrators also showed up in yellow vests, a nod to an ongoing protest movement in France against economic inequality and the high cost of living for French residents forced to commute long distances for work. Canadians opposed to carbon taxes, as well as a nonbinding <span class="companylink">UN</span> pact on migration Canada recently signed, have since co-opted the yellow vest as a symbol of their anger with the federal government. Counter-protesters have accused Canadian yellow-vest supporters as harbouring racist and anti-immigrant views.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">JoAnne Labunski showed up to Monday's rally in a black Syncrude jacket, not a yellow vest, but said she's part of the movement. She also used to work in the office of an oil-and-gas company before being laid off three years ago. Since then, she's gone from living in a condo to applying for subsidized housing. Finding full-time work has been difficult.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“There's so many people out of work,” Labunski said. “It's not 30 people applying for a job anymore. It's 300 or more applying for a job. So, it's been really difficult.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other demonstrators at the rally didn't have skin in the game anymore, but had concerns for prospective oilpatch workers trying to get their foot in the door. Colin MacDonald, who used to own a geophysics company (and did wear a yellow vest), said he blames Premier Rachel Notley — and the federal government — for the state of Canada's oil and gas industry.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“It's fine for me because I'm basically retired,” he said. “But a lot of young people are suffering and it's because of people that don't know what they're doing, especially in Ottawa.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Labunski's frustration includes the lack of new pipelines and concerns over Canadian imports of oil from Saudi Arabia. But it also overlaps with criticism of the federal carbon tax and concerns that by signing a nonbinding <span class="companylink">UN</span> pact, Canada is “giving away our sovereignty.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MacDonald said he supported the yellow vest movement too, although he didn't know if Canada's version of it “should get as wild as it did in France.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Battershill said he couldn't speak to the presence of the yellow vests at Monday's rally. Canada Action organizers told demonstrators not to arrive at the rally with them on, but Battershill noted they weren't breaking the law.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We're really about a balanced, positive, respectful, non-partisan conversation,” he said. “And I can't speak to what the yellow vests or any other movements are doing.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Shortly before the rally began, city council had been debating a motion on exploring ways to support Alberta's energy industry. Councillors unanimously passed part of the motion, agreeing to declare the oil price differential a crisis and solidifying formal support for the province's oil industry and construction of new pipelines.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other sections, including directing city administration to explore advocacy, like legal or educational moves, were referred to council's intergovernmental affairs committee.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ward 11 Councillor Jeromy Farkas originally brought the motion forward, but his name was removed after he wouldn't withdraw a line that claimed City of Calgary has funded “drastic anti-pipeline advocacy” in the past.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nenshi said he was “shocked” to see that in Farkas's notice of motion and he wouldn't accept it. Farkas said he was referring to a workshop offered by an environmental advocacy group that past Ward 11 councillor Brian Pincott paid to attend. Nenshi said councillors went to those sessions to learn about other points of view, and he wouldn't accept the portrayal in Farkas's motion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“If you're decrying misinformation, you can't add to it,” he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Farkas's condemnation nonetheless drew the approval of United Conservative Party Leader Jason Kenney, who praised the city councillor's efforts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We need to start fighting back, including by not funding the groups that undermine our workers,” Kenney wrote on his Twitter account Monday afternoon.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Councillors expressed support for the motion, but many also said that the city — and individual councillors — have long advocated for oil and gas in Alberta.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I don't believe it's a challenge that's just been accepted because I do believe we've been speaking and effectively voicing our concerns on this quite regularly,” Demong said. “It never hurts to bring even more firepower to the station.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Public relations and organizing for Monday's rally has also been paid for out of the office budgets of city councillors. Sutherland previously said each council member pledged $500 from their office budgets to cover these costs, despite the fact the city employs dozens of communications staff, including several with video and editing skills.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Monday's rally came on the heels of one held in Grande Prairie on Sunday that drew thousands of demonstrators and politicians from both sides of the aisle, including Kenney and NDP Minister of Economic Development and Trade Deron Bilous.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite city council's support over the years, Nenshi said it's still necessary to show Canadians outside of Alberta the industry's importance.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We have long been very vocal advocates for Canada's energy industry and it's important that we do so publicly and that we do so in a way that people across Canada can hear our voices and understand what's happening here,” Nenshi said.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The rally, organized by Canada Action — a pro-oil advocacy group — was intended to showcase local support in the nerve centre of Alberta's oil and gas industry. It came on the heels of a rally held in Grande Prairie, Alta., on Sunday that drew thousands of demonstrators and politicians from both sides of the aisle, including United Conservative Party Leader Jason Kenney and NDP Minister of Economic Development and Trade Deron Bilous.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We have to stop shooting ourselves in the foot as Canadians and we have to start supporting the energy sector — the foundation of our economy,” Cody Battershill, founder of Canada Action, told the crowd to cheers. He previously told StarMetro he expected between 500 to 1,000 people would show up.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mayor Naheed Nenshi, as well as Councillors Peter Demong, Jyoti Gondek, and Ward Sutherland, all extolled the oil and gas sector, and its importance to Calgary, in speeches to the lively, sometimes angry crowd assembled.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“This isn't about entitled Albertans and their big trucks — though we like our big trucks,” Nenshi told the crowd. “It is about doing what's right. It's about doing what's right for Canada. It's about doing what's right for the world.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Most of the crowd was relatively positive, but some members booed at mentions of Quebec or the federal government. A few even took issue with Nenshi mentioning climate change. He rebuked them from the podium, saying “good luck changing hearts and minds” of opponents to Canada's oil industry.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Shortly before the rally began, city council had been debating a motion on exploring ways to support Alberta's energy industry. Councillors unanimously passed part of the motion, agreeing to declare the oil price differential a crisis and solidifying formal support for the province's oil industry and construction of new pipelines. Other sections, including directing city administration to explore advocacy, like legal or educational moves, were referred to council's intergovernmental affairs committee.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ward 11 Councillor Jeromy Farkas originally brought the motion forward, but his name was removed after he wouldn't withdraw a line that claimed City of Calgary has funded “drastic anti-pipeline advocacy” in the past.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nenshi said he was “shocked” to see that in Farkas's notice of motion and he wouldn't accept it. Farkas said he was referring to a workshop offered by an environmental advocacy group that past Ward 11 councillor Brian Pincott paid to attend.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nenshi said councillors went to those sessions to learn about other points of view, and he wouldn't accept the portrayal in Farkas's motion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“If you're decrying misinformation, you can't add to it,” he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Councillors expressed support for the motion, but many also said that the city — and individual councillors — have long advocated for oil and gas in Alberta.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I don't believe it's a challenge that's just been accepted because I do believe we've been speaking and effectively voicing our concerns on this quite regularly,” Demong said. “It never hurts to bring even more firepower to the station.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nenshi later told reporters the motion is still necessary to show Canadians outside of Alberta the importance of the industry.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We have long been very vocal advocates for Canada's energy industry and it's important that we do so publicly and that we do so in a way that people across Canada can hear our voices and understand what's happening here,” Nenshi said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Public relations and organizing for Monday's rally has also been paid for out of the office budgets of city councillors. Sutherland previously said each council member pledged $500 from their office budgets to cover these costs, despite the fact the city employs dozens of communications staff, including several with video and editing skills.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The event page for Monday's rally asks all attendees to be respectful. Canada Action also asked demonstrators to not show up in yellow vests, a symbol co-opted from ongoing protests in France against economic inequality. “Yellow vest” demonstrators protested in Edmonton on Saturday against irregular immigration and a lack of action on pipelines. Counterprotesters accused them of racism.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">However, at least a dozen yellow-vested demonstrators — some of whom identified as members of the movement — were present at the rally.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CALGARY—Hundreds of protesters are expected to fill the south side of Calgary's city hall at noon on Monday for a pro-oil and gas rally co-ordinated in part by sympathetic city councillors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The rally, organized by Canada Action — a pro-oil advocacy group — is intended to showcase local support in the nerve centre of Alberta's oil and gas industry. It comes on the heels of a rally held in Grande Prairie, Alta., on Sunday that drew thousands of demonstrators and politicians from both sides of the aisle, including United Conservative Party Leader Jason Kenney and NDP Minister of Economic Development and Trade Deron Bilous.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The Mayor and all of council will be on location supporting pipelines and the energy sector,” reads a statement on a Facebook page for Monday's event[https://www.facebook.com/events/281962042666428/]. “Please join us, and help spread the good message about our energy sector!”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The rally also comes as city council debates a notice of motion from Councillor Jeromy Farkas calling for the city to make an official statement of support for Alberta oil and pipelines. It would direct city bureaucrats to explore “advocacy options,” review other cities' efforts to influence pipeline construction and consider withdrawing from associations like the Federation of Canadian Municipalities (FCM).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Cody Battershill, the founder of Canada Action, previously told StarMetro that Monday's rally is expected to attract between 500 to 1,000 people of all political stripes. Mayor Naheed Nenshi, along with Councillors Jyoti Gondek, Peter Demong and Ward Sutherland are all slated to speak at the event.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We're all Canadian,” said Battershill. “It doesn't matter who you vote for, making sure people are employed and families have food on the table matters regardless of whether you're so-called left or so-called right.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Canada Action describes itself as a grassroots organization, funded out of pocket through T-shirt sales, but has increasingly accepted donations from unions, First Nations, and the construction and energy sectors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Public relations and organizing for Monday's rally has also been paid for out of the office budgets of several city councillors. Sutherland previously said each council member pledged $500 from their office budgets to cover these costs, despite the fact the city employs dozens of communications staff, including several with video and editing skills.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">City council also spent most of Monday morning debating a motion on exploring ways to support Alberta's energy industry. Councillors unanimously passed part of the motion, agreeing to declare the oil price differential a crisis and solidifying formal support for the province's oil industry and construction of new pipelines. Other sections, including directing city administration to explore advocacy, like legal or educational moves, were referred to council's intergovernmental affairs committee.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Farkas originally brought the motion forward, but his name was removed after he wouldn't withdraw a line that claimed City of Calgary has funded “drastic anti-pipeline advocacy” in the past.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nenshi said he was “shocked” to see that in Farkas's notice of motion and he wouldn't accept it. Farkas said he was referring to a workshop offered by an environmental advocacy group that past Ward 11 councillor Brian Pincott paid to attend.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nenshi said councillors went to those sessions to learn about other points of view, and he wouldn't accept the portrayal in Farkas's motion.</p>

Counterprotesters accused them of racism.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">However, a moderator with Canada Action asked demonstrators to leave their yellow vests at home.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Cequence has utilized the full $8.6 million raised through its recently completed rights offering to fund the successful drilling and completion of 2 gross (2 net) Dunvegan oil wells as eligible Canadian development expense. The 10-4-62-26W5 and 16-02-62-26W5 Dunvegan oil wells have lateral lengths of 2,100 m and 1,450 m, with 50 and 40 completion stages cemented in place respectively. Following their completion, the wells were brought online for clean up during the week of December 3, 2018, and flowed through temporary test equipment for approximately 5 days each. During the last 24 hour flow period the 10-4-62-26W5 well produced approximately 250 bbl/d of oil and 578 bbl/d of water with 11% of completion water recovered, while the 16-02-62-26W5 well produced 264 bbl/d of oil and 447 bbl/d of water with 7% of completion water recovered. The wells have been shut in awaiting connection to permanent production facilities and for pumping equipment to be installed. The Company is encouraged by the initial flow results and expects the wells should produce at or above the first month internal model of 300 bbl/d of oil. These initial well test results are preliminary only as no pressure transient analysis or well-test impressions have been carried out, and these test results are not necessarily indicative of long-term performance or ultimate recovery.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Boe Conversions: Barrel of oil equivalent ("boe") amounts have been calculated by using the conversion ratio of six thousand cubic feet (6 Mcf) of natural gas to one barrel of oil (1 bbl). Boe amounts may be misleading, particularly if used in isolation. A boe conversion ratio of 6 Mcf to 1 bbl is based on an energy equivalency conversion method primarily applicable at the burner tip and does not represent a value equivalency at the wellhead. Given that the value ratio based on the current price of oil as compared to natural gas is significantly different from the energy equivalent of 6:1, utilizing a conversion on a 6:1 basis may be misleading as an indication of value.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mcfe Conversions: Thousands of cubic feet of gas equivalent ("Mcfe") amounts have been calculated by using the conversion ratio of one barrel of oil (1 bbl) to six thousand cubic feet (6 Mcf) of natural gas. Mcfe amounts may be misleading, particularly if used in isolation. A conversion ratio of 1 bbl to 6 Mcf is based on an energy equivalency conversion method primarily applicable at the burner tip and does not represent a value equivalency at the wellhead. Given that the value ratio based on the current price of natural gas as compared to oil is significantly different from the energy equivalent of 1:6, utilizing a conversion on a 1:6 basis may be misleading as an indication of value.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“If you build it, they will come.” Those may be inspirational words, but for commercial developers in Canada who hope to build near transit lines, they can be frustrating.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Build what? When? Where? Across Canada, developers are confronted with a dilemma – it can be lucrative and good city planning to construct commercial projects that have access to new transit, but transit takes years of planning and many cities have trouble making decisions about where to run their lines.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Clearly there is a desire to acquire development opportunities near mass transit growth – the city will promote higher densities, and both residential and commercial rents are going to be higher, resulting in shorter lease-up and higher final values. You want to own real estate where the people mass,” says David Lehberg, founder and chief executive officer of Knightstone Capital Management Inc., a Toronto-based property developer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even when projects are under way, they’re not necessarily a certainty. Many Ontarians recall when then-premier Mike Harris cancelled an Eglinton Avenue West subway line in Toronto that was already under construction in 1995, filling in a tunnel; a light rapid transit (LRT) line along the same road is now being built, at considerably greater cost.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“For a major [commercial] project, land development is a 10-year undertaking from acquiring the land to opening the finished product,” says Andrew McAllan, head of real estate management at <span class="companylink">Oxford Properties Group</span>, one of Canada’s biggest commercial developers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The issue for Oxford and other developers is that assembling land around transit corridors depends on local and regional governments determining where they want the transit to be built.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. McAllan is a strong advocate of green and sustainable building practices, which include putting up projects near transit, but the uncertainty over transit decisions makes even the strongest advocates skittish, he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Having certainty is critical, and in the absence, you see hesitation not just on the part of the developer, but also the lender. These are multimillion-dollar projects that rely on financing, and if you don’t have certainty, people are hesitant to commit,” he explains.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It’s not that Canada’s cities aren’t trying. But just as land assembly and financing by developers takes years, transit routes depend on decisions made by multiple levels of governments, as well as planning officials who don’t always necessarily agree, or who change their minds or are forced to accept construction delays.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Building better transit seems to be a slow process almost everywhere:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">— In Ottawa, the opening of a new $2.1-billion, 13-stop east-west LRT line that was supposed to be ready May 24 has been delayed twice and is now not scheduled to open until next year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">— In British Columbia, the 21-member Mayors’ Council in the province’s Lower Mainland announced a $7-billion transit and transportation upgrade, with provincial and federal funding, but there has been pushback from residents of Surrey who don’t like the $1.65-billion LRT line slated to serve that city.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">— Calgary had been considering a rapid transit link to its airport with its downtown, but a rejection in November by voters of the city’s 2026 Winter Olympics makes the link a lower priority now.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">— Edmonton is building at least 13 kilometres of LRT at a cost of $1.8-billion, but commercial building decisions in Alberta may be affected by oil prices, which slumped to their lowest point in more than a year in late November.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">— Hamilton is on deck to build a 13-kilometre LRT line, with the Ontario government promising to pay 100 per cent of the capital cost up to $1-billion. But some city council members don’t want the project, which if started right away would take until 2024 to open.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">— Mississauga is scheduled to complete a $1.5-billion transit line that would transform a major artery, Hurontario Street, but Ontario Premier Doug Ford says his government has not decided whether to go ahead with the project, which would be completed by 2022 if on schedule.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">— The entire Greater Toronto and Hamilton Area (GTHA) appears to be perpetually mired in an endless debate over where and when to build new transit, even though all governments and the private sector agree that it is needed badly. Construction of the $3.5-billion Eglinton Crosstown LRT is well under way, but well behind its original schedule and not slated to open until 2021.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While it’s certain that politicians and bureaucrats will continue to squabble about the size and shape of transit projects, there are ways to speed up decision-making, says Lindsay Wiginton, managing director for transportation and urban solutions for the Pembina Institute, an environmental think-tank.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a recent blog post, she notes that “smart growth” plans that encourage intensified development around transit corridors can help determine the transit that gets built, which, logically, would give developers and lenders more certainty.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“But growth policy is only one piece of the puzzle,” Ms. Wiginton says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Municipalities should look at ideas such as limiting parking around key new transit stops, to free up land and encourage more people to use the transit lines. Flexible zoning would also help, because with the long timelines for transit, it’s difficult to determine what kind of commercial development will thrive when a line is eventually built, she suggests.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The presumption is that mass transit will be a success,” Mr. Lehberg of Knightstone says. "The problem is the waiting … and trying to figure out where and when the transit will be built.”</p>

</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Corporation announces that its 2019 capital budget is US$ 119 million, which will be fully funded from existing cash and 2019 cash flow. Forecast realized contractual gas sales for 2019, which include downtime, are anticipated to average approximately 179 million standard cubic feet per day (“MMscfpd”), assuming June 1, 2019 for the completion of the <span class="companylink">Promigas S.A</span>. (“<span class="companylink">Promigas</span>”) pipeline expansion. Based on the Corporation’s current portfolio of 2019 gas contracts, the average sales price, net of transportation costs where applicable, is approximately US$ 4.75/Mcf. Oil sales are expected to average approximately 400 barrels of oil per day until such time as the Corporation disposes of its interest in the Rancho Hermoso oil field, its only remaining conventional oil asset.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Charle Gamba, President and CEO of Canacol, stated, “For 2019, the Corporation is focused on the following objectives: 1) completion of the expansion of the Jobo gas processing facility during first quarter, which will lift gas treatment capacity from current levels of 200 MMscfpd to 330 MMscfpd in advance of the completion of the <span class="companylink">Promigas</span> gas pipeline expansion scheduled by June 1, 2019, which will lift gas sales to approximately 215 MMscfpd from current levels in excess of 130 MMscfpd, 2) the drilling of 8 exploration, appraisal and development wells in a continuous program, and 3) execution of a definitive agreement to construct a new gas pipeline from Jobo to either Medellin or Barranquilla, increasing the Corporation’s gas sales by an additional 100 MMscfpd in 2021 to a total sales level greater than 300 MMscfpd.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">2019 Forecast Gas Sales</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On December 1, 2018, <span class="companylink">Promigas S.A</span>. provided approximately 20 MMscfpd of new transportation capacity between Jobo and Cartagena which lifted gas sales to current levels in excess of 130 MMscfpd from an average of 115 MMscfpd for third quarter 2018. The Corporation anticipates that by June 1, 2019, upon the completion of the <span class="companylink">Promigas</span> pipeline expansion, the Corporation’s gas sales will be lifted by an additional 80 MMscfpd to approximately 215 MMscfpd, which includes anticipated downtime, for the remainder of 2019.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">2019 Capital</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Highlights of the Corporation’s capital spending program for 2019 include 1) the drilling of five exploration and appraisal wells and three development wells for a total of US$ 50 million, 2) facilities expansion and equipment for a total of US$ 30 million, 3) the acquisition of 155 square kilometers of 3D seismic on the VIM 5 contract for a total of US$ 16 million to firm up exploration drilling locations for 2020, and 4) pre-operative seismic, workover, trailing, social, and other costs for a total of approximately US$ 23 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The gas exploration wells planned for 2019 include the Acordeon-1 and Saxofon-1 exploration wells on Canacol’s operated 100% working interest VIM 5 contract, and the Arandala-1 exploration well on Canacol’s operated 100% working interest Esperanza contract. Appraisal wells Pandereta-5 and Clarinete-4 are planned for its VIM 5 contract, while appraisal well Palmer-2 and development wells Nelson-7 and Canahuate-2 are planned for its Esperanza contract. Flexibility has been built into the 2019 drilling program such that in the event of exploration success, funds may be reallocated for immediate follow-up appraisal drilling locations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Corporation spudded the infill development well Nelson-13 in early December 2018, which is anticipated to be cased and completed by year end 2018. Upon completion of the Nelson-13 well, the drilling rig will be mobilized to drill the first of the 2019 eight well drilling program, the Palmer-2 appraisal well, which is anticipated to spud in mid January, 2019, which will be followed by the Nelson-7 infill development well spudding mid February, 2019, and then the Acordeon-1 exploration well spudding in late March 2019. The Corporation will provide continuous updates of its 2019 drilling program as each well is completed.</p>

("Cardinal" or the "Company") (TSX: CJ) is pleased to announce that the Toronto Stock Exchange (the "TSX") has accepted the notice of Cardinal's intention to commence a normal course issuer bid (the "NCIB").</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The NCIB allows the Company to purchase up to $5 million aggregate principal amount of its 5.50% convertible unsecured subordinated debentures ("Convertible Debentures") (representing approximately 10% of its public float of $50 million aggregate principal amount of Convertible Debentures as of December 14, 2018), in each case, over a period of twelve months commencing on December 19, 2018. The NCIB will expire no later than December 18, 2019.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Under the NCIB, Convertible Debentures may be repurchased in open market transactions on the TSX, and/or alternative Canadian trading systems, or by such other means as may be permitted by the TSX and applicable securities laws and in accordance with the rules of the TSX governing NCIBs. The total number of Convertible Debentures that Cardinal is permitted to purchase is subject to a daily purchase limit of $6,000 aggregate principal amount of Convertible Debentures however, Cardinal may make one block purchase per calendar week which exceeds the daily repurchase restrictions. Any Convertible Debentures that are purchased under the NCIB will be cancelled upon their purchase by the Company.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Management of Cardinal believes that, from time to time, the market price of its Convertible Debentures may not fully reflect the underlying value of the Convertible Debentures and that at such times the purchase of Convertible Debentures would be in the best interests of Cardinal.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">* If oil prices exceed Gran Tierra's 2019 forecast, the resulting increase in cash flow2 may be directed to accelerated capital spending, and share buybacks under our previously announced Normal Course Issuer Bid and Automatic Securities Purchase Plan; alternatively, if oil prices drop significantly below the Company's forecast, Gran Tierra has the ability to moderate the rate of spending accordingly due to the Company's high operated interests across its asset portfolio</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">* Gran Tierra has significant flexibility with capital allocation and timing; the Company operates over 90% of its production, 13 out of its 14 blocks in the Putumayo Basin and all five of its blocks in the MMV</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">* Based on the midpoint of guidance, the base case 2019 capital budget is forecasted to be directed approximately 65% to development and 35% to exploration</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">* Approximately 30% of the 2019 development capital program is expected to be invested in facilities, with approximately 65% of this investment dedicated to the ongoing facilities expansion at the Acordionero field that is forecasted to increase its oil production capacity up to 30,000 bopd by end of second quarter 2019</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">* In the low case scenario, where the Brent oil price is assumed to average $55/bbl during 2019, the reduction in 2019 capital outlined above would not result in a material reduction in 2019 average production (approximately 250 boepd) Gran Tierra expects approximate 2019 expenses and operating netback5 to be in the following ranges:</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Gary Guidry, President and Chief Executive Officer of Gran Tierra, commented: "During 2018, we have continued to execute our strategy of delivering profitable organic production growth while reinvesting in exploration and appraisal of our diversified Colombian asset portfolio. In mid-December 2018, we crossed an important milestone with record Company production of 40,000 boepd. Our 2019 capital budget is a balanced returns-focused program, with a strong development component and a robust high-impact exploration and appraisal campaign. Our 2019 plans are expected to build on the operational momentum achieved by our team in 2018, to be fully funded from cash flow2 and to deliver the next phase of transformative production and reserves growth. With our 2019 expense budget, we are forecasting decreases in both our operating and general and administrative costs per boe compared to 2018.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Our MMV assets are expected to drive Gran Tierra's profitable growth in 2019. We plan to ramp up production at Acordionero and continue our appraisal of the Ayombero-Chuira field. At Acordionero, we expect to continuously drill both production and water injection wells throughout 2019 and beyond, while continuing to expand the current waterflood program for enhanced oil recovery. Acordionero's results to date have continued to exceed our original expectations when we acquired the field in 2016.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We are achieving success across the Putumayo Basin where we plan to further delineate our high potential Carbonate and N-Sandstone plays by continuing to drill a mix of exploration, appraisal and development wells. With the largest Putumayo landholdings of 1.1 million acres and seismic data base, we believe Gran Tierra is well positioned in the most prospective fairways of this proven, under-explored basin. We are fortunate to be operating in Colombia, with both the MMV and the Putumayo having sufficient infrastructure for us to monetize our current and future production based on the Brent world oil price.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We believe that Gran Tierra has a self-funding and sustainable business model with an excellent Colombian portfolio to generate ongoing material growth on a per share basis in terms of net asset value, production, reserves and cash flow."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This press release contains opinions, forecasts, projections, and other statements about future events or results that constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the United States Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and financial outlook and forward looking information within the meaning of applicable Canadian securities laws (collectively, “forward-looking statements”). All statements other than statements of historical facts included in this press release regarding our financial position, estimated quantities and net present value of reserves, business strategy, plans and objectives for future operations, capital spending plans and those statements preceded by, followed by or that otherwise include the words “believe”, “expect”, “intend”, “anticipate”, “forecast”, “budget”, “will”, “estimate”, “target”, “project”, “goal”, “plan”, “should”, "guidance" or similar expressions are forward-looking statements. Such forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, the Company’s capital budget amount and uses, drilling and capital program including the changes thereto along with the expected costs and the allocation of capital and drilling including trends, infrastructure schedules and the expected timing and drilling sequence of certain projects ; the Company's operations; future projected or target production and the growth of production including expectations respecting production growth, expected future net cash provided by operating activities (described in this press release as “cash flow”), free cash flow, net debt and certain associated metrics; our strategy regarding changing oil prices; expected cost savings; anticipated capital expenditures, including the location and impact of capital expenditures, the timing and amounts of potential share buybacks, timing of execution of and terms under the amended credit facility; our business strategies; our ability to grow in both the near and long term and the funding of our growth opportunities; the plans, objectives, expectations and intentions of the Company regarding production, exploration and exploration upside, development; and the future development of the Company's business. The forward-looking statements contained in this press release reflect several material factors and expectations and assumptions of Gran Tierra including, without limitation, that Gran Tierra will continue to conduct its operations in a manner consistent with its current expectations, the accuracy of testing and production results and seismic data, pricing and cost estimates (including with respect to commodity pricing and exchange rates), rig availability, the effects of drilling down-dip, the effects of waterflood and hydraulic stimulation operations, the extent and effect of delivery disruptions and the general continuance of current or, where applicable, assumed operational, regulatory and industry conditions including in areas of potential expansion, the receipt of approval from the ANH and the ability of Gran Tierra to execute its current business and operational plans in the manner currently planned. Gran Tierra believes the material factors, expectations and assumptions reflected in the forward-looking statements are reasonable at this time but no assurance can be given that these factors, expectations and assumptions will prove to be correct.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Among the important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated by the forward-looking statements in this press release are: sustained or future declines in commodity prices and potential resulting future impairments and reductions in proved reserve quantities and value; Gran Tierra’s operations are located in South America, and unexpected problems can arise due to guerrilla activity; technical difficulties and operational difficulties may arise which impact the production, transport or sale of our products; geographic, political and weather conditions can impact the production, transport or sale of our products; the risk that current global economic and credit conditions may impact oil prices and oil consumption more than Gran Tierra currently predicts; the ability of Gran Tierra to execute its business plan; the risk that unexpected delays and difficulties in developing currently owned properties may occur; the timely receipt of regulatory or other required approvals for our operating activities; the failure of exploratory drilling to result in commercial wells; unexpected delays due to the limited availability of drilling equipment and personnel; the risk that oil prices could continue to decline or be volatile, or current global economic and credit market conditions may impact current oil prices or expectations regarding future oil prices and oil consumption, which could cause Gran Tierra to further modify its strategy and capital spending program; and the risk factors detailed from time to time in Gran Tierra’s periodic reports filed with the <span class="companylink">Securities and Exchange Commission</span>, including, without limitation, under the caption “Risk Factors” in Gran Tierra's Annual Report on Form 10-K filed February 28, 2018 and its other filings with the SEC. These filings are available on the SEC website at http://www.sec.gov[http://www.sec.gov] and on SEDAR at http://www.sedar.com[http://www.sedar.com]. Although the current guidance, capital spending program and long term strategy of Gran Tierra are based upon the current expectations of the management of Gran Tierra, should any one of a number of issues arise, Gran Tierra may find it necessary to alter its business strategy and/or capital spending program and there can be no assurance as at the date of this press release as to how those funds may be reallocated or strategy changed and how that would impact Gran Tierra's results of operations and financing position.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">All forward-looking statements are made as of the date of this press release and the fact that this press release remains available does not constitute a representation by Gran Tierra that Gran Tierra believes these forward-looking statements continue to be true as of any subsequent date. Actual results may vary materially from the expected results expressed in forward-looking statements. Gran Tierra disclaims any intention or obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as expressly required by applicable securities laws. Gran Tierra’s forward-looking statements are expressly qualified in their entirety by this cautionary statement.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The estimates of future production, net cash provided by operating activities (described in this press release as “cash flow"), free cash flow, net debt, working capital and certain expenses may be considered to be future-oriented financial information or a financial outlook for the purposes of applicable Canadian securities laws. Financial outlook and future-oriented financial information contained in this press release about prospective financial performance, financial position or cash flows are based on assumptions about future events, including economic conditions and proposed courses of action, based on management’s assessment of the relevant information currently available, and to become available in the future. In particular, this press release contains projected operational and financial information for 2019. These projections contain forward-looking statements and are based on a number of material assumptions and factors set out above. Actual results may differ significantly from the projections presented herein. The actual results of Gran Tierra’s operations for any period could vary from the amounts set forth in these projections, and such variations may be material. See above for a discussion of the risks that could cause actual results to vary. The future-oriented financial information and financial outlooks contained in this press release have been approved by management as of the date of this press release. Readers are cautioned that any such financial outlook and future-oriented financial information contained herein should not be used for purposes other than those for which it is disclosed herein. The Company and its management believe that the prospective financial information has been prepared on a reasonable basis, reflecting management’s best estimates and judgments, and represent, to the best of management’s knowledge and opinion, the Company’s expected course of action. However, because this information is highly subjective, it should not be relied on as necessarily indicative of future results.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Oil and Gas Disclaimer</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">BOEs have been converted on the basis of 6 thousand cubic feet ("Mcf") of natural gas to 1 bbl of oil. BOEs may be misleading, particularly if used in isolation. A BOE conversion ratio of 6 Mcf: 1 bbl is based on an energy equivalency conversion method primarily applicable at the burner tip and does not represent a value equivalency at the wellhead. In addition, given that the value ratio based on the current price of oil as compared with natural gas is significantly different from the energy equivalent of six to one, utilizing a BOE conversion ratio of 6 Mcf: 1 bbl would be misleading as an indication of value.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This press release contains certain oil and gas metrics, including operating netback, which do not have standardized meanings or standard methods of calculation and therefore such measures may not be comparable to similar measures used by other companies and should not be used to make comparisons. Such metrics have been included herein to provide readers with additional measures to evaluate the Company's performance; however, such measures are not reliable indicators of the future performance of the Company and future performance may not compare to the performance in previous periods</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">References to thickness of “oil pay” or of a formation where evidence of hydrocarbons has been encountered is not necessarily an indicator that hydrocarbons will be recoverable in commercial quantities or in any estimated volume. Well test results should be considered as preliminary and not necessarily indicative of long-term performance or of ultimate recovery. Well log interpretations indicating oil and gas accumulations are not necessarily indicative of future production or ultimate recovery. If it is indicated that a pressure transient analysis or well-test interpretation has not been carried out, any data disclosed in that respect should be considered preliminary until such analysis has been completed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Non-GAAP Measures</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This press release includes forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures as further described herein. These non-GAAP measures do not have a standardized meaning under GAAP. Investors are cautioned that these measures should not be construed as an alternative to net income or loss or other measures of financial performance as determined in accordance with GAAP. Gran Tierra's method of calculating these measures may differ from other companies and, accordingly, it may not be comparable to similar measures used by other companies. These non-GAAP financial measures are presented along with the corresponding GAAP measure so as to not imply that more emphasis should be placed on the non-GAAP measure.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Operating netback as presented is defined as oil and gas sales less operating and transportation expenses. Management believes that operating netback is a useful supplemental measure for management and investors to analyze financial performance and provides an indication of the results generated by our principal business activities prior to the consideration of other income and expenses. Gran Tierra is unable to provide a quantitative reconciliation of forward-looking operating netback to its most directly comparable forward-looking GAAP measure because management cannot reliably predict certain of the necessary components of such forward-looking GAAP measure.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Free cash flow as presented is defined as GAAP “net cash provided by operating activities” less projected 2019 capital spending. Management believes that free cash flow is a useful supplemental measure for management and investors to in order to evaluate the financial sustainability of the Company's business. Gran Tierra is unable to provide a quantitative reconciliation of forward-looking free cash flow to its most directly comparable forward-looking GAAP measure because management cannot reliably predict certain of the necessary components of such forward-looking GAAP measure.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CALGARY, Alberta, Dec. 17, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- <span class="companylink">Baytex Energy Corp</span>. (“Baytex”) (TSX, NYSE: BTE) announces that its Board of Directors has approved a 2019 capital budget of $550 to $650 million, which is designed to generate average annual production of 93,000 to 97,000 boe/d.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Commenting on the announcement, Ed LaFehr, President and Chief Executive Officer, said: “As we enter 2019, our top priority is disciplined capital allocation across our strong portfolio of assets. We will focus activity on our high return, high netback light oil assets in the Viking and Eagle Ford and we will continue to prudently advance the East Duvernay Shale. Importantly, we have the operational flexibility to adjust our spending plans based on changes in the commodity price environment.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Highlights of the 2019 Budget</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">* Funding of Capital Program. We are targeting 2019 capital expenditures to approximate adjusted funds flow (assumes a WTI price of US$52/bbl).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">* Capital Allocation. Approximately 80% of our capital development program will be directed to our high netback light oil assets in the Eagle Ford and Viking. Approximately 10% of our capital will be directed to the East Duvernay Shale as we build on our success in this light oil resource play.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">* Stable Production. With a deep inventory of development projects, we target a long-term production growth rate of 5-10%. In the current commodity price environment, we believe it is prudent to deliver a cash flow budget that is designed to deliver stable production.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">* Oil Price Diversification. Over 90% of our operating netback is expected to come from our light oil assets in the Eagle Ford and Viking. Our light oil and condensate production in the Eagle Ford commands premium Louisiana Light Sweet (“LLS”) based pricing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">* Free Cash Flow. Adjusted funds flow in excess of capital expenditures, lease payments and asset retirement obligations will be allocated to debt repayment. A US$1.00/bbl change in the price of WTI impacts our annual adjusted funds flow by approximately $30 million on an unhedged basis ($24 million on a hedged basis). The 2019 program is approximately 45% weighted to the first half of the year and we have the operational flexibility to adjust our spending plans based on changes in commodity prices. The budget is 90% weighted to drilling and completion activities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Based on the mid-point of our guidance range of 95,000 boe/d, approximately 62% of our production is in Canada with the remaining 38% in the Eagle Ford. Our production mix is forecast to be 83% liquids (46% light oil and condensate, 27% heavy oil and 10% natural gas liquids) and 17% natural gas, based on a 6:1 natural gas-to-oil equivalency.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Canada</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Canada, our development activity will largely be focused on the Viking, where we expect to invest approximately 45% of our capital in this shallow, light oil resource play (approximately 36° API) where we control 460 net sections of prospective lands. Our program anticipates drilling approximately 245 net wells (85% extended reach horizontals) in 2019.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We will continue to prudently advance the evaluation of the East Duvernay Shale, an early stage, high netback light oil resource play where we have amassed over 430 sections of land. Our initial focus has been to delineate and evaluate the potential depth of this light oil resource. We now have five producing wells in the Pembina area. The two most recent wells brought on-stream in late November are currently producing in excess of 400 bbl/d of light oil per well. These new wells are consistent with the strong results achieved from our first three wells in the Pembina area. Approximately 10% of our planned capital investment in 2019 will be directed to the Pembina area where we expect to drill 6-8 net wells.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We expect a modest heavy oil development program through the first half of 2019, with the potential to scale activity higher should crude oil prices improve. At Peace River, we will drill several stratigraphic wells as we continue to delineate our lands and expand our future drilling inventory. Our 2019 guidance assumes the curtailment of approximately 1,000 bbl/d of heavy oil for the first six months of the year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Eagle Ford</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Our Eagle Ford asset in South Texas is one of the <span class="companylink">premier oil</span> resource plays in North America. The asset generates a strong operating netback and free cash flow and contains a significant inventory of development prospects.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Approximately 33% of our planned capital investment will be directed to the Eagle Ford where we expect to bring approximately 30 net wells on production. Development will be concentrated in the Lower Eagle Ford formation across our four areas of mutual interest.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As part of our normal operations, we are exposed to movements in commodity prices. In an effort to manage these exposures, we utilize various financial derivative contracts, crude-by-rail and capital allocation optimization to reduce the volatility in our adjusted funds flow.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For 2019, we have entered into hedges on approximately 30% of our net crude oil exposure. This includes 25% of our net WTI exposure with 2% fixed at US$62.85/bbl and 23% hedged utilizing a 3-way option structure that provides a US$10/bbl premium to WTI when WTI is at or below US$56.02/bbl and allows upside participation to US$73.65/bbl. In addition, we have entered into a Brent-based 3-way option structure for 3,000 bbl/d that provides a US$10/bbl premium to Brent when Brent is at or below US$59.50/bbl and allows upside participation to US$78.68/bbl. We have also entered into hedges on approximately 21% of our net natural gas exposure through a combination of AECO swaps at C$2.37/mcf and <span class="companylink">NYMEX</span> swaps at US$3.09/mmbtu.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Crude-by-rail is an integral part of our egress and marketing strategy. For 2019, we expect to deliver 11,000 bbl/d (approximately 40%) of our heavy oil volumes to market by rail, up from approximately 9,000 bbl/d in 2018. Commencing January 1, 2019, approximately 70% of our crude by rail commitments are WTI based contracts with no WCS pricing exposure.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">All amounts in this press release are stated in Canadian dollars unless otherwise specified.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Non-GAAP Financial Measures</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Adjusted funds flow is not a measurement based on generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP") in Canada, but is a financial term commonly used in the oil and gas industry. We define adjusted funds flow as cash flow from operating activities adjusted for changes in non-cash operating working capital and asset retirement obligations settled. Our determination of adjusted funds flow may not be comparable to other issuers. We consider adjusted funds flow a key measure of performance as it demonstrates our ability to generate the cash flow necessary to fund capital investments, debt repayment, payments on our lease obligations, settlement of our abandonment obligations and potential future dividends. In addition, we use the ratio of net debt to adjusted funds flow to manage our capital structure. We eliminate changes in non-cash working capital and settlements of abandonment obligations from cash flow from operations as the amounts can be discretionary and may vary from period to period depending on our capital programs and the maturity of our operating areas. The settlement of abandonment obligations are managed with our capital budgeting process which considers available adjusted funds flow. The most directly comparable measures calculated in accordance with GAAP are cash flow from operating activities and net income.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Free cash flow is not a measurement based on GAAP in Canada. We define free cash flow as adjusted funds flow less sustaining capital. Sustaining capital is an estimate of the amount of exploration and development capital required to offset production declines on an annual basis and maintain flat production volumes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Operating netback is not a measurement based on GAAP in Canada, but is a financial term commonly used in the oil and gas industry. Operating netback is equal to petroleum and natural gas sales less blending expense, royalties, production and operating expense and transportation expense divided by barrels of oil equivalent sales volume for the applicable period. Our determination of operating netback may not be comparable with the calculation of similar measures for other entities. We believe that this measure assists in characterizing our ability to generate cash margin on a unit of production basis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Advisory Regarding Oil and Gas Information</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Where applicable, oil equivalent amounts have been calculated using a conversion rate of six thousand cubic feet of natural gas to one barrel of oil. The use of boe amounts may be misleading, particularly if used in isolation. A boe conversion ratio of six thousand cubic feet of natural gas to one barrel of oil is based on an energy equivalency conversion method primarily applicable at the burner tip and does not represent a value equivalency at the wellhead.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MONTREAL -- Quebec's premier is quick to reject "dirty" oil from Western Canada in favour of hydro power, but new data indicates the province's citizens are buying record amounts of gasoline, and purchasing trucks and bigger homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Quebecers are widely seen in Canada as environmentally conscious, but per capita, they are some of the highest consumers of energy on the planet, according to a report prepared by researchers at <span class="companylink">Université de Montréal</span>'s business school.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Premier François Legault recently provoked the ire of western Canadians when he reminded journalists how there was "no social acceptability" in his province for a "dirty energy" pipeline from Alberta.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">His comments drew rebukes from pundits and western leaders, such as Alberta Premier Rachel Notley, who said Legault "needs to get off his high horse."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prof. Pierre-Olivier Pineau, co-author of the report on energy use in Quebec, said people have a point when they criticize the province for its public stance on fossil fuels compared to the behaviours of its citizens.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Yes, there is a certain degree of hypocrisy in all humans, and obviously, with regards to certain positions that Quebecers take (on energy), there is some hypocrisy there," Pineau said in an interview.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Quebecers do have some bragging rights, however, when it comes to green living, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Per-capita carbon emissions in Quebec are the lowest in the country, Pineau said, and overall emissions have fallen by 11 per cent since 1990.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But that success is attributed less to choice and more to circumstance, he explained.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"One hundred per cent of electricity in Quebec is from renewable resources," he said. "Also, Quebecers are less rich than other Canadians, meaning they consume less energy, have less cars."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the automobiles Quebecers do drive are increasingly gas-guzzlers, the report says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of vehicles such as SUVs and pickups in Quebec rose by 246 per cent between 1990 and 2017, and gasoline sales jumped 33 per cent during the same period. Every year since 2015, sales of such vehicles have overtaken car sales.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Among the 3.7 million Quebecers who had a job in 2016 and who worked away from home, 78 per cent said they primarily used a personal vehicle to get there," the report noted.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It also indicated that between 1990 and 2016, the average surface area of a home in the province increased by 17 per cent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Moreover, on a per-capita basis, Quebecers consume significantly more energy than the global average and almost as much as in the United States.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While Pineau's report suggests Quebecers should boast less about their green credentials, it also slays a common line of attack against the province.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Following Legault's "dirty" oil comments, news organizations and social media platforms were filled with comments about Quebec's hypocrisy for accepting foreign oil from human rights-abusing countries while rejecting western energy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The report, however, indicates that as of June 2018, 94 per cent of oil in Quebec came either from the U.S. or Canada.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What was the death knell for <span class="companylink">Bombardier Transportation</span> (BT), the rail division of <span class="companylink">Bombardier Inc</span>.?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Was it the 2017 decision by New York's <span class="companylink">Metropolitan Transportation Authority</span> to disqualify BT from even bidding on a landmark contract for as many as 1,800 rail cars? Was it the 2017 decisions in Bombardier's home Canadian market by the transit systems of Montreal and Toronto to order their next-gen rail cars from China Railway Rolling Stock Corp. (CRRC) and</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">France's <span class="companylink">Alstom SA</span>, respectively?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Or, finally, was it the decision announced last week by Via Rail, yet another firm in Bombardier's home country, to award a $1-billion contract for railcars to Germany's <span class="companylink">Siemens AG</span>?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There have been many such setbacks at BT.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Always, BT's record of unreliability in delivering glitch-free products on time is why it loses contracts. And each setback also costs BT lucrative after-sales service contracts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">You could say that it's time for Bombardier to shed its arrogant incompetence (problems with faulty BT equipment are usually the buyer's fault, in BT's view), now that archrivals <span class="companylink">Siemens</span> and <span class="companylink">Alstom</span> are merging, with combined global market share more than twice that of BT's approximately 4 per cent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And BT has no realistic hope of holding off Chinese state-owned industry leader CRRC ( 13 per cent market share), a growing threat to BT in North America, where it already has planted its flag in Montreal, Chicago, Boston and Philadelphia.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">You could say that.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But, as a still-bloated <span class="companylink">General Motors Co</span>. has shown us in waking up one morning with the realization it needed to shutter seven North American plants including GM Oshawa, entrenched cultures of arrogant complacency that are decades in the making usually end only with liquidation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Canada's resilient banks</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Two warnings last week of economic turbulence ahead should be assessed in a larger, favourable context.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The federal banking regulator last week ordered Canadian banks to tighten their lending standards, ahead of a possible economic slowdown in 2019 and a resulting rise in loan losses. And <span class="companylink">Citigroup Inc</span>. warned of a possible "debt crisis" for Canada and, indeed, the world, over the next three years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Consider, though, that three years is a long time, and that at least some of the troubles currently besetting the world are temporary. To wit, trade wars, Brexit, slumping commodity prices, the easing in China's once-torrid GDP growth rate, and geopolitical instability ranging from Russian adventurism to severe economic distress in major economies such as Brazil.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the trade wars will abate, since there are only losers on all sides.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Europe's economic crisis is waning. Brexit will resolve itself, perhaps not in ideal fashion but with the crippling uncertainly removed. Lower oil prices benefit emerging economies. China's GDP is poised for a modest uptick, and Japan has just recorded its second-longest postwar stretch of GDP growth uninterrupted by recession. Add in continued U.S. buoyancy, and the world's three biggest economies are robust.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Canada's Big Six banks have bolstered their reserves to withstand above-average loan losses. Should those occur, the "contagion" we're warned of - a jump in Alberta loan losses spreading elsewhere - is unlikely. For instance, Quebec's much larger economy is posting unusually strong growth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Preparing for the worst is wise. But there is such a thing as the Cassandra who has predicted seven of the last two downturns. This probably isn't a time to go long on pessimism.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Making the internet safe</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Tim Berners-Lee, who invented the World Wide Web in 1990, is waging a campaign to enable us to be online "freely, safely and without fear."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So far, more than 50 organizations have signed up for his mission to create a "Magna Carta for the web," rules of proper conduct devised by governments, business and individuals, who then adhere to them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ahead of the Magna Carta's scheduled publication in May 2019, you can monitor its development at Berners-Lee's <span class="companylink">World Wide Web Foundation</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Among the early signatories to the Magna Carta project are <span class="companylink">Facebook Inc</span>. and <span class="companylink">Google Inc</span>. It only makes sense that these two firms, which dominate what was intended to be a public commons, be at the table.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The event was organized by the pro-oilsands groups Oilfield Dads and Rally4Resources, which say government regulations are suffocating the Canadian oil and gas industry.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Grande Prairie is a hub for oil production in northwestern Alberta, known as Peace Country. Like the rest of the province, it has felt the pinch as the province's oil industry struggles from a price differential that's in part due to a lack of capacity to transport its oil to markets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many who attended Sunday's rally held signs denouncing the federal government's Bill C-69 to revamp the <span class="companylink">National Energy Board</span>, which opponents say will make it impossible to build new pipelines.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">RCMP estimated more than 1,500 people attended the rally. Afterward, a convoy of over 600 vehicles drove through the city with their horns blasting.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Alberta's Economic Development and Trade Minister Deron Bilous, who spoke at the event, slammed the federal government for not doing more to help.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There is not a road, a bridge or hospital that does not owe something to the Alberta energy sector and we need the prime minister to wake up to that," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bilous also made a dig at a recent call by the council of Whistler, B.C. for the oil industry to share in covering the costs associated with climate change.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The people of Whistler need to tell the truth: that they are using Alberta gas for their cars for their petrochemical products, and they're using our oil and it's time to smarten up," he told the rally.</p>

</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Canadian energy industry matters to all Canadians. It is complex and interconnected to all other sectors of our broad economy. No matter where you live, we are all affected. We succeed together in times of prosperity through national economic support and growth. We struggle together in times of challenge.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Amid recent headlines such as “Alberta in Crisis" or “Canadian Oil Selling for Cheapest in the World," heated and polarizing debate regarding pipelines continues to grow. We seem to focus not on what we share as proud Canadians, but on what makes us different. I am hopeful that, together, we can change that.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I am proud of our industry, the companies I have worked for, ranging from a multinational to the small, private Alberta-based oil company that I run today. Most importantly, I am proud of the people, families and communities our industry supports across Canada.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For context, let me tell you a little about our company and its people. As entrepreneurs, my partners and I started the company in 2014, investing significant portions of our retirement savings alongside our investors. Since inception, we have collectively injected half-a-billion dollars into the economy through investment, a large portion being muchneeded foreign capital. Just this past summer, we purchased a private company from a U.S.-based private equity firm. We produce conventional light oil, equivalent to the familiar West Texas intermediate (WTI).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pipelines offer us the safest and most economic way to get our product to market. Pipeline constraints have affected all oil prices, light oil included. Although the recent Alberta government's mandated production cuts are now showing positive signs, this is only a short-term solution.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Without adequate safe and reliable market access through additional pipelines, capital investment in this industry and ultimately in Canada, will suffer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So far, we've treated the symptom but not the underlying disease, which is a lack of pipeline capacity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In response to the immediate pricing crisis, our company faced the difficult decision to defer investing additional capital, primarily through the suspension of our drilling program. We released two drilling rigs in late November. We estimate that this put more than 400 people out of work, right before Christmas and with very little notice. Both rig crews, whose members hail from hometowns from Ontario to British Columbia, were performing exceptionally well, reflecting their skill and dedication. Additionally, we have significantly reduced our capital investment budget for next year and have curtailed production.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In any given year, our business relies on more than 1,500 separate companies from all over Canada, employing thousands of Canadians, from steel manufacturers through to local truck drivers and heavy equipment operators. The reduction of our operations will have widespread economic ripples. Royalty payments to the province will shrink at a time when we continue to experience historically high provincial deficits. Nationally, this will imply smaller transfer payments to other provinces as well. This will translate into a reduced ability to fund education, health care and social services.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although our own situation is naturally heartbreaking to us, this current state reflects the economic landscape that thousands of companies and individuals face in Alberta today.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Recently, The Globe and Mail ran a feature on the challenge of inactive wells in Western Canada. With our recent acquisition, our company inherited a large obligation for abandonment and reclamation, with some wells dating back to the 1940s.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite the current economic challenges, we remain committed to a pro-active and timely reclamation of these legacy wells and will invest tens of millions of dollars over the next few years to assist remediation efforts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Our company story is not unique. The Canadian energy industry is a global leader in actions, not rhetoric. I am proud of its commitment and track record of continuous improvement in all facets, including environmental performance, contributions to local communities, mutually beneficial working relationships with First Nations, and protecting the health and safety of our workers and contractors every hour of every day.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We do not look for pity, bailouts or handouts. Rather, we ask simply for genuine appreciation, compassion and support for our contribution to the Confederation from our government and fellow citizens. And please don't lose sight of the hardship of workers and their families who are affected here and now. Like those crews, of Trinidad Rig No. 32 and Savannah Rig No. 617, whom we recently had to let go.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As Canadians, we owe ourselves a better conversation. To Canadians of all political stripes: Please take time to hear and see the real-life commitment and enormous progress that our industry has made toward sustainable development. Please get informed and engaged in a topic that affects us all. We need to hear your voices of support. Our collective losses are mounting, not just in dollars but in people terms.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I think I can speak for my energy industry colleagues about our passion to play a constructive role to help our country and future generations thrive. We may have different experiences, backgrounds and beliefs, but I am confident that we share a love for our country and a commitment to the future.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Here are some truths that urgently require a co-ordinated response from governments, companies and Canadians whose jobs, incomes and living standards are jeopardized by ignoring them: First, that the natural-resource sectors (agriculture, energy, mining, forestry and fisheries) are foundational to the Canadian economy, directly and indirectly accounting for over 20 per cent of our gross national product, with the energy sector being the biggest contributor.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Secondly, Canada is losing millions of dollars a day in revenues, plus thousands of jobs and billions of dollars in investment, because opposition to the building of pipelines to seaboard and world markets forces Canada to sell oil and natural gas to the U.S.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">market at discounted prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As the second-largest country on Earth by area, Canada has roughly the second-largest store of natural resources in the world – something to be immensely proud, not apologetic, about.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Canada is also bounded by three oceans, thus requiring clear and unobstructed corridors to move a major portion of our natural resources to seaboard (and thus to overseas markets) by road, railway, pipeline and transmission lines. The immediate requirements are for corridors to the Pacific to access Asian markets and corridors to the Atlantic to replace oil imports from Saudi Arabia and Venezuela with Canadian oil. As more resource development moves further northward, corridors to the Arctic will also be required.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the macro level, these corridors should be preapproved by the federal and provincial governments, meaning the route and its dimensions are established by regulation or legislation and won't need to be constantly readjudicated. This would eliminate much of the regulatory and political gridlock which has so far paralyzed Canada's ability to provide needed national infrastructure. Such infrastructure should also be required to satisfy pre-established criteria pertaining to efficiency, safety and environmental protection.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the case of pipelines and electricity-transmission lines, the issue of contract carriers against common carriers (such as roadways and rail lines) will also have to be resolved.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Most importantly, the creation and maintenance of these corridors requires a 21st-century political and economic effort equivalent to the 19th-century effort to create Canadian Confederation and build the original <span class="companylink">Canadian Pacific Railway</span> – what Pierre Berton called The National Dream.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Just as the creation of Confederation and the CPR required a uniting of pre-Confederation political and economic interests to achieve those nationalistic objectives, today we need what might be called “the Corridors Coalition" consisting of governments, companies and citizens dedicated to creating and maintaining the corridors described above.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the provincial level, the NDP government in Alberta is likely to be replaced by a more effective and market-savvy conservative administration in the spring of 2019. That new government could find sympathetic coalition partners in the conservative governments of Saskatchewan, Manitoba, Ontario, New Brunswick and, with the right approach, Quebec.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Such a coalition would then need to expand into a public -private partnership involving resource companies and infrastructure builders capable of getting the required corridors financed, built and operating as quickly as possible.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Most importantly, it will be essential for the coalition to broaden its base to include public and interest-group participation – including those Indigenous and environmental groups supportive of responsible resource development. This would be essential to give the coalition and its public supporters the political clout necessary to positively influence, or achieve the replacement of, recalcitrant governments such as the Justin Trudeau government in Ottawa and the John Horgan government in British Columbia.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If the key elements of the “Corridors Coalition" were to be assembled by mid-2019, it could offer a clear and powerful challenge to the federal political parties contesting the 2019 federal election in the fall, by posing the following question: “Which of you are prepared to unequivocally commit the constitutional, regulatory and financial support of the federal government to the immediate creation and maintenance of the Pacific and Atlantic corridors?" How the federal political leaders, parties and candidates respond to this demand should be a central issue of the 2019 federal election.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Finally, the creation and success of the “Corridors Coalition" will be of more than domestic significance. The world will be watching to see whether a Western democracy such as Canada with a market-driven economy can build and manage the development of major infrastructure corridors and facilities with speed and efficiency while still genuinely respecting human rights and the need for environmental protection.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This, in comparison with the speed and efficiency with which the Communist government of China, can build and manage its state-directed Silk Road and Economic Belt projects while generally disregarding human rights and environmental considerations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This is the 21st-century ideological contest that the Western democracies with market-driven economies must win.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Canada has a chance to show that it can be done.</p>

It has subsequently advanced into the current drilling schedule and commenced drilling in early December. The M-10 twin is anticipated to produce oil although it is structurally lower in the pool. If the well encounters water it will be converted to a water injection well to provide pressure support for the M pool.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In North West Gharib (“NWG”), the NWG 38A-7 was completed (unstimulated) in the main Red Bed formation and confirmed the presence of oil. NWG 38A-7 was placed on production in late November and is currently producing 360 Bopd. The NWG 38A-7 well has extended the known oil column height structurally down an additional 101 feet to a total of 445 feet for the NWG 38 pool, which should increase the reserves assigned to the NWG 38 pool in 2018. Based on the results of NWG 38A-7, the Company has commenced wellsite construction at NWG 38A-8, located approximately 0.4 km south of NWG 38A-7 which is targeting the Red Bed pool to potentially provide water injection/reservoir pressure support for the 38A pool. NWG 38A-8 is scheduled for drilling following the M-10 twin well.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Canada, the Company completed the 2018 Cardium development program, which included six gross (five net) horizontal Cardium development wells drilled from a common pad to improve efficiencies and reduce costs. The Company drilled and completed five one-mile horizontal wells and the Company’s first two-mile horizontal well. The wells were fracture stimulated during November and December and are being equipped to produce by year end. In addition, the Company completed construction of a new oil gathering pipeline during the quarter to connect the new multi-well pad and two existing producers to the Company’s main oil processing facility to reduce trucking in the community and associated operating expenses.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Oil and Gas Advisories</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Mr. Brett Norris, M.Sc., P <span class="companylink">Geo</span>, - Vice President Exploration for <span class="companylink">TransGlobe Energy Corporation</span>, and a qualified person as defined in the Guidance Note for Mining, Oil and Gas Companies, June 2009, of the <span class="companylink">London Stock Exchange</span>, has reviewed and approved the technical information contained in this announcement. Mr. Norris obtained a Master’s of Science Degree in Geology from the <span class="companylink">University of Western Ontario</span>. He is a Registered Professional Geoscientist in the province of Alberta and has over 30 years’ experience in oil and gas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">BOEs may be misleading, particularly if used in isolation. A BOE conversion ratio of six thousand cubic feet of natural gas to one barrel of oil equivalent (6 mcf: 1 bbl) is based on an energy equivalency conversion method primarily applicable at the burner tip and does not represent a value equivalency at the wellhead. Given that the value ratio based on the current price of crude oil as compared to natural gas is significantly different from the energy equivalency of 6:1, utilizing a conversion on a 6:1 basis may be misleading as an indication of value.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">References in this press release to production test rates, are useful in confirming the presence of hydrocarbons, however such rates are not determinative of the rates at which such wells will commence production and decline thereafter and are not indicative of long term performance or of ultimate recovery. While encouraging, readers are cautioned not to place reliance on such rates in calculating the aggregate production for TransGlobe. A pressure transient analysis or well-test interpretation has not been carried out in respect of all wells. Accordingly, the Company cautions that the production test results should be considered to be preliminary.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Certain type curve information included to in this news release, including IP30, represents estimates of the production decline and ultimate volumes expected to be recovered from wells over the life of the well. This information is based on management-generated type curves based on a combination of historical performance of older wells and management's expectation of what might be achieved from future wells. The information represents what management thinks an average well will achieve. Individual wells may be higher or lower but over a larger number of wells management expects the average to come out to the type curve. Over time type curves can and will change based on achieving more production history on older wells or more recent completion information on newer wells.</p>

Prof. Pierre-Olivier Pineau, co-author of the report on energy use in Quebec, said people have a point when they criticize the province for its public stance on fossil fuels compared to the behaviours of its citizens.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Yes, there is a certain degree of hypocrisy in all humans, and obviously, with regards to certain positions that Quebecers take (on energy), there is some hypocrisy there." Pineau said in an interview.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Quebecers do have some bragging rights, however, when it comes to green living, he explained.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Per capita carbon emissions in Quebec are the lowest in the country, Pineau said, and the province has decreased its overall emissions by 11 per cent since 1990.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But that success is less attributed to choice and more to circumstance, Pineau explained.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"One hundred per cent of electricity in Quebec is from renewable resources," he said. "Also, Quebecers are less rich than other Canadians, meaning they consume less energy, have less cars."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the automobiles Quebecers do drive are increasingly gas-guzzling, according his report.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of vehicles such as trucks, SUVs and pickups in Quebec increased by 246 per cent between 1990 and 2017 and gasoline sales jumped 33 per cent during the same period.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since 2015, Enbridge's Line 9B pipeline reversal has helped ensure that 53 per cent of the oil consumed in Quebec comes from Western Canada — compared to roughly 10 per cent in 2014.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The rhetoric from Quebec leaders and activists, as well as the policies of the federal government, are alienating western Canadians, said Maxime Bernier, leader of the People's Party of Canada.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bernier, who quit the Conservative party to start his own last September, said Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's inability to get a pipeline built is contributing to the deep discount of Canadian oil sales and frustration among citizens in the West.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CALGARY—Don't like oil or beef? Albertans may steer clear.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Whenever Alberta's economy is criticized or questioned, Albertans — and even the provincial government — sometimes call for boycotts as a rebuke.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They're hardly a made-in-Alberta strategy, having been used for everything from advancing civil rights in 1960s America, to impoverishing the Jewish community in 1930s Nazi Germany.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But in Alberta, they appear to see heavy use whenever the province's main economic engines — oil and gas, and beef — or equalization payments come under fire. In recent weeks, <span class="companylink">Lush Cosmetics</span> has found itself in the crosshairs for its long-standing opposition to the oil industry.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's unclear whether Alberta sees more boycott movements than other provinces. Melanee Thomas, an associate professor at the University of Calgary's department of political science, suggests Albertans aren't as drawn to political consumerism — the act of avoiding or selecting certain products based on one's political values — as other regions. When they are, she wrote in an email, “it's often a small number of voices being loud over something they perceive as being existential to their identity.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">However, it's not inherently surprising that some Albertans — even a small number of voices — take criticism of the oil and beef industries seriously. A paper co-authored by David Finch, associate director of the Institute for Innovation and Entrepreneurship at Mount Royal University, suggests the physical proximity Albertans have to these industries means they're far more likely to have strong opinions on them — good or bad. In other words, those with strong environmentalist views who live near the patch might have stronger feelings about pollution or environmental degradation, while those employed in the industry are more likely to have stronger feelings about its continued success.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's difficult to determine the size and scope of boycotts, especially those co-ordinated online. Not all of the following boycotts have necessarily proven successful, or even gone beyond a couple of dozen angry social media posts, but they have certainly generated discussion — and even forced a provincial government to change its tune:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">Tim Hortons</span> — oil</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When a corporate accountability organization called <span class="companylink">SumOfUs</span> presented <span class="companylink">Tim Hortons</span> with a petition of 28,000 signatures calling for it to pull a series of Enbridge ads from their in-house TV channel, it sparked an uproar. The hashtag #BoycottTims hit No. 1 on <span class="companylink">Twitter</span> coast-to-coast in June 2015, and found very fertile ground in Alberta. A handful of protesters showed up at a <span class="companylink">Tim Hortons</span> location in downtown Calgary to complain about the company's removal of the ads, organized in part by Rebel Media, a far-right website run by Ezra Levant. Several notable Alberta politicians, such as then-Wildrose leader Brian Jean and then-Calgary Centre-North MP Michelle Rempel, also vowed to avoid double-doubles in protest.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But did it have an impact? Not particularly. Tim's never reinstated Enbridge's ads, and Albertans continue to buy their Timmies. But the company did say a month after the boycott it was reviewing whether it was worth having Tims TV screens in the first place.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Earls Restaurants — beef</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Western Canadians, and Albertans in particular, had a bone to pick with the restaurant chain after it moved in April 2016 to only serve beef raised without antibiotics, hormones, or steroids — and claimed there wasn't enough of this sort of beef in Canada to meet its demand. The company promised to “revisit our suppliers” if this ever changed in the future, but some Albertans were furious, taking to social media and calling on the company to switch back.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Just a month after the outrage began, Earls backed down.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We made a mistake,” said president Mo Jessa in a video statement. “We should have worked with local ranchers to find product that met our criteria.” He promised Earls would do everything in its power to find these local Canadian beef producers and — roughly a month later — the company announced it would be putting Canadian beef back on the menu at its Alberta and Saskatchewan locations, following a series of meetings with Canadian ranchers and beef suppliers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">k.d. lang — beef</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Grammy-winning singer-songwriter k.d. lang grew up in Alberta cattle country, but decided to take a stand against the industry. In 1990, she became the face for PETA's “Meat Stinks” campaign, in a commercial paid for by the animal rights organization. Folks living in North America's cowlands expressed their outrage, but it went beyond just avoiding her records. The <span class="companylink">Washington Post</span> reported that numerous radio stations in Alberta and the American Midwest, refused to play her music. A sign outside her hometown of Consort, Alta., proclaiming it the “Home of k.d. lang”, was even burned to the ground.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Her stance on the meat industry may have lost her some fans in cow country, including Alberta, but lang has held onto her vegetarianism.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">B.C. wine — oil</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Putting a cork in British Columbian wine imports last February came at the behest of the provincial government itself. Premier Rachel Notley announced the ban in retaliation for a pledge by B.C. Premier John Horgan to reject increased levels of oil through the existing Trans Mountain pipeline until B.C. reviewed spill safety measures. At a news conference, Notley admitted she enjoyed a glass of West Coast wine from time to time, but said the move was necessary to put pressure on the B.C. government.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It certainly impacted B.C. wine producers, many of whom depend on wines sales in Alberta. On Feb. 21 — two weeks after Notley's announcement — the B.C. Wine Institute sought a court injunction against the <span class="companylink">Alberta Gaming, Liquor and Cannabis Commission</span> for the ban, calling it unconstitutional. But the ban was short-lived.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The very next day, Horgan said he would not proceed with proposed regulatory restrictions to the increased flow of oil through B.C., and Notley duly suspended the ban. She claimed to reporters at the time that “in a small way today, B.C. blinked.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Neil Young and Jann Arden — oil</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rare is the singer-songwriter who supports oil and gas, and Neil Young is no exception. He has described oil pipelines and their surrounding issues as “scabs on our lives.” In 2013, he compared the Fort McMurray oilsands to the rubble of Hiroshima, after it was struck by an atomic bomb in 1945. In early 2014, he held a series of benefit concerts — including one in Calgary — for the Athabasca Chipewyan First Nation who was fighting oilsands development.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This tour didn't sit well with some Albertans — or the office of then-Prime Minister Stephen Harper — but no concerted boycott action took place aside from some angry social media commentary and the creation of a relatively sparse “Boycott Neil Young Concerts” page on <span class="companylink">Facebook</span>. It's unclear whether anger over Young's comments affected how much money he raised for the benefit tour.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">However, four years later, a similar situation involving Jann Arden provoked Oil Sands Strong, a pro-oil advocacy group, to call for a boycott of the singer-songwriter's work. Arden had suggested in a tweet opposing Alberta's wild horse cull that the “tar sands” damaged the province's environment — not wild horses. This prompted Oil Sands Strong to call for a boycott of Arden until she retracted her comments. She did the following day, and Oil Sands Strong offered to give her a helicopter tour of Fort McMurray as a thank-you gift.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The province of Quebec — equalization payments (and also oil)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Equalization payments aren't exactly popular in Alberta. Politicians on all sides of the aisle, including Finance Minister Joe Ceci, claim that traditionally indebted provinces, such as Quebec and Ontario, get free rides thanks to Alberta's oil and gas sector. (This isn't quite the case).[https://www.thestar.com/edmonton/2018/12/11/equalization-payments-and-why-alberta-doesnt-get-them-were-rich-expert-says.html] Opposition Leader Jason Kenney has gone a step further, claiming he would hold a provincial referendum on equalization payments if elected premier. But Jean took it even further than that: boycott Quebec goods.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">His suggestion has a bit of history behind it. Quebec's government sought a court injunction against the Energy East pipeline project, designed to carry crude from Alberta to New Brunswick, in March 2016. The province claimed <span class="companylink">TransCanada</span> was advised its project was subject to the province's environmental regulations — and that it hadn't responded. While the injunction was rescinded a month later, the project was eventually cancelled in October 2017 following protests and opposition from the Quebec government. However, Quebec Premier Fran&#231;ois Legault warned other premiers at the recent first ministers' meeting that a potential revival of the project wasn't a priority, later telling reporters there “is no social acceptability for oil in Quebec.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jean claimed this attitude, combined with Quebec receiving equalization payments “funded by Alberta oil,” called for Albertans to steer clear of La Belle Province in retaliation. “It's time to start boycotting Quebec products here in Alberta,” he recently wrote on <span class="companylink">Twitter</span>. Like with many online calls for boycotts, it's unclear whether anyone has followed through on it.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One of the benefits of owning dividend growth stocks over the long term is that you often get strong share price gains as well, Rob Carrick writes. But in the short term, dividend growth stocks aren’t always showered with affection by investors. A quick check of the S&P/TSX 60 index of big blue chips shows a few stocks with double-digit dividend growth over the past five years and double-digit share price declines the past 12 months.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fans of Canadian bank stocks will appreciate this number: $45.3-billion, David Berman writes. That’s the total profit generated by the Big Six banks in fiscal 2018, and the gargantuan number reinforces why the banks have been delivering stellar gains and rising dividends over the long term. Buying all six bank stocks and holding on during rallies and downturns makes a lot of sense. But it’s also worth taking a closer look at their individual performances to gain an understanding of which bank is leading the way.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These are the times that try our souls – especially if you’re a buy and hold investor, Gordon Pape writes. As stocks tumble, the temptation was to sell everything and run for the hills. But doing so would defeat the whole purpose of buy and hold. You have to stick it out for the long haul, which means in good times and bad. Choosing good companies, stay with them, and avoid emotional reaction to market swings. The strategy works. Despite the sharp correction we experienced in recent weeks, my Buy and Hold Portfolio gained ground in the latest six-month period and is averaging a return of better than 11 per cent annually since it was launched in June 2012.

A newly built refinery in Alberta – the first in nearly 35 years – required help from the province and is now struggling. But that hasn’t stopped the Alberta government and others from repeating the same argument that the best answer to persistently low oil prices is to upgrade or refine the oil at home.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Alberta Premier Rachel Notley turned up the volume this past week, inviting oil companies to submit proposals over the next couple of months. Ms. Notley says the project must make sense for Alberta and she’s not making any specific promises of public assistance. But without the ability to get new pipelines built, she says refining capacity is among a series of measures her government is pursuing, including constraints on production set to take effect in the new year and a proposal to increase shipping oil by rail.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the industry has been skeptical of any new refining proposal, and energy experts tell Justin Giovannetti[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/canada/alberta/article-notleys-oil-refinery-pitch-met-with-industry-skepticism/] that low oil prices and Ms. Notley’s plea are unlikely to make much of a difference.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are a few reasons. Refineries can be built quicker and cheaper in places such as Asia, and it makes sense to make the finished product closer to where it will be used, in part to ensure the refined fuel matches local demands. As well, even refined fuel would need pipelines to get to market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We’ll know by February whether the province is able to overcome those obstacles and convince an oil company to pursue a refinery project. Perhaps more consequential will be the spring election campaign, when the state of the oil industry will be among the most important issues. The United Conservative Party under Leader Jason Kenney has been skeptical of Ms. Notley’s refinery plan, dismissing it as little more than a publicity stunt, and Mr. Kenney will be presenting his own plan to revive the industry.</p>

<span class="companylink">HUAWEI</span>: The pizzas, which Meng Wanzhou had delivered to the horde of reporters waiting outside her Vancouver house hoping for a brief comment the day after she was released from jail, were a rare gentle gesture in an international story that has gripped the governments of Canada and China since the beginning of the month. Ms. Meng, a senior executive at China’s premier technology company <span class="companylink">Huawei</span> and the daughter of its founder, was granted bail earlier[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/canada/british-columbia/article-huawei-cfo-meng-wanzhou-granted-bail-judge-requires-7-million-in/] this week after a contentious court hearing. She had been held in jail since her arrest at Vancouver’s airport on Dec. 1. Border guards were acting on a request from the United States, which wanted her extradited on accusations she lied about the ties between the huge Chinese technology company founded by her father and a company doing business in Iran, contrary to sanctions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But while the Crown argued Ms. Meng was likely to flee Canada in part because of an apparent record of her avoidance of the United States, B.C. Supreme Court Justice William Ehrcke accepted the $10-million in bail and the assurances of her legal team that she will wear an ankle bracelet and will submit to being under surveillance 24/7 wherever she goes in Vancouver, Richmond and North Vancouver. Said Justice Ehrcke in a sentence heavy with meaning: “Residents of countries other than the United States − including Ms. Meng − may have myriad good reasons in choosing not to travel to the United States during the past two years,” he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The sentiment was bolstered when President Donald Trump suggested in an interview with Reuters that he could intervene[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/politics/article-trumps-willingness-to-intervene-in-huawei-cfos-detention-puts-canada/] in the case against Ms. Meng if it would help the United States come to a trade pact with China. That effectively undermined Canada’s argument that Ms. Meng’s arrest was law, not politics. President Trump’s comments weren’t appreciated by the Canadians[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/politics/article-scheer-calls-for-trudeau-to-start-high-levels-talks-with-china-on/] and in fact, could offer Ms. Meng’s lawyers an argument that her prosecution has become politicized[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/politics/article-trump-has-just-harmed-his-own-governments-case/] , violating her rights.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With two Canadians detained[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/politics/article-trump-has-just-harmed-his-own-governments-case/] in apparent retaliation in China, B.C.'s trade minister cancelled his portion of a coming trade mission to China, though forestry executives continued on.[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/business/article-canadian-companies-push-forward-with-trade-trip-amid-chinese-fury-over/] As Ms. Meng gets on with life confined to the Lower Mainland and a comfortable house in the city’s Dunbar neighbourhood, the international consequences of her case won’t quell soon: The United States has not yet filed its formal extradition request and has until the beginning of February to do so.</p>

She detailed the case of a 12-year-old Indigenous boy with autism who was taken into foster care in 2016 after being found naked, starving and screaming. He had been the subject of eight separate reports to authorities, but no social worker had ever met with him, reported Lisa Steacy. Katrine Conroy, the Minister of Children and Family Development, called the situation “inexcusable,” but Mary Ellen Turpel-Lafond, B.C.’s former children’s commissioner, said she had been warning[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/canada/british-columbia/article-former-bc-childrens-representative-says-she-warned-province-about/] about government social workers failing to visit vulnerable children in three reports dating to 2011.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">TRANSIT: Regional transit officials shed some light on Surrey Mayor Doug McCallum’s move to cancel plans that had already been approved and funded to build a 16-kilometre network of light rail connecting his city in favour of a plan for SkyTrain this week. As Ian Bailey reports, a study compiled by staff, TransLink concluded the $1.6-billion committed for the light-rail plan would simply not cover the route[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/canada/british-columbia/article-vancouver-region-mayors-urge-surrey-to-accept-shortfall-for-skytrain/] between Surrey and Langley that Mr. McCallum has proposed. Other mayors called on him to compromise. But at a contentious meeting Thursday, Lower Mainland mayors grudgingly voted to move ahead with a business case[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/canada/british-columbia/article-vancouver-region-mayors-urge-surrey-to-accept-shortfall-for-skytrain/] for Mr. McCallum’s project, despite the concerns about whether it makes sense when the line has only half the funding required. The vote means the mayors will move ahead with spending $20-million and 15 months to explore the design and constructions issues for the line, Frances Bula reports.</p>

</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As publicity stunts go, it certainly received the attention it was designed to create. As word spread that the municipality had sent a letter to Calgary-based <span class="companylink">Canadian Natural Resources Ltd</span>. requesting that it pay its “fair share" of the town's costs associated with fighting the impacts of climate change, you could almost see the steam rising from the other side of the Rockies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Albertans were not amused.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We wouldn't give the ploy much attention normally, considering the sheer ridiculousness and hypocrisy that surrounds it. Whistler survives on tourism. And those tourists use oil-related products not only to get to the resort community, but to enjoy themselves while there. Also, it's not like one energy company in Calgary is responsible for all that ails the planet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But we mention it because of its incendiary effect. You don't kick a person when they're down and you don't send letters that effectively taunt someone you know is already angry.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And the anger in Alberta right now is real – something I don't think the rest of the country fully comprehends.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The recent drop in the price of oil and the continued failure to build a new pipeline has produced a fresh wave of alienation in Wild Rose country. There are people talking in earnest about separation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One hopes that conversations broaching that subject die down soon, because most know that leaving Canada would come at a terrible economic and social cost to Alberta.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The sense of betrayal inside the province is understandable. Albertans feel they're being held hostage – or at least their oil is. But some of the overheated rhetoric that is emanating from the province these days is also not helpful, and instead of eliciting the empathy and understanding people there are seeking, it is likely having the opposite effect. The rest of Canada is almost certainly tiring of the whole victimcomplex thing that is on display right now.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Currently, the person fronting the Alberta anger machine is W. Brett Wilson, a successful Calgary entrepreneur and former Dragons' Den star. On any given day, Mr. Wilson can be found spouting off on <span class="companylink">Twitter</span> about the horrible treatment the province is getting from the rest of the country. Environmental activists who have campaigned hard against the Alberta oil industry have, in particular, raised his ire.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In one highly lamentable tweet, Mr. Wilson said of them: “Bastards. Slimy bastards. Hang them for treason." When someone suggested he shouldn't joke about executing people over the pipeline dispute, Mr. Wilson doubled down: “I didn't joke. I was serious about hanging foreign-funded protesters."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Remarkably, his words were barely condemned inside Alberta. On the contrary, they got him loads of media attention as the anointed voice for those feeling frustrated about the province's lot in life.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I couldn't help thinking what the reaction inside Alberta would have been if some high-profile person suggested oil executives be hanged for killing the planet. The fury and nasty headlines that would have provoked. The sense of hurt would have been palpable.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But someone who lives in the province can say it about people who don't happen to share their love of oil. I honestly thought he'd get called out for that but he wasn't. And that's a shame.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">None of us knows for sure how this is all going to shake out. I still believe the Trans Mountain Pipeline expansion will go ahead. But something tells me it won't stifle the intense sense of grievance inside Alberta.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One pipeline won't be enough. There'll be cries anew to revive Energy East and Northern Gateway. I doubt there is any appetite for that among a majority of Canadians.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Federal Environment Minister Catherine McKenna on Friday urged the Alberta government to implement its proposed cap on oil sands greenhouse gas emissions, saying the measure is a crucial element in Canada's climate change plan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a conference call from Poland where she is attending a United Nations climate conference, the minister said Canada will have to reduce GHGs beyond the existing target to cut them by 30 per cent from 2005 levels by 2030 as the world works to avert the most catastrophic impacts of climate change. Alberta Premier Rachel Notley's climate plan – which includes the proposed cap along with a carbon tax and phaseout of coal-fired power – is a key part of the national plan to meet the current goal.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">However, Ms. Notley's NDP government indicated this week it will delay implementation of its long-promised emissions cap until after a spring election, while polls suggest Ms. Notley has a steep uphill battle to hold on to power.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Alberta set its cap and that's part of our made-in-Canada climate plan, and that's really important that Alberta follows through on that," Ms. McKenna told reporters in a call from Katowice, Poland.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The New Democratic Party government passed legislation that allows for the cap but must now adopt regulations that would spell out how it would work and what enforcement mechanisms would be used to ensure it is respected. The government has yet to release draft regulations – the usual procedure before finalizing new rules – and time is running out before a spring election campaign.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Alberta government indicated this week that it will continue to work with industry and others over the course of the next year, and confirmed that the regulations would not be finalized before the election, The Globe and Mail reported.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">United Conservative Party Leader Jason Kenney has vowed to scrap the NDP climate plan should he win government.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The province's regulation of oil sands emissions is a key factor in how the federal government will treat the sector under its environmental assessment legislation that is now before the Senate. Alberta wants most new oil sands developments exempted from a full federal review, a demand Ottawa is prepared to meet so long as the projects – which rely on steam to extract bitumen from underground – are covered under the promised emissions cap.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The impact-assessment legislation, which is now before the Senate, has drawn angry opposition from the oil industry and Alberta politicians. The United Conservative Party said this week it would oppose any move by Ottawa to regulate GHG emissions from steam-based oil sands projects, arguing the resources are owned and managed by the province.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The NDP cap would limit GHGs from the oil sands to 100 megatonnes a year of carbon dioxide, a target that still allows for a 50-per-cent increase from their levels in 2015 when Ms. Notley announced the plan. The province would exempt certain natural gas-fired power plants used for steam to extract bitumen in the oil sands, as well as some new upgraders to process bitumen into lighter oil.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Given current development plans, the industry is not expected to hit the cap before 2030, though that could change if oil prices spike higher and the three pipelines either under construction or awaiting final regulatory approvals are built.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even with the cap, the emissions from the oil industry would account for more than a fifth of the 523-megatonne target that Canada is committed to achieving by 2030.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Professor of sustainable energy at Simon Fraser University's school of resource and environmental management</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I am a climate-energy economist. Most of us tell politicians: “You must price carbon to succeed against climate change." Later, after an election, we say, “You opposed carbon pricing and won.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That's bad policy." Or, we say, “You promised carbon pricing and lost, but you would have won had I designed and explained it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">My students say I'd have been a great politician."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fiction? Think again. This has been the economists' narrative for decades as politicians wrestle with the unforgiving task of decarbonization.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But guess what? Carbon pricing is not essential to stop burning coal and gasoline. We economists only say it is because we prefer it. If we were honest, we would explain that decarbonization can be achieved entirely with regulations. These will cost more, but not a great deal more if policymakers use flexible regulations, or “flex-regs," that allow companies and individuals to determine their cheapest way to decarbonize.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Thus, policy-makers can require the phase-out of coal plants while allowing competing electricity generators to determine the cheapest mix of low-emission wind, solar, hydro, geothermal, nuclear, wood, biomethane and natural gas. Likewise, policy-makers can require the phase-out of gasoline vehicles while allowing manufacturers and consumers to determine the contributions of electric, biofuel and hydrogen vehicles.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We economists should also explain that while carbon pricing gets all the media attention, flexregs quietly do the heavy lifting. A decade ago, I helped design British Columbia's mix of a carbon tax and flex-regs. One flex-reg caused <span class="companylink">BC Hydro</span> to cancel intended coal and natural gas plants and instead develop lowcarbon options from competitive bids. This flex-reg is three times more effective than B.C.'s carbon tax, and it faced no opposition.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last month, the B.C. government copied Quebec in implementing a zero-emission vehicle standard, a flex-reg to eliminate the purchase of gasoline vehicles by 2040.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">California Air Resources Board</span> acknowledges that California's carbon-pricing policy, which Quebec shares and Ontario did briefly, accounts for only 15 per cent of recent and projected emission reductions in California.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Again, the key policies are flexregs, namely electricity's renewable portfolio standard and transportation's low carbon-fuel standard and zero-emission vehicle standard.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pollsters say Alberta Premier Rachel Notley's carbon tax contributes significantly to her dim re-election prospects. Ironically, my research team finds the new tax will cause only as much as 5 per cent of her climate plan's projected reductions. The heavy lifting is from her coal-plant phaseout, methane regulations, a preexisting flex-reg on large industries and a cap on oil sands emissions. I'll bet she wishes an economist had told her she didn't need the tax, and that it does almost nothing anyway.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to analysis by my research team, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's court-challenged carbon tax contributes 15 per cent of his climate plan's reductions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He can easily replace it by tightening the stringency of his planned clean-fuel standard, a flex-reg that applies to the same fuels as the carbon price. I'll bet he wishes an economist had told him that, as I tried to in an article in Policy Options magazine, before Mr. Trudeau announced the now much-maligned Pan-Canadian Framework.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But if carbon pricing is doing little to decarbonize the economy, why does it get all the attention? The reason is obvious to political scientists.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Surveys have long shown that taxes are a toxic issue for some voters. Unless it is an obvious tax cut, any other tax change for societal benefit can easily be framed by opponents as economically harmful. A politician proposing carbon pricing presents an irresistible target, especially if political opponents only need to swing 5 per cent of voters in key suburban ridings for electoral success.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even if most voters support carbon pricing, this doesn't matter in our first-past-the-post electoral system. What matters is small success with misinformation campaigns claiming that carbon taxes hurt middle-class suburbanites and rural residents.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some will believe it, and even if government returns carbon-tax revenue as tax cuts or dividend payments, some of these voters will still accept the untruths that carbon pricing is personally punitive.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Thus, a carbon tax puts a bullseye on a politician's back, making it easier for opponents to promise to axe the tax and replace it with ineffective policies they untruthfully claim will cause decarbonization. They might even hint at regulations, without giving a timeline.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2008, then-Liberal leader Stéphane Dion asked to meet with me to discuss his plan to campaign on a carbon tax. I told him this was good policy, but bad politics, and that it would cost him the election. He did it anyway. Sure enough, Stephen Harper focused his campaign on “jobkilling carbon taxes." Mr. Harper's victory ensured a lost decade of faking-it climate policies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This time last year, I gave talks in France at the invitation of some academics trying to warn President Emmanuel Macron's advisers that relying on carbon taxes would be a political disaster, stalling rather than advancing decarbonization. Unfortunately, their warning went unheeded, and now the violent gilets jaune protests in Paris have forced Mr. Macron to backpedal on the plan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As long as we economists tell politicians they must price carbon, instead of admitting that flex-regs and other mechanisms can do it all, humanity will continue to flounder in the face of the decarbonization challenge. Sincere politicians cannot use carbon pricing as their lead policy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even modest pricing efforts can help elect insincere politicians.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But fortunately, we don't need to price carbon.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When allocating blame for humanity's inaction on climate, it's time for us economists to look in the mirror – instead of convincing our students what great politicians we would have been.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While the broad economic benefits of such a project are manifest, a new facility could struggle in the long term, experts say</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Alberta Premier Rachel Notley's call for new oil refineries is unlikely to persuade an industry that is already skeptical about such projects, according to energy experts who say the current slump in crude prices doesn't make the idea any more attractive.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A number of refinery projects have been proposed over the past decade, many of them on B.C.'s Pacific coast. While they have been championed by local leaders who have said the refineries would create jobs and squeeze more revenue out of persistently low Canadian oil prices, only one project has been built in a generation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Earlier this week, Ms. Notley sought to capitalize on the current price of Canadian oil, which has been trading at near-record low prices in recent weeks, and asked energy companies to put forward proposals to build new refineries in her energy-rich province. None of the major energy companies based in Calgary have yet to show interest, according to energy experts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jean-Sébastien Rioux, a professor at the University of Calgary's School of Public Policy, says North America is awash with refined oil and proposed Canadian refineries have had multibillion-dollar budgets and would be far from potential customers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New refineries, if they were built in Alberta as Ms. Notley has asked, would also need new pipelines.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite the obstacles, the prospect of a new refinery holds broad appeal because it would allow for more profit from Canadian oil by selling an upgraded product at a premium, rather than the discount currently applied to raw bitumen.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Let's start making more of the product that the world needs right here at home," Ms. Notley told reporters in Edmonton on Tuesday. While she didn't announce any firm government funding for a potential project, the Premier said a new refinery would need to satisfy both a company's bottom line and Alberta's taxpayers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The project must make sense for Alberta. It must have a return on investment for Albertans and it must diversify the way we use the energy resources that we as Albertans all own. We need to see jobs for Albertans," Ms. Notley said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While the Alberta government is looking for expressions of interest over the next two months from companies willing to build or expand a refinery, Prof. Rioux said its unlikely any energy company would look at the current price of oil as a deciding factor in what could be a decade-long megaproject.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“All these big companies in downtown Calgary haven't built a new refinery in decades,"he said. "It just isn't worth the investment for them. The whole thing is a huge hill to climb. It's hard to comprehend who would stick their necks out in the current environment."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The challenges facing a new refinery are substantial.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Construction wrapped up on the North West refinery near Edmonton earlier this year. The first refinery to be built in Canada in nearly 35 years, the nearly $10billion project was behind schedule, over budget and required substantial government aid to start production. Criticized as a boondoggle, the refinery's business case is focused on producing diesel for domestic use in a roaring Alberta economy. The projected demand is largely absent in a province expected to teeter on the edge of recession in 2019.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We don't really need more diesel, at least in the near term, or even the longer term, with projections of economic growth not being as robust as before," said economist Jackie Forrest of ARC Financial Research Institute.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Normally, economic growth and diesel growth follow each other."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With North America currently producing enough refined product to meet the continent's demand, Canada is already a net exporter of gasoline. Any new refinery would need to compete with an existing refinery somewhere in Asia, closer to where Canada would look to sell its product.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A 2017 report from the <span class="companylink">IHS Markit</span> global energy consultancy looked at a number of potential sites around the world where a heavy-oil refinery could be built.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It concluded that one in the Edmonton area would be the most expensive to build and operate. A refinery in Southern China would cost nearly half as much.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Asia remains the most attractive region in which to build a new refinery," the report concluded. “Asia benefits from lower labour (and thus, capital) costs than other cases. Assuming oil sands are able to access Asia in meaningful quantities, investment in new heavy-oil refineries can be economic."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite the challenging economics, Alberta's governing New Democrats and the province's labour representatives point to the creation of jobs as a reason to support new refineries. Terry Parker, the executive director of the Building Trades of Alberta, said that construction workers need a large project, such as a new refinery, to find work in a struggling provincial economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We need to refine it where we mine it … we have far too many unemployed skilled construction workers out of work right now," said Mr. Parker, who represents 16 Alberta trade unions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The argument that refining would add value to Canada's oil exports often misses the real challenge of making more gasoline in Canada, according to Prof.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rioux. He likens it to a similar argument that the country should not export raw wheat, but should instead sell bread to other countries.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“You have to figure out what kind of bread to make: Do people want wheat, whole-grain, croissants or baguettes? Let's say they want baguettes. Then you need to find a market for a million Canadian-made baguettes. That's a real challenge," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Similarly, selling a refined product such as gasoline to a foreign country requires a Canadian refinery to make the right product, with the right level of octane at a foreign local standard, at the right time. The difficulty of striking that balance is why most large cities have nearby refineries that supply their market.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Before he became Premier in October, no Quebec politician seemed as keen to do a deal on the Energy East pipeline as François Legault.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After pushing unsuccessfully for the construction of a marine terminal on the lower St. Lawrence River to export oil from Energy East – an idea that foundered over concerns about the fate of beluga whales in the area – Mr. Legault proposed charging royalties on Western Canadian crude transported through Quebec to ensure his province would benefit financially from any pipeline.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We're aiming for zero equalization and one way to get there would be to receive royalties on the oil transiting through Quebec," Mr. Legault said in early 2016.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">No one was, therefore, more surprised than Quebeckers by Mr. Legault's outburst last week, in which he characterized oil sands crude as “dirty energy" and rejected proposals to resuscitate the pipeline that <span class="companylink">TransCanada</span> abandoned a year ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many agreed that his jab at Alberta crude was a cheap shot.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Legault has bigger worries, however, than what Albertans think about him. At home, he has been dogged by accusations that he doesn't care about the environment. Indeed, the platform of his Coalition Avenir Québec party was all but silent on climate change, and Mr. Legault's appointment of an inexperienced MNA as environment minister was seen as a sign of the issue's low priority on the CAQ agenda. The Premier is also on the defensive over his support for the construction of a fertilizer and methanol plant in Bécancour, Que., which would be one of the province's biggest industrial emitters of greenhouse gases.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So while his comments on Alberta's “dirty" oil might be seen as hypocritical, they should also be interpreted as an attempt to score brownie points with Quebec's media-savvy environmental movement.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Legault is also attempting to step up pressure on Ottawa, Ontario and New Brunswick to back his proposal for more interprovincial electricity sales by Quebec. Selling hydro power may be a separate issue altogether from Energy East, but that will not stop Mr. Legault from attempting to advance his cause by linking the two, sparking his comment after last week's first ministers meeting that he is “not ashamed at all of refusing dirty energy while we're offering clean energy at a very competitive price."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He should have known his comment would be seen as particularly crude in the context of the current downturn in Alberta oil prices that has left Canada's richest province in a funk. The fiscal crisis facing Alberta has national consequences, and Mr. Legault could come to eat his words, given that his province depends on federal equalization transfers that are disproportionately funded by Alberta taxpayers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Legault may believe his province is insulated from western calls for reform of the equalization formula by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's unwillingness to risk losing Quebec seats in 2019. But the current formula – which will see Quebec's take rise 12 per cent next year to $13.1billion, or two-thirds of all funds paid out under the program – cries out for reform.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The size of the equalization pool has continued to rise in recent years, even though the wealth gap between “have" provinces such as Alberta and “havenot" provinces such as Quebec has shrunk. What's more, Quebec – whose economy has been growing at a strong clip – has continued to see its payments rise far faster than those of the Atlantic provinces, which are in far worse fiscal shape.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Any reasonable understanding of the aims of fiscal federalism suggests this simply should not be the case.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Leaving a review of the formula to politicians has its disadvantages. Former prime minister Stephen Harper adopted the current equalization formula, which Mr. Trudeau's government recently renewed until 2024, with its sights set squarely on keeping Quebec happy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Daniel Béland of the <span class="companylink">University of Saskatchewan</span>, André Lecours of the <span class="companylink">University of Ottawa</span> and their co-authors of a recent book on fiscal federalism suggest that Ottawa should set up a permanent arm's-length agency to determine equalization payments and make recommendations regarding adjustments to the formula.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“At the very least, the appearance of federal executive discretion almost inevitably creates the impression among provincial governments that the program is not always administered neutrally," they wrote in a recent Policy Options article.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Until then, Mr. Legault should watch what he says. If he truly seeks to wean Quebec off equalization payments, kicking Alberta when it's down is an odd way of going about it.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Suncor said the Alberta government's decision to force producers to cut back their output by 8.7 per cent has resulted in "winners and losers" in the province. The company, the largest integrated producer in Canada, is also discussing "unintended consequences" with the province and seeking some relief from the order.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"In the short term, the Government of Alberta action has resulted in winners and losers in the market, shutting in valuable upgrading throughput and has made transporting crude oil out of the province by rail uneconomic," the Calgarybased operator said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Suncor did not specifically identify itself among the "losers" in the situation, but it did - along with <span class="companylink">Husky Energy Inc</span>. and <span class="companylink">Imperial Oil Ltd</span>. - oppose the curtailment and on Friday acknowledged it will need to shut-in more than 8.7 per cent of its production. The company did not provide a figure for how much of its production it is required to curtail.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite the order, Suncor has said it intends to boost its average oil production by 10 per cent over the course of the next year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The Government of Alberta intervention creates long-term market uncertainty, and reduces any incentive for market participants to invest in crude oil processing facilities or commit to long-term transportation agreements," the company said, adding the order would also result in companies "shutting in valuable upgrading throughput."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Suncor's announcement comes on the heels of Alberta Premier Rachel Notley's call this week for proposals for new refinery projects in the province.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Notley issued her government's curtailment order this month amid record-setting US$40 per barrel and US$50 per barrel discounts for Alberta heavy crude oil, relative to the West Texas Intermediate benchmark.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The order has since helped narrow the differential to about US$12.50, and boosted share prices of domestic companies that are exposed to the benchmark price. Suncor, Imperial and Husky operate refineries, however, which had insulated them from the discounts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Suncor has much to lose from the production cuts as it also operates oilsands upgraders near Fort McMurray, Alta. as well as refineries in Alberta, Ontario, Quebec and Colorado.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We feel that we upgrade or refine about 70 per cent of our production in Alberta already and the disproportionate allocation has idled some of that upgrading capacity and that hasn't addressed the issue which is market access," Suncor spokesperson Sneh Seetal said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She declined to directly discuss the provincial government's call for refinery proposals.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Seetal said the curtailment order could have several "unintended consequences" and as facilities operate at less than their designed capacity, there are safety concerns about potential heat loss and freezing. The company is taking steps to mitigate any potential safety risks and is in discussions with the Alberta government.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Suncor is also discussing other potential consequences with the provincial government and the Alberta Energy Regulator as the curtailment order failed to take into account how a forced production cut would affect oil that is refined and upgraded in Alberta and its in-house production and consumption of diesel as oil consumed at its own operations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Those factors don't affect the volumes on clogged pipelines leaving Alberta, which were the root cause of the massive price discounts that hammered smaller oil producers in the province, the company said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Raymond James analyst Chris Cox called Suncor's curtailment "mandatory charity" for smaller oil producers in a research note, but added the company's capital budget on Friday was a positive for investors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"While the impact of mandated production cuts in Alberta is likely to have a disproportionately negative impact on Suncor versus peers, we agree with the company's assessment that the full effects of the cuts are likely to last only for the first three months of 2019," Cox said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Suncor unveiled a capital budget of between $4.9 billion and $5.6 billion for 2019 on Friday, roughly the same as it spent in 2018, but expects to grow its total oil production by about 10 per cent over the full course of the year to between 780,000 barrels per day and 820,000 bpd.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The company may be able to increase its spending in 2019 if its negotiations with the provincial government and AER on curtailment issues progress, National Bank Financial analyst Travis Wood said in a research note.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Suncor stock closed 3.3 per cent lower to $39.62 in Toronto on Friday.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Thank you to Thomas Walkom for this thoughtful column.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There is a growing movement of young people calling for climate action and environmental justice, through school strikes, sit-ins and a recent lawsuit in Quebec against the federal government's failure to take meaningful action.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Parents and teachers want the best for our children. But we are busy and anxious providing what they need to thrive now, so it's hard to look to the future at something over which we seem to have so little control.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As a new parent, there is nothing I want more than for my daughter to grow up in a stable climate, not only for herself. And I don't want her to have the weight of knowing that children in other places are facing hunger, flooding or displacement because we didn't act.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If we come together in solidarity with the youth, we have power. In Canada, we can lead the way to the rapid and intense climate action the planet needs. No new fossil-fuel infrastructure. We need high and rising carbon taxes returned to the taxpayers and intense investment in green infrastructure, jobs and social justice infrastructure.</p>

</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sutherland acknowledged the city has limited authority over pipelines and the energy industry, which largely falls under federal and provincial jurisdiction, but hinted council has “a couple plans” up its sleeve. He declined to elaborate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“It seems the public, in general, don't think we're supportive, but there are also some things we can do as a city that perhaps could influence things,” Sutherland said. “We're going to announce on Monday a few things we could actually do that are positive.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An agenda for Monday's rally, obtained by StarMetro, reveals three councillors — Sutherland, Jyoti Gondek and Peter Demong — and Mayor Naheed Nenshi are slated to speak at the event along with representatives from Canada Action.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I Love Oil and Gas” T-shirts will be made available for council members to wear during the rally, according to the document, which also states: “Councillors are entitled to their views, but remember, this rally is about our city supporting the energy sector.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Cody Battershill, founder of the pro-oil group Canada Action, said Monday's rally is intended to be non-partisan and expects 500 to 1,000 people to attend.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We're all Canadian,” said Battershill. “It doesn't matter who you vote for, making sure people are employed and families have food on the table matters regardless of whether you're so-called left or so-called right.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As a federally registered not-for-profit, Canada Action Coalition Ltd.'s financial backers are not publicly available. But Battershill, a Calgary-based real estate agent, said the group has largely been funded out of pocket, through T-shirt sales, and, increasingly, by donations from unions, First Nations, and the construction and energy sectors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“It's an important conversation, and we've been very careful to build a balanced and respectful message and make sure that our campaign is reaching coast to coast,” he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Battershill said he'd like to see council use city resources and partners, such as <span class="companylink">Calgary Economic Development</span>, to ensure “people's opinions are based on facts” when it comes to the industry.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sonia Kont, a consultant with New West Public Affairs who previously served as the communications chair for the United Conservative Party, said she was hired to help council and Canada Action organize the rally and produce the videos and social media campaign.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I'm just there as an organizer to make sure that everybody's voice is heard and that we're united on messaging,” she said, adding council members used money from their office budgets to give the campaign “a bit more credibility.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She noted all councillors and the mayor are on board with the initiative, with each elected official appearing in separate videos[https://twitter.com/Ward4Ward1/status/1072899248629248000] to promote different aspects of the industry.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I'm hoping if council continues to work with groups like Canada Action, which is non-partisan, in promoting our resources and being proud of our resources, we're hoping to challenge other municipal governments around Alberta and, of course, Canada to do the same,” said Kont.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nenshi, who plans to speak at Monday's rally, dismissed suggestions the city and council have not been sufficiently vocal in supporting the province's energy industry.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I've given speeches in Montreal in French and in Vancouver,” said Nenshi. “I've gone into the mouth of the lion and spoken to environmentalists about the importance of clean energy. I've had hundreds of thousands of hits online on this. This is just work we continue to do.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Monday, council will debate Councillor Jeromy Farkas's notice of motion calling for the city to make an official statement of support for Alberta oil and pipelines.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The motion would also direct city bureaucrats to explore “advocacy options,” review other cities' efforts to influence pipeline construction, and consider withdrawing from associations like the Federation of Canadian Municipalities (FCM).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Kont maintained Monday's rally is intended to be non-partisan and entirely separate from Farkas's motion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Personally, I don't know if it's a good idea for Calgary as a major city to pull out of the FCM,” she said. “That's a big risk, in my opinion.”</p>

</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In an interview with StarMetro on Wednesday, Scott said his motion comes from years of frustration at the trend of fly-in, fly-out work that has become “normalized” in the region. He referenced 2015 census data, that shows there are about 38,000 workers living in 109 camps in the region — roughly 30 per cent of the total population.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“These statistics speak for themselves, and the situation is completely unacceptable,” Scott said. People living in these camps are mostly in the region for work, and are not permanent residents of Fort McMurray, which Scott said has a tremendously negative impact on the city economically.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We want people living in our region,” Scott said. “Those extracting resources from our region should live in our region.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The percentage of the population living in work camps around Fort McMurray exceeds the 10 per cent limit set by the Wood Buffalo Municipal Development Plan in 2011, Scott said. “The situation is just going from bad to worse, in my view,” he said.</p>

Study looks at strain between Fort McMurray residents and fly-in workers[https://www.thestar.com/edmonton/2018/09/04/were-more-than-oil-fort-mcmurray-residents-upset-over-temporary-workers.html]
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The motion was met with little opposition at council when it was proposed, and is slated to be debated on Jan. 22. But oilsands workers say they are not happy with Scott's plan for work camps, which they believe will do more harm than good for the region if it's approved.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Karim Zariffa, executive director of the Oil Sands Community Alliance (OSCA), an organization representing oilsands producers based in Fort McMurray, said he was “surprised and disappointed” after hearing of Scott's motion to put an end to work camps.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“It's discouraging for development, and doesn't respect the spirit of collaboration we had between industry and the (municipality),” he said. Zariffa added this motion comes at an exceptionally volatile time, when the “industry is being challenged to attract capital to the oilsands.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a statement, Premier Rachel Notley said her government has been “unequivocal” in supporting the province's energy sector, but she understands the need for a balance in meeting both the needs of the industry and the communities that surround it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We hope that in this case, the municipality and industry can arrive at a solution that defends the long-term sustainability of the industry, while addressing the concerns of the region's residents,” Notley said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Work camps have been the preferred living arrangement for oilsands workers, Zariffa said, because they provide adequate accommodations for sites that are often remote. They are also created out of safety concerns for workers who fly in and fly out for work.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Industry already has a hard enough time attracting and retaining people who choose to actually rotate in and out,” he said. “If you eliminate the camps, it's going to be a lot more difficult to recruit and retain people.” He added this will drive up industry costs for companies, as it will impact their operations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Zariffa said phasing out work camps could also indirectly impact local businesses that provide services to those camps.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Scott maintains that the high population of residents living in work camps is the reason Fort McMurray has had a challenge in attracting businesses from out of town to open shop in the region. He added work camps have also contributed to a high rate of home foreclosures in Fort McMurray.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“It's killing our economy,” said Jeff Peddle, Ward 1 councillor for the Wood Buffalo municipality, who heavily supports the mayor's motion. “(The workers) use our resources, the hospitals, the water ... and we don't get the benefit of them because they're not actually residents.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Beyond economic impacts, research from the Firelight Group, a collective focused on issues affecting Indigenous communities, has found that work camps contributed to a sharp increase in both the sex trade and sex trafficking in Fort McMurray. This is attributed to the social isolation of workers from their families, and the “hypermasculine context” of camps.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Work camps have also been shown to strain already limited health services in northern Alberta, according to the group's research, with health professionals noting the influx of camp workers can flood medical services at regional hospitals.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of the 109 existing camps around Fort McMurray, 56 will see their permit applications expire in 2022, which Scott said provides a timely opportunity to discuss their impact and the possibility of shuttering them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He said he remains a big supporter for the oilsands industry in the region, “but there needs to be a balance.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I would've preferred a different route, but now that we're at this point, there's got to be a major change,” Scott said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Zariffa said he and oil producers from OSCA will be at the Jan. 22 council meeting to debate the mayor's motion.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The plan to cut production in the oil patch seems to have brought about a near-miraculous recovery in Alberta crude prices, but energy investors aren’t buying it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In less than two weeks since the province of Alberta ordered oil companies to curtail output starting in the New Year, Western Canadian Select (WCS) has nearly doubled in price, taking a huge discount on Canadian oil back down to normal levels.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Oil and gas stocks, on the other hand, have not only sat out the commodity rebound, they have continued to decline. The S&P/TSX Composite Energy Sector Index is down by 2 per cent since production cuts were announced, leaving the sector’s total loss at 21 per cent since July.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The divergence suggests investors are doubtful that the homegrown oil crisis is over, said Rafi Tahmazian, a portfolio manager at Canoe Financial in Calgary.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“No sophisticated energy investor is going to invest in a country that has this kind of turmoil.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Canadian oil prices collapsed over the summer and fall as a shortage of pipeline capacity left producers scrambling to find alternative ways of getting their oil to market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With Alberta’s oil output at record levels, and with a key U.S. Midwest refinery offline for more than two months starting in September, the industry increasingly resorted to shipments by rail and even by truck, while storage tanks were filled to capacity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The confluence of setbacks slashed prices on Canadian heavy crude by 75 per cent over four months, as WCS sank to a low of US$13.46 a barrel in mid-November, opening up a differential against U.S. crude as high as US$50 a barrel.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Western Canadian Select is the main price benchmark for Alberta heavy crude oil. The price that individual producers receive for their oil depends on a number of factors, including the quality of the crude and the cost to transport it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Estimating the cost of the oil price gap on the Canadian economy of $80-million every day, Alberta Premier Rachel Notley said the province would intervene in the oil market to ease the supply glut. About 325,000 barrels a day – 8.7 per cent of the Alberta’s oil-patch output – will be cut starting next month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Notley suggested that the move would reduce the oil price differential by US$4 a barrel. That turned out to be a wildly conservative estimate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WCS has nearly doubled in price since the announcement, to rise north of US$40 a barrel for the first time since September. The discount against West Texas Intermediate, meanwhile, has shrunk to US$12 – well below the long-term average of around US$17.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Considering that the mandatory production cut has not even taken effect, and does little to address the sector’s fundamental problems, Canadian oil is unlikely to maintain its new-found strength, said Judith Dwarkin, chief economist at RS Energy Group.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“This is simply a stopgap measure. We'll still have a full pipeline and more demand than there is takeaway capacity.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The exaggerated oil-price rally was partly a reversal of what was an excessive slide fuelled by heavy competition for limited pipeline space, Ms. Dwarkin said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Getting on the pipeline every month that doesn't have enough capacity for all comers causes prices to collapse as desperation mounts,” she said. “It’s like musical chairs.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rather than adding a chair in the form of a new pipeline, curtailing production removes a player from the game.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Tahmazian added that "curtailment did a financial manoeuvre on pricing. It didn’t bring back the investors.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Government intervention in oil production, while welcomed by some industry analysts and executives as a necessary move, makes it even more difficult to put a value on Canadian energy companies, which were already saddled with the uncertainty of Canada’s pipeline saga.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We've been out of the Canadian E&P space for more than a year,” said David Sherlock, portfolio manager at SAGE Connected Investing in Calgary. “Not until we get clarity on pipelines. And I think there are other folks around the globe that are thinking that way.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On the other hand, Brian See, a portfolio manager at CIBC Asset Management, said the mandatory production cut will go a long way to rebalancing the market, which is also being facilitated by rail shipments of crude and the return of refinery capacity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We think it’s more of an opportunity to pick up higher-quality names at attractive valuations,” Mr. See said, citing <span class="companylink">Cenovus Energy Inc</span>. and <span class="companylink">Canadian Natural Resources Ltd</span>., both of which are down by 27 per cent from their respective 52-week highs.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Early numbers suggest there’s not enough legal pot to go around.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">Health Canada</span> figures show sales of recreational marijuana of 4,386 kilograms of the dried stuff from Oct. 17, when it became legal, to Oct. 31. The dried equivalent of cannabis oil adds 269 kg to that, according to an analysis of <span class="companylink">Health Canada</span>’s numbers by <span class="companylink">AltaCorp Capital</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When you add in sales of medical pot, which <span class="companylink">Health Canada</span> reported for the entire month of October, you get a sense of how much is being spent, though the recreational side is only for 15 days.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There have been supply problems and a scarcity of retail outlets since pot became legal, and AltaCorp now doubts spending on legal cannabis this year will reach levels estimated earlier by <span class="companylink">Statistics Canada</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“As many observers expected, the ramp-up in legal sales will be a process,” AltaCorp said in its recent report.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“While the measurement period is far too short to draw any meaningful projections from, it does seem evident that initial sales have been dampened by supply shortages and lack of retail storefronts, both of which are not sufficient to keep pace with Canadians’ demand for legal cannabis.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ontario Cannabis Store deliveries were hurt by rotating strikes against Canada Post, while British Columbia had only one shop up and running on Oct. 17, AltaCorp noted, citing, too, supply issues in Alberta and Quebec</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">(Whoever would have thought that, in 1970, say, you’d be complaining that you couldn’t get a buzz because of a labour dispute at the post office, right?)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Despite the clear strength of demand, until these supply side issues begin to resolve, we expect that legal sales may be lower than some had initially forecast,” AltaCorp said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But fear not, entrepreneurs and big business. These are very early days.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Indeed, in another report this week, AltaCorp looked at sales numbers in several U.S. states and projected “significant room for growth” in Canada.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The data suggest we can expect a lift in spending per capita, as Canada’s legal market begins to ramp up in the coming months years,” AltaCorp said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“In our view, the most significant factor contributing to the increased spending per capita observed in mature legal markets is the greater market share occupied by higher-margin derivative products, such as edibles, extracts and beverages,” it added.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“These products typically sell for a significant premium versus dried flower on a per-serving basis.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Thus, certain businesses are poised to benefit when other products, such as edibles, become legal, which is expected to start next fall.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Wall Street futures followed world stocks lower early Friday as new figures out of China and Europe cast fresh doubt on the strength of the global economy. Dow futures were down by triple digits ahead of the North American open while <span class="companylink">Nasdaq</span> and S&P futures were off by about 1 per cent. World stocks were broadly lower with MSCI’s all-country index falling about half a per cent. In Canada, futures on Bay Street were also weaker with economic data weighing.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Global stocks took a hit after China reported weaker-than-expected retail sales in November, growing at the slowest pace since 2003. At the same time, figures out of Europe showed a surprise contraction in French business activity in December and a slowdown in German private-sector expansion to a four-year low.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Waning global growth sentiment continues to drag equity markets into the tank after a double whammy of major economic data misses has sent investors scurrying for cover,” <span class="companylink">OANDA</span> analyst Stephen Innes said. “Weak Chinese retail sales data got the ball rolling south, but European risk assets are getting pounded mercilessly after the French PMI plunges into contraction territory.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He said, while yellow vest protests may be at the root of the issue in France, that doesn’t explain Germay’s “wobbly” PMI figures suggesting “underlying euro zone economy remains soft, providing the key fundamental reasons to be underweight (the euro).”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Bay Street, pot stocks will likely be in the spotlight after Ontario scaled back its plans for storefront marijuana sales in the province, citing concerns about shortages. Instead of opening an uncapped number of stores on April 1, the province will adopt a phased-in approach, limiting the initial number [https://www.theglobeandmail.com/cannabis/article-ontario-limiting-cannabis-stores-to-25-at-first-citing-supply/] of available retail licences to 25.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Shares of <span class="companylink">DavidsTea Inc</span>. could also get some attention once trading starts. After Thursday’s close, the company reported a net loss of 35 cents a share, compared with 25 cents a year earlier. Sales rose 1.5 per cen to $43.7-million from $43-million in the same quarter of 2017. Herschel Segal, the company’s founder and interim CEO, said during an call with analysts that DavidsTea is seeing “favourable trends in several areas of the business." The Canadian Press reports that analysts were not permitted to ask questions during the call. Mr. Segal took over as interim CEO after the company’s investors voted 54 per cent in favour of his slate of seven directors over management’s nominees. Joel Silver, former CEO, left the post after the vote.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Wall Street, shares of <span class="companylink">Costco Wholesale Corp</span>. were down about 3 per cent in premarket trading after a decline in gross margins cast a shadow over better-than-expected sales in the latest quarter. Higher gas prices led margins to fall 50 basis points to 10.75 per cent in the first quarter. Excluding gas, margins were down 26 basis points. Total revenue, however, rose 10.2 per cent to US$35.07-billion, topping the US$34.80-billion analysts had been forecasting. Same-store sales excluding fuel and currency fluctuations, rose 7.5 per cent, also beating analysts forecasts of 5.8-per-cent growth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. markets also got November retail sales figures, which came in roughly in line with forecasts on the headline but the details were much better than expected. The <span class="companylink">U.S. Commerce Department</span> said sales rose 0.2 per cent for the month. Economists had forecast an increase of 0.1 per cent. However, retail sales excluding automobiles, gasoline, building materials and food services surged 0.9 per cent last month after an upwardly revised 0.7 per cent increase in October.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“That brings the three-month average annualized pace of core retail sales to 4.2 per cent which is above the pace seen in Q3,” CIBC economist Katherine Judge said. “A heady 2.3-per-cent increase in online retail sales drove a large portion of sales. This is consistent with the Fed raising interest rates at their meeting next week and we have revised our consumption forecast for Q4 up in line with recent strong indicators of spending growth.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Overseas, the pan-European STOXX 600 fell about 1 per cent with most major sectors in the red. Trade-sensitive auto stocks were among the top decliners. Britain’s FTSE 100 fell 0.75 per cent. Germany’s DAX lost 0.98 per cent. France’s CAC 40 slid 0.87 per cent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Asia, disappointing Chinese economic data hit sentiment. The Shanghai Composite Index finished the week’s final session down 1.53 per cent. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng lost 1.62 per cent. Japan’s Nikkei fell 2.02 per cent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Commodities</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Weak Chinese economic data hit crude prices early Friday, although continued optimism over <span class="companylink">OPEC</span>’s coming production cuts helped cap the losses. Brent and West Texas Intermediate were both weaker ahead of the North American open. Brent has a day range of US$60.77 to US$61.53. WTI’s range was US$52.11 to US$52.95.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At this point, Brent looks set for a weekly decline of about 1 per cent. Slower-than-forecast retail sales along with disappointing industrial output are weighing on energy prices alongside equity markets. <span class="companylink">OPEC</span>’s move to cut production by 1.2 million barrels a day in the new year has helped curb some of the losses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a morning note, <span class="companylink">OANDA</span>’s Craig Erlam questions whether oil prices have now bottomed out in the wake of the <span class="companylink">OPEC</span> move or if the current markets are just seeing a pause in selling.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The post-production cut impact on oil prices has been modest to say the least but for now at least, the failure to break new lows will come as a relief,” Mr. Erlam said. “We now look stuck in a tight range near the lows, between US$50-US$54 in WTI and US$58-US$63 in Brent. This may in itself be a bottoming setup in itself but there doesn’t appear to be too many rushing to get in at these levels which suggest sentiment may be tilted to the downside for a little longer yet.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In other commodities, a stronger U.S. dollar continues to weigh on gold with prices falling for the second straight session to a one-week low early Friday. Spot gold was down 0.3 per cent at US$1,238.86 per ounce by midmorning in Europe. Earlier Friday, prices touched US$1,236.80, their weakest levels since Dec. 6. Gold prices are down about 0.7 per cent this week.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“[The U.S. dollar] remains an essential driver for gold price action,” <span class="companylink">OANDA</span>’s Stephen Innes said, noting gold prices pulled back from the top of recent ranges as the U.S. dollar against the euro following a dovish <span class="companylink">ECB</span> statement on Thursday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Next week, markets get the next policy decision from the <span class="companylink">U.S. Federal Reserve</span>. Mr. Innes says, for gold, “bullish tactical plays come to the fore” with the Fed expected to remain dovish, sending the green back lower.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Currencies and bonds</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Canadian was slightly weaker as its U.S. counterpart headed for its best weekly performance against a basket of currencies since August. The day range on the loonie so far is 74.62 US cents to 74.92 US cents. For the loonie, the day’s key even is the release of the third-quarter national balance sheet, which RBC chief currency strategist Adam Cole says will be watched for trends in household debt and associated servicing costs. BMO senior economist Sal Guatieri also said in an early note that <span class="companylink">Moody’s</span> downgrade to Ontario’s credit rating[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/business/article-moodys-downgrades-ontarios-credit-rating-citing-revenue-cuts-under/] was weighing on the loonie early Friday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On world currency markets, the U.S. dollar index is up about 1 per cent since the start of the week.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Cole said China’s weak November figures have dominated overnight price action with the Australia and New Zealand dollars notably weak. He also said latest news out of Brussels on Britain’s exit from the <span class="companylink">EU</span> “is not very encouraging.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Whilst PM [Theresa] May was never likely to get a warm reception and this is only the opening stage of new negotiations, May’s initial proposals appear to have been rejected out of hand and her negotiating style strongly criticized,” he said. “The summit is ongoing today, but it is unlikely anything like a concrete proposal on an addendum/amendment to the Brexit agreement will emerge so soon.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In bonds, <span class="companylink">U.S. Treasury</span> yields fell on the weak economic news out of China. The yield on the 10-year note was lower at 2.88 per cent.</p>

The company also expects capital expenditure to be in the range of $4.9-billion to $5.6-billion. “The midpoints of these ranges represent a flat capital spend compared to 2018," Suncor said in a statement.</p>

<span class="companylink">Apple Inc</span> , facing a court ban in China on some of its iPhone models over alleged infringement of <span class="companylink">Qualcomm Inc</span> patents, said on Friday it will push software updates to users in a bid to resolve potential issues. Apple will carry out the software updates at the start of next week “to address any possible concern about our compliance with the order,” the firm said in a statement sent to Reuters. Earlier this week, <span class="companylink">Qualcomm</span> said a Chinese court had ordered a ban on sales of some older iPhone models for violating two of its patents, though intellectual property lawyers said the ban would likely take time to enforce. “Based on the iPhone models we offer today in China, we believe we are in compliance,” Apple said.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Time to consider self-government</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Indigenous Peoples have been mistreated for approximately 150 years, through the atrocity of residential schools and reserves, and it has come time for change to take place. The current system under the Indian Act is not working; Indigenous Peoples are still living in horrible situations. A new system is needed, one that allows Indigenous Peoples to self-govern.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, which Canada has recognized, self-government is an inherent right. This self-government can allow for economic development as well as social development to take place.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Indigenous self-government needs to be given a fair trial, yet it cannot be a one-size-fits-all approach. It needs to be unique to each community and band.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One effect of self-government needs to be a drastic increase in economic independence. Money should stay in the community. It points towards import replacement — when a community produces the products that it usually imports.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another aspect of economic development that needs to be sorted out is allowing for Indigenous people to take out loans and have access to money to start a business. Individual Indigenous people are not able to access money to start a business unless they team up with another organization. Status Indigenous people living on reserves cannot offer up a guarantee for a loan since they do not have ownership of land. It can be a large deterrent when it comes to starting a business.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Having different businesses — as well as honest chiefs and councils — will allow for social development to take place. Some of this will need the help of the federal government, yet most of it needs to happen under the supervision of an Indigenous self-government. Some problems that Indigenous Peoples face are high suicide rates, violence against women, alcoholism and drug abuse, poor sanitary conditions, a lack of quality education and high unemployment. Honest social development would allow for these problems to lessen.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Having a consistent source of income in the community will provide a tool for fixing these problems. I am not advocating throwing money at the problem, rather, that working for an income will bring independence and care for the rest of the community. The communal aspect will allow for all individuals inside it to profit. If the claim of Indigenous people in business is that everyone around profits at the end of the day, then how about we give them a chance and allow for it to happen? As one can clearly see, the benefits outweigh the risks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This concept needs to be more than considered; it requires implementation before more lives are adversely affected. With a concrete vision in place, self-government for Indigenous Peoples can become a reality.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Quebec and ‘clean' oil</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Re: Quebec slams door on New Brunswick's pipeline dream at premiers meeting (Dec. 7)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The new premier of Quebec pronounced at the latest first ministers conference with Prime Minister Justin Trudeau that he makes no apology for banning Alberta-sourced “dirty" heavy oil (via pipeline) from Quebec, as he would choose clean oil over dirty oil.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The big problem with that thinking is that Quebec sources a good portion of its fossil fuels from tankers from Nigeria and Saudi Arabia — two countries with less-than-sterling human-rights records and likely less-than-stringent environmental controls.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To top it off, this “clean" oil is exempt from any penalties or carbon taxes levied by the Trudeau government on Canadian-produced oil. A bit of a double standard, but a definite win for Quebec. Quebec would rather support foreign countries with world-market-priced oil than Canadian-sourced oil — oil, it should be noted, that helps pay for Quebec's rich transfer payments. Or at least it did before the crash in Alberta heavy-crude prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is worth noting that Quebec will receive an additional $1.4 billion in transfer payments in 2019, bringing its total infusion to $13.1 billion annually. While the transfer-payment calculation is complex and difficult to explain, we are told the Trudeau government has locked in the current transfer calculation for five years. This no doubt will sit them in good stead in Quebec for the coming federal election. Good move from Trudeau's standpoint. Not so good for the country on many levels.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Re: Menus start catering to flexitarians (Dec. 11)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sylvain Charlebois tells us that we must get off beef. He is absolutely right. Beef cattle are extremely hard on the environment; they are picky eaters and demand only the choicest of grass, so that after a time the pasture becomes totally overgrown with weeds and has to be cleaned, ideally by running sheep on it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sheep, on the other hand, will eat everything, down to ground level, with the result that after a year or so of pasturing sheep on a piece of land, it has only the finest of lawn grasses on it. The growing point of grass is below ground level. Because they are eating everything, the sheep need far less pasture. Those pictures we see of old English estates with their acres of beautiful lawns, long before the lawn mower was invented, were lawns mowed by sheep.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It would not be quite so bad to be eating beef if we were really eating the beef, but we are wasting 40 per cent of it. When I lived in Ontario, there were five beef farmers in the township and in the fall they would butcher a steer for themselves, and I would sometimes help with the butchering. Even if I was not asked to help, I would go and collect the tongue, heart, kidneys and tail of every animal that was butchered.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When I was in my early teens, I did delivery for the local butcher and also had the job, every Tuesday, of cleaning out the small intestines of the lambs he had butchered on Monday so the they could become sausage skins. The rest of the “innards" would be chopped finely, mixed with oatmeal and stuffed into the stomach to become haggis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A baker in Melton Mowbray, England, invented the Melton Mowbray pork pie, using parts of the pig which are wasted nowadays. He used only the head and the feet. He boiled the hocks to get the gelatin from the joints and chopped the skin of the head and ears to supplement the little bit of red meat. The meat went on the bottom of the pie and the aspic was on the top. Today, you can buy Melton Mowbray pork pie in the deli section of the meat counter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We should get back to eating more of the organ meats, and much more lamb and pork.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">PREMIER Brian Pallister has added his voice to the chorus of opponents to a federal bill that critics say would stifle investment in the oil and gas industry.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Speaking to reporters Thursday, Pallister called on Ottawa to place a hold on Bill C-69, which is before the Senate.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He said if it becomes law, it would also threaten to unduly lengthen the time required to build hydro transmission lines or flood-protection projects, such as the planned outlets for Lake Manitoba and Lake St. Martin.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Neither the Trans-Canada Highway nor the country's transcontinental railways would have been built under the current regulatory and political climate, the premier argued.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He said this paralysis threatens national unity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“If we can't even build flood protection in Manitoba without extensive delays occurring, then our confederation is stalled," the premier said. “And I don't think it's too strong to say that we're moving in a direction where we're inviting disharmony among our Canadian provinces."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ottawa says Bill C-69 would provide greater regulatory certainty and predictability for companies looking to invest in resource development. The energy sector and the Alberta government disagree, calling it flawed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pallister said he fears the proposed legislation would make it “almost impossible" to carry out resource-based projects in Canada. He said it would also blur jurisdictional boundaries over these projects, creating “fog" when what is needed is clarity, and making lawyers rich as a result.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He said resource projects could be delayed unnecessarily for long periods of time “and perhaps forever" because “one or another interest group has to be listened to."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The federal government has said that it wants to reduce red tape. The federal government has said that it wants to reduce interprovincial barriers to trade. And I applaud those words. But you can't say one thing and do another that is totally contradictory at the same time," Pallister said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He said he can respect a project review process that gives “considerable attention" to the long-term environmental sustainability of the country. But he said economic sustainability is important, too.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pallister has said that the approval process for the Lake Manitoba and Lake St. Martin projects was to have taken a year, but he said Ottawa has changed the rules midstream. He worries the process will take considerably longer, delaying flood protection for vulnerable communities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, Pallister criticized the federal government for failing to challenge a controversial statement Quebec Premier François Legault made recently regarding the attempted resumption of the Energy East pipeline project. Legault said he didn't want Canada's “dirty energy" to flow though Quebec.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Without mentioning Legault by name, Pallister suggested the comment was hypocritical since Quebec's largest import is crude oil from Saudi Arabia, Colombia and other countries.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Public Utilities Commission unanimously rejected petitions by environmental and Indigenous groups that asked the panel to reconsider its 3-2 decision in June to approve a route permit for the line across northern Minnesota. Those opponents acknowledged ahead of time that they held out little hope, given the commission earlier this month unanimously rejected their petitions to reconsider the project's certificate of need.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Supporters of the project started arriving before 6 a.m. and grabbed most of the 83 public seats in the hearing room. So only a few opponents, from environmental groups including MN350 and Native American tribes, were in the room to protest immediately after the decision.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Line 3 is a climate change disaster, so we will stop Line 3," they chanted.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Groups fighting the project conceded beforehand that persuading their people to show up and wait in line in the cold for an uncertain chance at a seat had become more difficult. But around 30 people from MN350 and other groups gathered near the hearing room afterward for a short rally.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now opponents are shifting their focus to the Minnesota Court of Appeals and preparing for demonstrations along the route as construction preparations get under way.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“This is not the last time I'll be seeing any of you," Andy Pearson, Midwest tar sands co-ordinator for MN350, vowed to the protesters.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">Enbridge</span> wants to replace its existing Line 3 because it was built in the 1960s and is increasingly subject to cracking and corrosion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Line 3 crosses northern Minnesota and a corner of North Dakota on its way from the oil fields of Alberta to Enbridge's terminal in Superior, Wis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Calgary-based Enbridge convinced the commission that it's a critical safety issue.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The replacement of Line 3 is a safety and maintenance driven project intended to protect the communities and the environment in northern Minnesota," <span class="companylink">Enbridge</span> said in a statement afterward. “The approved route represents more than 115,000 hours of engineering and environmental study, ensuring the safety of communities and the protection of cultural and natural resources."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Environmental and tribal groups say the project will aggravate climate change because the new line will carry Canadian oil sands crude, which generates more climate-warming carbon dioxide during the production process than regular oil. They also object because of the potential for leaks where it crosses the pristine Mississippi River headwaters region, where Native Americans harvest wild rice and claim treaty rights. They say the oil should stay in the ground.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Native American activist Winona LaDuke, executive director of Honor the Earth, issued a statement saying the commission had “recklessly acquiesced" to Enbridge.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">British Columbia's energy regulator says it will introduce as soon as April timelines for cleaning up thousands of dormant oil and gas wells as the province seeks to head off growing financial and environmental risks posed by the uneconomic sites.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The commitment is a first among Canada's western provinces and represents a major rewrite of current rules under which idle wells can languish indefinitely. Premier John Horgan's NDP government had introduced legislation in May giving the BC Oil and Gas Commission (BCOGC) powers to establish timelines, but the regulator is only now saying when they will take effect.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The move follows a six-month Globe and Mail investigation, published in November, that found that 7,382 wells – or a third of all wells in the province – are inactive, and that the number of defunct wells (those with no legal owner, also known as orphans) has swelled to 294, up from just 24 in 2014. The inactive sites represent a fraction of the 122,456 inactive wells tallied by The Globe and Mail across B.C., Saskatchewan and Alberta.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Such wells no longer produce oil and gas, but they have not been plugged. Thousands more have been abandoned, meaning they have been sealed but the surrounding land has not yet been restored to its predrilling state.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">BCOGC chief executive Paul Jeakins told The Globe new regulations would be in place by next May. However, he would not discuss specifics – such as how stringent the timelines will be, or what penalties would apply should companies fail to meet the toughened standards.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He also said companies would have flexibility to propose alternative cleanup plans, so long as the work is done in a timely way.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, the intent is to reduce a glut of inactive sites before they become a financial burden for the wider industry – and potentially taxpayers – should an operator fail. “What we're looking at is how do we put in place an accelerated timeline for industry to actually restore those sites, so not just leave it open-ended, which is what it was before," Mr. Jeakins said in an interview.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The goal is to “actually close that loop now so that they've got a timeline that we dictate to them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And then we also can prevent operators that have got a history of insolvency from operating in B.C.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So it's a bit of a one-two punch."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">All three western provinces have struggled as the number of inactive sites and those with no legal owner have spiked through the industry-wide downturn in oil and natural gas prices. Adding to the strain is a brisk trade detailed by The Globe in which major companies routinely offload properties saddled with hefty cleanup obligations onto smaller players with scant ability to pay for remediation, despite regulations meant to prevent such deals.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Alberta, the backlog of inactive wells has soared to 89,217 and a string of corporate bankruptcies has pushed the number of defunct well sites to 4,349, up from 545 in 2014, necessitating a $235million loan from the provincial government to shore up funds set aside by the industry for cleanup.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Energy Minister Margaret McCuaig-Boyd has said Alberta's NDP government is studying timelines and targets to reduce the growing inventory of dormant sites. But it's unclear how stringent any new rules will be nor when they will be introduced. The Alberta Energy Regulator has refused to comment on the issue and on Thursday referred questions about potential changes to the minister's office, which provided no further details.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">B.C.'s commitment comes as the energy industry gears up for major expansion in the province, buoyed by <span class="companylink">Royal Dutch Shell</span>'s $40-billion plan to drill and export natural gas in liquid form from the northern coast.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Jeakins said the regulator is taking a harder look at permit transfers between companies to ensure major producers don't offload liabilities onto smaller players that cannot pay for well abandonment and cleanup. That includes assessing how much debt a purchaser is carrying when it acquires wells, its ability to raise money in the market and whether or not the wells being transferred are still economic.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Industry groups had lobbied against hard timelines for cleaning up inactive sites, saying the sector cannot afford increased costs at a time even large companies are struggling with volatile prices and export bottlenecks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Jeakins said the regulator's data show only a fraction of inactive wells in B.C. are ever revived.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Globe's own analysis found that wells languished even when commodity prices were much higher than today's levels. Nearly one-fifth of inactive wells in Alberta and roughly 10 per cent each in B.C. and Saskatchewan have been idle for 10 or more years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“If somebody really wants to think that they're coming back into an area, they can certainly show us what that's going to look like, but it's not to get around the timelines," he said. “We've got a fairly sophisticated group here that can look at the likelihood just as easy as their geologists and reservoir engineers. So I'm not worried that they're going to pull a fast one on us."</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Premier Rachel Notley says her recent decision to cut oil production seems to be working.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And in a speech to northern Alberta leaders Thursday she also served up a little yuletide jab at the prime minister.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It wasn't an easy decision," Notley said of the oil cut.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"But I believe that in the circumstances it was the right decision.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"At least so far we've seen the right result, but you never want to shut down production as an economic plan. It's counterintuitive. It's not a long-term solution."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Earlier this month, Notley ordered companies to cut production by almost nine per cent starting in the new year to close the price gap between Alberta oil and the North American benchmark.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That price gap was growing so wide that vast reserves of oil were building up in Alberta and the price was falling through the floor, leading to fears of massive job cuts and project closures.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The differential, which was over US$50 at one point, has bounced back in recent days and now trades at about US$25 less than the benchmark West Texas Intermediate price.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The oil cut program will exempt the first 10,000 barrels per day, to shield small producers. It will be reviewed monthly and is to end on Dec. 31, 2019.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Notley is also buying rail cars and continues to push Prime Minister Justin Trudeau for action to end the pipeline bottleneck, considered the primary culprit for the oil glut and low prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Alberta's long-term focus remains on the Trans Mountain pipeline expansion, to get more oil to the B.C. coast. The project was OK'd by Trudeau's government two years ago but is now in limbo as the feds respond to a Federal Court of Appeal decision that ordered a better examination of the impact on marine life and further consultation with affected First Nations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Notley has called on Trudeau to get Trans Mountain moving and also roll back on two bills now before Parliament - a northern B.C. coast tanker ban and changes to rules for energy megaprojects - which critics say will needlessly hamper energy development.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She has been critical of the federal government in recent days, particularly over Ottawa's resistance to join Alberta in purchasing extra rail cars.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Notley noted that Trudeau expressed concern earlier this week for Alberta's plight.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"He said his sympathy is with Alberta at Christmas because we're going through tough times," she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"'Quite the Christmas gift, his sympathy,'I thought to myself.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I truly hope that he got a gift receipt with that little Christmas gift because I would like to exchange it for a pipeline."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Notley also crossed swords this week with Quebec Premier François Legault.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Legault has said there is no social appetite in Quebec right now to accept "dirty energy" from Alberta. Notley responded Tuesday, saying Legault "needs to get off his high horse," examine the environmental changes Alberta has introduced, and remember that the revenue helps fund infrastructure nationwide.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Manitoba Premier Brian Pallister waded into that fight Thursday, criticizing the feds for sitting on the sidelines.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"For one province to say 'We don't want that dirty energy'when it's their principal import, and to have the federal government say nothing in response, tells you the level of dysfunction is dangerous right now in this country," said Pallister.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Their study, published in the December issue of International Journal of Greenhouse Gas Control[https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1750583618302755], found that hydrotalcites, a kind of mineral, can store carbon dioxide sucked out of the air, and safely keep it in crystal form.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Working with tailings from an old asbestos mine in New South Wales, she said researchers found that ultramafic rock, a magnesium-rich material often treated as waste, could trap atmospheric CO2 with a little help from the weather.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Rain water … is a little bit acidic, because carbon dioxide from the atmosphere naturally dissolves into it,” Wilson said. “It's kind of like carbonated fizzy water.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As rain water eats away at the some of this mine waste, she added, magnesium (a kind of metal), reacts with CO2 in the air to form hydrotalcite, a crystalline mineral capable of safely storing the greenhouse gas.</p>

Alberta project aims to both capture CO2 and boost oil output[https://www.thestar.com/calgary/2018/09/09/alberta-project-aims-to-both-capture-co2-and-boost-oil-output.html]
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Connor Turvey, lead author of paper, conducted the study under Wilson's supervision as a PhD student at <span class="companylink">Monash University</span> in Australia.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Compared to other methods of carbon sequestration, some of which involve capturing, compressing, and then injecting CO2 into underground, Turvey said the discovery could open door for cost-effective technologies for scrubbing the air of a greenhouse gas that contribute to climate change.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“If you have enough magnesium and enough CO2 in the water, these minerals can start to form naturally, he said. “Kind of like how salt crystals will eventually form out of salt water — this is kind of the same thing, but with a bunch of different elements instead.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Under the Paris Agreement, Canada has committed to help keep the average global temperature increase below 2 C. However, the latest report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate[https://www.ipcc.ch/sr15/chapter/summary-for-policy-makers/], found that limiting the increase to 1.5 C would go a long way to limiting some of the devastating effects of climate change, like declining of coral reefs, melting Arctic ice, and rising seas levels.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Reaching that goal would require a massive cut to human-caused greenhouse emissions — 45 per cent below 2010 levels by 2030 the report added — along with the use of carbon capture technology to pull CO2 out of the atmosphere.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“If we can encourage these minerals to form, they will form by pulling CO2 out of the atmosphere and then trapping it as a mineral, which means that it won't be able to negatively affect our atmosphere anymore,” Turvey said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On a smaller scale, the discovery can also offer mining operations the opportunity to offset their emissions by greening their waste sites, and turning them into assets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An added benefit is that the hydrotalcite crystals are fairly stable, and can securely hold on CO2 that might otherwise have detrimental effects on the environment, Turvey added.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“They're benign minerals,” he explained. “They should theoretically be quite safe to handle. As long as we don't go sticking them in a bunch of acid, they should just sit there safely over very long time scales.”</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CALGARY — It's unlikely a dramatic improvement in western Canadian oil prices since Alberta announced forced production curtailments two weeks ago will continue after the cuts begin on Jan. 1, a panel of experts agreed Thursday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The difference between Western Canadian Select bitumen-blend heavy oil and New York-traded West Texas Intermediate oil prices had widened to as much as US$52 a barrel in October before recovering to about US$25.50 on Dec. 3, the day after the announcement by Alberta Premier Rachel Notley.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The differential tightened to as little as US$10.25 on Tuesday this week and was flat at US$12.25 on Thursday for barrels to be delivered in January, according to Calgary trader Net Energy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That's actually slightly lower than what analysts consider a normal or typical discount based on transportation costs and the difference in quality between WCS and WTI.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I expect there's going to be a lot of variance in the short-term over the next couple of months where the price bumps around trying to seek what its natural level should be," said Kent Fellows, research associate in energy and environmental policy at the University of Calgary's School of Public Policy, after a panel discussion on the topic in downtown Calgary.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I would not expect the differential to stay as low as it was on Tuesday."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Audience member Gordon Tulk argued that Alberta has surrendered to pipeline opponents by reducing production and will be forced to extend cuts beyond the program's end date because the federal government's Bill C-69 to revamp the <span class="companylink">National Energy Board</span> will make it impossible to build new pipelines.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We are surrendering to the federal government and the powers that are pushing the federal government politically," he said later, adding the curtailments amount to the province "kneecapping" its own industry.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We've now put a ceiling on our production," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the panellists disagreed, with Trevor Tombe, assistant economics professor at the School of Public Policy, pointing out the province's goal is for a modest US$4 per barrel improvement in 2019 and it has set a firm end date of Dec. 31, 2019, for the curtailment program.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Curtailing forever makes no sense at all," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Curtailing to avoid shipping out on expensive transportation modes (like rail or truck) makes sense ... It's better not to ship today and ship tomorrow on a new pipeline."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Current prices in Western Canada are based on speculation about what the market will look like in January and that will change, said Grant Bishop, associate director of research for the C.D. Howe Institute.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He said it's unclear how much of the wide price differentials over the past several months was caused by flaws in the way Canada allocates tight pipeline space, for instance, adding those factors may continue to influence prices even as production falls.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Alberta is depending on the federal government to show more leadership on the pipeline file and clarify what Bill C-69 will look like when implemented, said panellist Marla Orenstein, natural resources director for the Canada West Foundation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Market access for Alberta crude is expected to improve when <span class="companylink">Enbridge Inc</span>.'s Line 3 replacement project starts up in late 2019. Two other pipelines, the Trans Mountain expansion and the Keystone XL project, are both in limbo after being stalled by court decisions in Canada and the U.S.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Crude-by-rail shipments reached a record high of 270,000 barrels per day in September. Tombe said predictions that they could grow to as much as 700,000 bpd next year are unlikely now because the production cuts will reduce the need.</p>

The take-or-pay agreement secures 70 mmcf per day of Montney gas for a 10-year term. The 200 mmcf per day Wapiti Gas Plant, which is expected to be operational in the first quarter of 2019, is now 95 percent contracted.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We are pleased to secure this long-term processing agreement that effectively fills SemCAMS Wapiti Gas Plant and helps ensure the plant will operate in the most efficient and cost effective manner,” said Dave Gosse, SemCAMS’ Vice President and General Manager. “This agreement underscores the need for our Wapiti Gas Plant and the unique services we are able to offer customers with our existing pipelines and sour gas processing plants. With the Wapiti plant essentially fully contracted, we are increasing our focus on the Pipestone area development and look forward to continuing our work with producers and the community to safely and efficiently develop the Montney formation.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the fall, SemCAMS received Alberta Energy Regulator approval to construct a 280 mmcf per day sour gas plant in the Pipestone area. The new plant will be connected to the Wapiti Gas Plant via the Pipestone pipeline, which is currently under construction and is expected to begin gathering gas from the Pipestone area in the fourth quarter of 2019. The pipeline is designed to provide operational synergies and efficiencies to both the Wapiti plant and the Pipestone plant through SemCAMS integrated pipeline and gas plant system.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As in previous months, we see a fair amount of continuity. A majority of the companies on the table this month appeared on previous months’ tables. Many of them were discussed in previous updates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">Maxar Technologies Ltd</span>., a provider of satellite communication services, remains near the top of the table, but it experienced a doubling of insider buying during the past month. On the other hand, the chief operating officer recently resigned and activist short seller Spruce Point Capital Management reiterated its bearish views on Dec. 11.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another noticeable uptick in insider buying over the past month occurred for excavation-specialist <span class="companylink">Badger Daylighting Ltd</span>. The company produced strong financial results in recent quarters and its stock has appreciated by nearly a third since late October.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mortgage-insurer Genworth MI Canada Inc. had a substantial rise in insider selling. Downside risks are global trade uncertainty, oil price weakness and auto sector layoffs. And higher interest rates could trigger more mortgage delinquencies. However, yields on U.S. 10-year Treasury bonds have lately been trending down, from 3.25 per cent to 2.85 percent since early October.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A notable new entry on the table is <span class="companylink">Franco-Nevada Corp</span>., which provides financing to gold miners in return for royalties and income streams. It leaped onto the table into the third spot with 17.5 per cent of outstanding shares sold short.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It would take a long time (64 days) for <span class="companylink">Franco-Nevada</span>’s short sellers to close their positions at current daily trading volumes, so the risk of a short-covering rally is present. However, insiders have sold more than $14-million worth of stock over the past 12 months, which reinforces the bearish signal of the large short position.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Management issued one news release during the past month, disclosing that the <span class="companylink">Canada Revenue Agency</span> had expanded its audit of the company’s 2012 to 2015 taxation years – and could expand it further. The company doesn’t have any convertible debt that short sellers might be arbitraging.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A November research report issued by <span class="companylink">TD Securities</span> lowered the brokerage’s target price on the shares of <span class="companylink">Franco Nevada</span>. A main reason was: “That the precious metal streaming business is in a period of hiatus … producers have not yet entered the project-building phase that would require raising funds via stream sales.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">Aphria Inc</span>. is also new to the table, although it did appear at times on the most expensive stocks to borrow table in 2018. Quintessential Capital Management and Hindenburg Research recently issued a report alleging the company engaged in purchases of "virtually worthless corporate entities” associated with company insiders.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The next table highlights the largest increases in the percentage of shares short for companies with market capitalizations greater than $500 million. <span class="companylink">Franco-Nevada Corp</span>. is at the top, and was discussed above. Second highest was <span class="companylink">Canadian Utilities Ltd</span>., a provider of gas and electricity services.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The top two positions on the above table went to gold mining companies. A factor here could be strength in the U.S. dollar in 2018. Since it is the currency that the price of gold is quoted internationally, dollar strength makes it harder for non-U.S. citizens to buy gold.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Earlier in 2018, this table was filled with a lot of marijuana companies, nearly half of the entries at one point. The numbers dwindled as the year progressed but this month, there was a jump up, to 8 companies. <span class="companylink">Tilray Inc</span>., based in Nanaimo, B.C., would have been the 9th marijuana company if it was listed on an exchange in Canada instead of in the United States (indeed, it would have been at the top given borrowing rates for its shares are close to 100 per cent).</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Company previously provided guidance that the Bowden project capex was estimated at $119 million. PCL, our Engineering, Procurement and Construction (“EPC”) contractor, presented the Company with an updated firm contract price proposal which outlines a project capex of $114,813,058. This is an estimated $5.2 million improvement over budget estimates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Company President & COO Gordon Driedger stated, “The support shown by our EPC partner is impressive. PCL worked directly with our engineering team during development of FEED documentation resulting in a more thorough understanding of project scope. As a result, we have improved project costing, and this will lead to improved project economics. With this added degree of price certainty, we look forward to initiating final engineering, fabrication and onsite construction in 2019.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">PCL’s chief operating officer, PCL Heavy Industrial, Roger Keglowitsch stated, “Strong collaboration between Gen III, PCL, and the engineers during the FEED development process validated the scope and understanding of the project, and this was key in allowing PCL to develop a price that brings certainty. We’re excited to continue working alongside Gen III as we advance the Bowden project into 2019.”</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Wall Street futures edged higher early Thursday on further hints that trade tensions between the United States and China are easing. World stocks rose for a third session as the <span class="companylink">European Central Bank</span> held rates steady and reaffirmed the end of its quantitative easing program. In this country, Bay Street futures edged up with crude prices relatively steady following figures showing a drop in U.S. inventories last week.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Major markets in Europe started the day mixed ahead of the <span class="companylink">ECB</span> decision. Markets in Asia finished higher after a positive day on Wall Street on Tuesday. Trade continues to be at the forefront. A Reuters report that Chinese state-owned companies have bought more than 1.5 million tonnes of soybeans, marking the first big purchase in six months helped bolster sentiment. The purchases are seen as supporting positive developments early this month when U.S. President Donald Trump met with Chinese leader Xi Jinping and struck a 90-day trade truce.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Reports that China is making good on pledges made with Trump at the G20 are helping markets become slowly less pessimistic over U..S – Sino relations,” Jasper Lawler, head of research at <span class="companylink">London Capital Group</span>, said. “And that increases expectations of a trade deal being reached within the 90 day time frame.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, he said, investors remain cautions because “they have seen progress before only for relations to take a sudden turn for the worse. This caution is being reflected in a mixed start for Europe after US markets closed positive, but well off their high,” he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On the <span class="companylink">ECB</span>, the central bank, as expected, said it will end its crisis era bond-buying program at the end of this month but will keep reinvesting money from maturing bonds “for an extended period of time past the date when it starts raising the key <span class="companylink">ECB</span> interest rates, and in any case for as long as necessary.” The bank launched its quantitative easing program four years ago to support economic growth in the euro zone and bolster inflation. The <span class="companylink">ECB</span> also kept its key rate on hold and said it expects the key <span class="companylink">ECB</span> interest rates “to remain at their present levels at least through the summer of 2019.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Bay Street, investors get a handful of earnings. Sobeys-owner Empire Co. Ltd. reported its latest results before the start of trading. In the latest quarter, the grocer reported adjusted earnings per share of 40 cents up from 27 cents a year earlier. The latest quarter beat analysts' forecasts, which called for adjusted earnings per share of about 32 cents. Same-store sales - excluding fuel sales - rose 2.5 per cent. Excluding pharmacy sales, same-store sales were up 3 per cent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">Davidstea Inc</span>. and <span class="companylink">Transat AT Inc</span>. also report.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Overseas, European markets were mixed with the pan-European STOXX 600 edging down 0.05 per cent. Britain’s FTSE 100 slid 0.14 per cent. Germany’s DAX rose 0.23 per cent and France’s CAC added 0.04 per cent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Asia, markets finished higher on easing trade concerns. The Shanghai Composite Index rose 1.23 per cent. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng gained 1.29 per cent. In Japan, the Nikkei added 0.99 per cent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Commodities</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Crude prices were little changed ahead of the North American open with a report showing a draw in U.S. inventories helping offset global concerns about market oversupply. Brent crude was trading in a day range of US$59.70 to US$60.59. The range on West Texas Intermediate was US$50.78 to US$51.57.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Figures released Tuesday by the <span class="companylink">U.S. Energy Information Administration</span> fell by 1.2 million barrels last week. That was below market expectations, which had called for a decrease of 3 million barrels, but it also came on the heels of a similar report from the <span class="companylink">American Petroleum Institute</span> earlier in the week which also showed a draw down in inventories.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, the Paris-based <span class="companylink">International Energy Agency</span> forecasts that world crude supplies could move into a deficit sooner than expected, helped by a planned production cut by <span class="companylink">OPEC</span> and its allies as well as a decision by Alberta to reduce output in the new year. In an earlier report, the IEA said it expected the world oil market to remain in surplus through much of next year. However, in its latest report, the agency says it now expects to see a deficit in the second quarter, if <span class="companylink">OPEC</span> holds to its agreement to cut production by 1.2 million barrels a day.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Oil prices have steadied overnight, under pressure from high inventories, but supported by a draw down in U.S. crude inventories and on signs that the Sino-U.S trade war may be easing,” <span class="companylink">OANDA</span> analyst Dean Popplewell said. “Global supply of the ‘black stuff’ has outstripped demand over the last two quarters, inflating inventories and pushing crude prices to its lowest level in 12-months at the end of November.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In other commodities, gold prices slipped as the U.S. dollar steadied and world stocks rose. Spot gold eased 0.3 per cent to US$1,241.50 per ounce by midmorning in Europe, while U.S. gold futures were down 0.3 per cent at US$1,245.80 per ounce.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“With equities rebounding this week, gold has fallen slightly out of favour as traders unwound their safe haven bets,” Fawad Razaqzada, an analyst with <span class="companylink">Forex.com</span>, told Reuters.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Silver prices were also down modestly while platinum prices edged higher.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Currencies</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Canadian dollar was slightly weaker as its U.S. counterpart steadied against a basket of world currencies. The day range on the loonie so far 74.79 US cents to 74.94 US cents. Last week, the loonie hit its lowest level in 18 months after the <span class="companylink">Bank of Canada</span> hinted that interest rates may not increase as quickly as the markets had been expecting in the new year. However, this week, the Canadian dollar has seen some support from firmer crude prices. Elsa Lignos, RBC’s global head of FX strategy, also said in an early note that a rally in equity markets has helped boost sentiment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In other currencies, the U.S. dollar index was off 0.1 per cent at 96.945. The euro was slightly higher after Italy said it would cut its budgetary spending plans, heading off a showdown with the <span class="companylink">European Union</span>. The euro rose 0.2 per cent to US$1.1394. The single currency has largely traded in a US$1.16 and US$1.12 range since August, according to Reuters figures.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Despite markets having priced out a lot in the way of <span class="companylink">ECB</span> hikes in recent weeks, recent comments from [ECB chief economist] Peter Praet and President Draghi suggest that the <span class="companylink">ECB</span> is prepared to ‘look through’ the weakness of euro area growth in Q3,” Ms. Lignos said. “The <span class="companylink">ECB</span> continues to reassure itself that the resilience of domestic demand means that the euro area should be able to produce growth around trend over coming years, sufficient in the face of a tightening labour market to justify a normalization of policy.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The British pound rallied ahead of confidence vote for Prime Minister Theresa May but held relatively steady after she won the ballot and moved in a fairly narrow margin following the win as stiff opposition to her Brexit agreement remains.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In bonds, the yield on the U.S. 10-year note was lower at 2.897 per cent. The yield on the 30-year note was also lower at 3.14 per cent.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">TORONTO, Dec. 13, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Despite a potential slowdown in the Canadian economy over the next year, the Canadian consumer credit market is expected to see continued growth in consumer-level debt and no significant increases in delinquency rates. The just-released <span class="companylink">TransUnion</span> (NYSE: TRU) Canada Industry Insights Report[https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=2ZV-lAFCTdnmO6vKkbAw6G4xW2NM0JcZVuNMm0-4A1IIoMduFdwzm5gSZLhtFo-ZxZCt76e0X5Fu7YP5N8XwHqZHMhcbC37zUAbNx2v2tmIjsDGSH3pO0NTPN9VHjunqOkGF_IfLZUecr_vPe9BY0g==] includes the latest data for the third quarter of 2018 as well as a forecast for 2019. <span class="companylink">TransUnion</span> projects that average consumer debt balances will continue to increase for Canadians across mortgage, credit card and other non-mortgage related debt through 2019 and that serious delinquency rates will either decline or remain steady over the next year.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The continued low delinquency environment portends a healthy consumer credit market within the current economic climate. However, a potential slowdown in the Canadian economy in 2019, combined with soft wage growth, heightened uncertainty beyond Canadian borders and continued interest rate increases may cause some challenges. Canada’s GDP growth is widely expected to slow from an expected 2.2% in 2018 to 1.9% in 2019 (Source: Oxford Economics). This slowdown in economic activity may impact consumer spending and employment levels, which could put stress on consumers’ capacity to service debt. At this time, none of these factors are significant enough to negatively impact the outlook for the consumer credit market in 2019.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The Canadian consumer credit market has performed extremely well over the past several years, with solid growth supported by strong economic fundamentals,” said Matt Fabian, Director of Financial Services Research and Consulting for TransUnion Canada. “Looking into 2019, we anticipate a continuation of these positive trends, which is good news for Canadian credit consumers. However, there are signals of a mild economic slowdown emerging, which presents an opportunity for Canadian consumers and businesses to plan and evaluate different potential scenarios that could impact their ability to continue to responsibly manage their debt.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Year Ahead: 2019 Forecast</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">TransUnion</span>’s forecasting models provide forward-looking insights for consumer credit balances and delinquency rates, and incorporate dozens of credit, behavioural and macroeconomic variables. The 2019 forecast indicates that the outlook remains positive for the Canadian credit market, with continued opportunities for growth and balanced risk despite some potential economic challenges.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the conclusion of 2019, <span class="companylink">TransUnion</span> is forecasting that the average mortgage balance will increase by 3.4% over the forecasted year-end 2018 level to $274,533, and average non-mortgage debt balances will reach $30,687, a 2.8% annual increase. Serious delinquency rates are forecasted to decline or remain steady for most credit products.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">* Serious delinquency rates are consumer level and are measured as 60 or more days past due for mortgage and 90 or more days past due for all other products</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Trends to Watch in 2019</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">1) Credit card delinquency rates at higher risk of an increaseCredit cards are the one major credit product that is forecast to have a slight increase in delinquency rates in 2019, with other products expected to have lower delinquency rates. <span class="companylink">TransUnion</span> research studies have shown that, when faced with economic pressure, consumers often have a hierarchy around which debt payments they continue to stay current on and which they allow to go delinquent. The analysis shows that, for consumers with credit cards, auto loans and mortgages all in their wallets, credit card payments are generally the first product type that consumers will go delinquent on, preferring to keep payments like auto loans and mortgages in good standing if they are forced to choose. While Canada is not expected to slip into a recession in 2019, any significant economic headwinds would likely put credit cards at a higher risk for increased delinquency rates relative to other major credit products.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Consumers’ ability to manage their debt is directly impacted by their disposable income,” said Fabian. “If we were to see an economic downturn and pressures on consumer income, we would anticipate credit cards to be the product that would be impacted first in terms of higher delinquencies. At the same time, we would expect balances to rise as consumers look to cards to help make ends meet. While current expectations are for continued positive economic growth in 2019, lenders are likely to monitor their portfolios closely in the event of any negative news."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">2) Potential for regional shocks across CanadaTransUnion forecasts the possibility for regional economic shocks across Canada contributing to a slight rise in overall delinquency. These include the impact of steel and aluminum tariffs on manufacturing, continued decline in oil prices and overall industry disruption such as the recent news of the <span class="companylink">General Motors</span> plant closure in Oshawa.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“While we see the impact of tariffs and localized shocks as having very little impact on overall delinquency across Canada, it would certainly be felt by consumers in those regions and some consumer credit portfolios may be regionally impacted,” said Fabian. “Depending on the severity and length of the oil price decline, some regions could experience delinquency rate increases of up to 50 bps, similar to what occurred in Alberta and Saskatchewan following the last oil price drop. Typically, as these economic shock events occur, we tend to see some unemployment increases lagged by a rise in delinquency as incomes and capacity to service debt are constrained.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">3) Mortgage balances to slightly increaseStricter mortgage qualifying rules and stress tests have been successful in tightening entry into the mortgage market for many consumers over the past 12 months. As both consumers and lenders continue to navigate the new environment, <span class="companylink">TransUnion</span> forecasts a slight increase in average mortgage balance per consumer, with new mortgage origination amounts reflecting the still-elevated home prices in many major metropolitan areas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The tighter mortgage rules will likely have some positive impact on rising delinquency rates when Canada faces the next economic downturn. Given that the Canadian market already enjoys very low delinquency in the mortgage space, the stress testing rules should help bolster this and reduce the impact of any shock,” Said Fabian.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">4) Non-mortgage delinquency will continue to dropA decrease in overall consumer non-mortgage delinquency is expected to persist through 2019 as consumers continue to do a good job of managing their credit obligations. But delinquency rates are sensitive to economic events including, but not limited to, interest rates, unemployment, inflation and wage growth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Core economic fundamentals are likely to remain relatively stable through the coming year, and we predict this will have a correspondingly positive impact on delinquency levels,” said Fabian. “Additionally, when we look at consumer payment patterns – particularly the ratio of how much consumers with a credit card balance are paying off in addition to their minimum required payments, we continue to see a healthy positive spread, which indicates that most Canadian consumers have some excess capacity to absorb shock.”</p>
