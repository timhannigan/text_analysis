The Company's Management's Discussion and Analysis ("MD&A") and interim consolidated financial statements dated as at and for the period ended September 30, 2018 are available on SEDAR (the System for Electronic Document Analysis and Retrieval) at</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In response to the commodity price outlook for natural gas, the Company set out in 2018 to improve its financial position and to increase its light oil weighting in order to increase funds flow per share. In the first half of 2018 the Company directed excess funds flow to debt repayment, targeting debt reduction of $10 to $15 million. In the first nine months of 2018, Petrus has reduced its net debt(1) by $16.5 million or 11%. The second element of the Company's 2018 plan targeted to drill Cardium light oil wells in Ferrier with budgeted capital of $25 to $30 million. The Company's development program recommenced during the third quarter as planned and Petrus drilled 5 (2.9 net) wells during the second half of 2018. The Company expects the remaining capital program will be funded by funds flow and working capital and is targeting to end 2018 with net debt(1) no greater than $135 million(2).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">HIGHLIGHTS</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">* Petrus generated funds flow of $7.7 million in the third quarter of 2018 which is consistent with the $7.7 million generated in the third quarter of 2017. The quarterly average light oil price (Edm CAD$) increased 40% from the prior year which offset the impact of 34% reduced natural gas prices (AECO 7A monthly index) from the prior year. Approximately 70% of the Company's third quarter light oil production was Canadian Condensate. The Canadian Condensate price differential to WTI (C$) was $4.76/bbl whereas the Edmonton Light differential to WTI (C$) was $15.15/bbl for the third quarter of 2018. During the quarter the Company optimized its natural gas production which resulted in an 18% increase from the prior year in its total liquids weighting which helped to further offset the impact of reduced natural gas pricing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">* The Company has strategically focused on debt repayment in 2018 and has reduced net debt(1) by $16.5 million or 11% since December 31, 2017. As a result of the current commodity price environment, Petrus continues to focus on Cardium light oil development in Ferrier. Capital investment resumed in August and the Company drilled 5 (2.9 net) wells during the second half of 2018. The completion operations for these wells commenced in early November and the wells are expected to be on stream by year end(2).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">* Third quarter average production was 8,338 boe/d in 2018 compared to 10,567 boe/d for the same period in 2017. The 21% decrease is due to certain dry gas production in the Foothills area which was shut-in due to uneconomic gas prices. The production decrease is also attributable to natural production declines. Petrus strategically deferred its capital development until the second half of 2018 in order to permit debt repayment early in the year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">* Total operating expenses for the third quarter were 9% lower at $4.95 per boe in 2018 compared to $5.42 per boe in 2017 (3). The Company continues to focus on optimizing its cost structure, particularly in the Ferrier area, through facility ownership and control.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">* The 2018 semi-annual review of the Company's Revolving Credit Facility ("RCF") has been completed and the RCF syndicate of lenders maintained the Company's borrowing base at $110 million. The Company's $35 million second lien term loan ("Term Loan") also remains unchanged following the semi-annual RCF review. The Term Loan is due October 8, 2020 and bears interest at the Canadian Dealer Offered Rate (CDOR) plus 700 basis points.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">* Petrus utilizes financial derivative contracts to mitigate commodity price risk and provide stability and sustainability to the Company's economic returns, funds flow and capital development plan. During the third quarter, the Company recognized a $2.4 million ($3.18 per boe) realized gain related to natural gas, offset by a $4.5 million ($5.87 per boe) realized loss related to light oil. As a percentage of third quarter 2018 production, Petrus has derivative contracts in place for 71% at an average price of $2.49/mcf and 62% at an average price of $66.80/bbl of its natural gas and oil and natural gas liquids production, respectively, for the remainder of 2018.

The 21% decrease is due to certain dry gas production in the Foothills area which was shut-in due to uneconomic gas prices. The production decrease is also attributable to natural production declines.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CapitalDevelopment(1)In response to the commodity price outlook for natural gas, the Company set out in 2018 to improve its financial position and direct excess funds flow to debt repayment, targeting debt reduction of $10 to $15 million. In the first nine months of 2018, Petrus reduced its net debt by $16.5 million or 11%. The second element of the Company's 2018 plan targeted to drill Cardium light oil wells in Ferrier with budgeted capital of $25 to $30 million. The Company's development program recommenced during the third quarter as planned and total capital invested in the first nine months of 2018 has been $11.5 million. Petrus drilled 5 (2.9 net) wells during the second half of 2018 for a total of 7 (3.6 net) drilled or participated in to date in 2018. The completion operations for the 5 recent wells commenced in early November and the wells are expected to be on stream by year end(2). The Company expects that the remaining capital program will be funded by funds flow and working capital.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Production OptimizationDuring the third quarter, Petrus initiated additional deep cut processing of certain natural gas production in order to increase its natural gas liquids yield. In the current commodity price environment, the increased NGL yield optimizes the netback. Petrus' total liquids production increased from 29% in the second quarter of 2018 to 33% in the third quarter of 2018 despite no new oil production brought on stream.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CREDIT FACILITY UPDATE</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 2018 semi-annual review of the Company's Revolving Credit Facility ("RCF") has been completed and the RCF syndicate of lenders maintained the Company's borrowing base at $110 million. The Company's $35 million second lien term loan ("Term Loan") also remains unchanged following the semi-annual RCF review. The Term Loan is due October 8, 2020 and bears interest at the Canadian Dealer Offered Rate (CDOR) plus 700 basis points. The average Term Loan interest rate for the third quarter of 2018 was 8.8%.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This press release makes reference to the terms "operating netback", "corporate netback", and "net debt". These indicators are not recognized measures under GAAP (IFRS) and do not have a standardized meaning prescribed by GAAP (IFRS). Accordingly, the Company's use of these terms may not be comparable to similarly defined measures presented by other companies. Management uses these terms for the reasons set forth below.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">OperatingNetbackOperating netback is a common non-GAAP financial measure used in the oil and gas industry which is a useful supplemental measure to evaluate the specific operating performance by product at the oil and gas lease level. The most directly comparable GAAP measure to operating netback is funds flow. Operating netback is calculated as oil and natural gas revenue less royalties, operating and transportation expenses. It is presented on an absolute value and per unit basis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CorporateNetbackCorporate netback is also a common non-GAAP financial measure used in the oil and gas industry which evaluates the Company’s profitability at the corporate level. Management believes corporate netback provides information to assist a reader in understanding the Company's profitability relative to current commodity prices. It is calculated as the operating netback less general and administrative expense, finance expense, decommissioning expenditures, plus the net realized gain (loss) on financial derivatives. It is presented on an absolute value and per unit basis. The most directly comparable GAAP measure to corporate netback is funds flow.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NetDebtNet debt is a non-GAAP financial measure and is calculated as current assets (excluding unrealized financial derivative assets) less current liabilities (excluding unrealized financial derivative liabilities) and long term debt. Petrus uses net debt as a key indicator of its leverage and strength of its balance sheet. There is no GAAP measure that is reasonably comparable to net debt.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">ADVISORIES</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">BasisofPresentationFinancial data presented above has largely been derived from the Company’s financial statements, prepared in accordance with GAAP which require publicly accountable enterprises to prepare their financial statements using IFRS. Accounting policies adopted by the Company are set out in the notes to the audited financial statements as at and for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017. The reporting and the measurement currency is the Canadian dollar. All financial information is expressed in Canadian dollars, unless otherwise stated.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Forward-LookingStatementsCertain information regarding Petrus set forth in this press release contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of applicable securities law, that involve substantial known and unknown risks and uncertainties. The use of any of the words “anticipate”, “continue”, “estimate”, “expect”, “may”, “will”, “project”, “should”, “believe” and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements. Such statements represent Petrus’ internal projections, estimates or beliefs concerning, among other things, an outlook on the estimated amounts and timing of capital investment, anticipated future debt, production, revenues or other expectations, beliefs, plans, objectives, assumptions, intentions or statements about future events or performance. These statements are only predictions and actual events or results may differ materially. Although Petrus believes that the expectations reflected in the forward-looking statements are reasonable, it cannot guarantee future results, levels of activity, performance or achievement since such expectations are inherently subject to significant business, economic, competitive, political and social uncertainties and contingencies. Many factors could cause Petrus’ actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in any forward-looking statements made by, or on behalf of, Petrus.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In particular, forward-looking statements included in this press release include, but are not limited to, expectations regarding the focus of and timing of capital expenditures; Petrus' drilling program and the timing for bringing wells on stream; expected year end 2018 net debt; the performance characteristics of the Company’s crude oil, NGL and natural gas properties including estimated production; crude oil, NGL and natural gas production levels and product mix; the availability of funds flow; sources of funding for capital expenditures; the use of funds flow and available credit facilities to address working capital deficiency; the growth of Petrus and the availability of the full amount of the revolving credit facility; the treatment of the revolving credit facility following the end of the revolving period; Petrus' ability to fund its financial liabilities; the size of, and future net revenues from, crude oil, NGL (natural gas liquids) and natural gas reserves; future prospects; expectations regarding the ability to raise capital and to continually add to reserves through acquisitions and development; access to debt and equity markets; projections of market prices and costs; Petrus’ future operating and financial results; supply and demand for crude oil, NGL and natural gas; future royalty rates; drilling, development and completion plans and the results therefrom; and treatment under governmental regulatory regimes and tax laws. In addition, statements relating to "reserves" are deemed to be forward-looking statements, as they involve the implied assessment, based on certain estimates and assumptions, that the reserves described can be profitably produced in the future.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These forward-looking statements are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, most of which are beyond the Company’s control, including the impact of general economic conditions; volatility in market prices for crude oil, NGL and natural gas; industry conditions; currency fluctuation; imprecision of reserve estimates; liabilities inherent in crude oil and natural gas operations; environmental risks; incorrect assessments of the value of acquisitions and exploration and development programs; competition; the lack of availability of qualified personnel or management; changes in income tax laws or changes in tax laws and incentive programs relating to the oil and gas industry; hazards such as fire, explosion, blowouts, cratering, and spills, each of which could result in substantial damage to wells, production facilities, other property and the environment or in personal injury; stock market volatility; ability to access sufficient capital from internal and external sources; completion of the financing on the timing planned and the receipt of applicable approvals; and the other risks. With respect to forward-looking statements contained in this press release, Petrus has made assumptions regarding: future commodity prices and royalty regimes; availability of skilled labour; timing and amount of capital expenditures; future exchange rates; the impact of increasing competition; conditions in general economic and financial markets; availability of drilling and related equipment and services; effects of regulation by governmental agencies; and future operating costs. Management has included the above summary of assumptions and risks related to forward- looking information provided in this press release in order to provide shareholders with a more complete perspective on Petrus’ future operations and such information may not be appropriate for other purposes. Petrus’ actual results, performance or achievement could differ materially from those expressed in, or implied by, these forward-looking statements and, accordingly, no assurance can be given that any of the events anticipated by the forward-looking statements will transpire or occur, or if any of them do so, what benefits that the Company will derive therefrom. Readers are cautioned that the foregoing lists of factors are not exhaustive.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These forward-looking statements are made as of the date of this press release and the Company disclaims any intent or obligation to update any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or results or otherwise, other than as required by applicable securities laws.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">BOEPresentationThe oil and natural gas industry commonly expresses production volumes and reserves on a barrel of oil equivalent (“boe”) basis whereby natural gas volumes are converted at the ratio of six thousand cubic feet to one barrel of oil. The intention is to sum oil and natural gas measurement units into one basis for improved measurement of results and comparisons with other industry participants. Petrus uses the 6:1 boe measure which is the approximate energy equivalence of the two commodities at the burner tip. Boe’s do not represent an economic value equivalence at the wellhead and therefore may be a misleading measure if used in isolation.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">1) Refer to "Non-IFRS measures".</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">GUIDANCE REVISION</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Company is updating its previous annual average production guidance from 5,000 boepd to 4,850 boepd, and reducing capital to $38 million. The lower production and capital spending guidance is a direct result of the significant decrease in realized light oil prices in Q4 2018. Although the prevalent American and International light oil benchmarks have remained relatively strong, the near term outlook for Canadian light oil differentials is challenging.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Company’s general view is that the Canadian light oil differentials will tighten in the coming months and quarters. Notwithstanding the foregoing, for the interim period to protect stakeholder value, we have taken the following actions:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">* Reducing capital spending in Q4 to non-discretionary abandonment and decommissioning, along with select pipeline work, residual expenditures on the natural gas power generation and field information technology projects, and minor land and equipment purchases.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">* Enhanced hydrocarbon management, including amongst other activities utilizing existing storage and recommissioning tanks to allow for deferred sales of produced light oil. Razor has approximately 50,000 bbls of available surface storage.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">* Curtailing workover spending on wells requiring repair or optimization work. EXECUTIVE APPOINTMENT</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Company is excited to announce the appointment of Marc Bergevin as Vice President, Engineering. Mr Bergevin is a professional engineer with 23 years of experience in Western Canada and the international arena. Mr. Bergevin has a strong background in reservoir, exploitation and development engineering all leading to extracting more oil from the reservoir. Mr. Bergevin began his career at <span class="companylink">Talisman Energy</span> and has progressed through roles of increasing technical and managerial responsibility with <span class="companylink">Shell Canada</span>, <span class="companylink">EnCana</span>/Cenovus, PennWest and Cardinal Energy. Mr. Bergevin is a member of APEGA. Mr. Bergevin will be integral in the continued development and exploitation of Razor’s extensive light oil fields.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">OPERATIONAL UPDATE</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Razor's production during the third quarter of 2018 averaged 5,260 boepd, of which approximately 86% was light oil and NGLs. Production for the third quarter of 2018 increased 25% from the same period in 2017 due to the Kaybob acquisitions, along with general reactivation and optimization activities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">During the third quarter of 2018, the Company realized an average operating netback of $10.98/boe up 145% from the same quarter last year, due to higher realized prices partially offset by higher royalties and operating costs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Royalty rates averaged 23% in the third quarter of 2018, compared to 19% for the same period in 2017. The increase in royalty is due to the increase in realized oil sales prices in Q3 2018 over Q3 2017.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Operating expenses increased 11% in the third quarter of 2018 compared to the same period in 2017, mostly due to increased workover activity. Workovers and facility and pipeline integrity expenses averaged $9.26/boe in the third quarter of 2018 compared to $5.99/boe in 2017. During the third quarter of 2018, workovers consisted of production maintenance activities on 36 gross (16.8 net) wells. In addition, the Company also conducted pipeline integrity repairs and plant repairs in the quarter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The top cost drivers, fuel and electricity, labour, property taxes, and repairs and workovers, accounted for 77% of total operating expenses in the third quarter of 2018 (2017 - 70%). Electricity and fuel increased 41% in Q3 2018 from Q3 2017 mostly due to a 122% increase in electricity average pool prices and fluid volumes, offset by decreased electricity usage as a result of the installation of natural gas power generation on site. Pipeline and facility repairs and workovers increased 90% in Q3 2018 from Q3 2017 accounting for 28% of operating expenses in the third quarter, up from 20% in the same period last year, mostly due to increased well workover activity and increased pipeline integrity work.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Management is focused on continuous improvement of operational efficiencies to drive down key cost drivers. Specifically, the Company installed natural gas power generators to reduce reliance on grid-based electricity. In addition, the Company is also working on electrical contract buydowns to align with current demand. Management anticipates that these activities have reduced operating expenses by $0.7 million or $1.49/boe in the third quarter of 2018 and should continue in Q4 2018. Upon improvement of oil price differentials, management intends to conduct various well reactivation projects to increase production which reduces the per boe impact of fixed operating costs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Net blending and processing income for the third quarter of 2018 increased significantly by 87% to $1.2 million compared to $0.7 million in the same period in 2017, mostly due to increased volumes and the optimization of the Company's blending facility. We expect net blending revenue to be down in Q4 2018 due to high light oil differentials.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CAPITAL PROGRAM</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">During the three months ended September 30, 2018, Razor invested $4.1 million on a combination of reactivations and the purchase and installation of the natural gas power generators and associated equipment. In the third quarter of 2018, the Company reactivated 3 gross (2.8 net) wells, resulting in 94 boepd of net additional production.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">ABANDONMENT, RECLAMATION, AND REMEDIATION EXPENDITURES</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Razor inherited decommissioning liabilities included in its Swan Hills and Kaybob acquisitions. As at April 1, 2018, the Company had 64 wells remaining in the Inactive Well Compliance Program that it needs to address before March 31, 2020. The Company continues to invest in end-of-life well and facility decommissioning. In Q3 2018, the Company spent $1.7 million on abandonment, reclamation, and remediation expenditures.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NORMAL COURSE ISSUER BID</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On September 13, 2018, Razor announced its intention to commence a new NCIB to repurchase up to 772,442 of its common shares in open market transactions on the TSXV, representing 5% of the outstanding common shares at September 13, 2018. The NCIB will expire no later than September 13, 2019. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018, the Company repurchased and canceled 318,700 of its common shares for $947 thousand (September 30, 2017 - 115,900 shares for $188 thousand).</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS: This press release may contain certain statements that may be deemed to be forward-looking statements. Such statements relate to possible future events, including, but not limited to, the Company’s objectives, reductions in operating costs, future revenues, the Company’s capital program, reactivation, workover, stimulation, water flood optimization and other activities, future rates of production, capital investments relating to the installation of natural gas power generation units, potential future land and other acquisitions or dispositions, anticipated abandonment, reclamation and remediation costs for 2018, projections relating to Canadian light oil differentials, common share buybacks, and maintaining the monthly dividend. All statements other than statements of historical fact may be forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are often, but not always, identified by the use of words such as “anticipate”, “believe”, "expect", “plan”, “estimate”, “potential”, “will”, “should”, “continue”, “may”, “objective” and similar expressions. The forward-looking statements are based on certain key expectations and assumptions made by the Company, including but not limited to expectations and assumptions concerning the availability of capital, current legislation, receipt of required regulatory approval, the success of future drilling and development activities, the performance of existing wells, the performance of new wells, the Company’s growth strategy, general economic conditions, availability of required equipment and services and prevailing commodity prices. Although the Company believes that the expectations and assumptions on which the forward-looking statements are based are reasonable, undue reliance should not be placed on the forward-looking statements because the Company can give no assurance that they will prove to be correct. Since forward-looking statements address future events and conditions, by their very nature they involve inherent risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially from those currently anticipated due to a number of factors and risks. These include, but are not limited to, risks associated with the oil and gas industry in general (e.g., operational risks in development, exploration and production; delays or changes in plans with respect to exploration or development projects or capital expenditures; as the uncertainty of reserve estimates; the uncertainty of estimates and projections relating to production, costs and expenses, and health, safety and environmental risks), commodity price and exchange rate fluctuations, changes in legislation affecting the oil and gas industry and uncertainties resulting from potential delays or changes in plans with respect to exploration or development projects or capital expenditures. Please refer to the risk factors identified in the annual information form and management discussion and analysis of the Company which is available on SEDAR at www.sedar.com[http://www.sedar.com]. The forward-looking statements contained in this press release are made as of the date hereof and the Company undertakes no obligation to update publicly or revise any forward-looking statements or information, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, unless so required by applicable securities laws.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NON-IFRS MEASURES: This press release contains the terms "funds flow", "adjusted funds flow", "net blending and processing income", "net debt", "operating netback" and "corporate netback", which do not have standardized meanings prescribed by International Financial Reporting Standards ("IFRS") and therefore may not be comparable with the calculation of similar measures by other companies. Funds flow represents cash flow from operating activities before changes in non-cash working capital. Adjusted funds flow represents cash flow from operating activities before changes in non-cash working capital and decommissioning obligation expenditures incurred. Management uses adjusted funds flow to analyze operating performance and leverage, and considers adjusted funds flow from operating activities to be a key measure as it demonstrates the Company's ability to generate cash necessary to fund future capital investments and repay debt. Net blending and processing income is calculated by adding blending and processing income and deducting blending and processing expense. Net blending and processing income may not be comparable to similar measures used by other companies. Net debt is calculated as the principal amount of long-term debt and lease obligation less working capital (or plus working capital deficiency), with working capital excluding mark-to-market risk management contracts. Management believes net debt is a useful supplemental measure of the total amount of current and long-term debt of the Company. Operating netback equals total petroleum and natural gas sales less royalties and operating costs calculated on a boe basis. Razor considers operating netback as an important measure to evaluate its operational performance as it demonstrates its field level profitability relative to current commodity prices. Corporate netback is calculated by deducting general & administration, acquisition and transaction costs, and interest from operating netback. Razor considers corporate netback as an important measure to evaluate its overall corporate performance.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">ADVISORY PRODUCTION INFORMATION: Unless otherwise indicated herein, all production information presented herein is presented on a gross basis, which is the Company's working interest prior to deduction of royalties and without including any royalty interests.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">BARRELS OF OIL EQUIVALENT: The term "boe" or barrels of oil equivalent may be misleading, particularly if used in isolation. A boe conversion ratio of six thousand cubic feet of natural gas to one barrel of oil equivalent (6 Mcf: 1 bbl) is based on an energy equivalency conversion method primarily applicable at the burner tip and does not represent a value equivalency at the wellhead. Additionally, given that the value ratio based on the current price of crude oil, as compared to natural gas, is significantly different from the energy equivalency of 6:1; utilizing a conversion ratio of 6:1 may be misleading as an indication of value.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">IMMIGRATION-TEEN VIDEO HEARINGS — The AP learns that the Trump administration is replacing in-person court hearings for some migrant teens with video sessions piped into courtrooms from shelters. The administration's goal for the unannounced pilot program is to speed the processing of a record 13,000 detained minors, but early sessions have had technical glitches and some advocates call the video hearings a rollback of due process.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CALGARY, Alberta, Nov. 08, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- <span class="companylink">Strad Energy Services Ltd</span>., (“Strad” or the “Company”), an industrial matting and equipment rentals company, today announced its financial results for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018. All amounts are stated in Canadian dollars unless otherwise noted.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">THIRD QUARTER SELECTED FINANCIAL AND OPERATIONAL HIGHLIGHTS:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">* Strad reported total revenue of $31.2 million as compared to $33.9 million in Q3 2017;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">* Third quarter net income improved to $0.9 million compared to net income of $0.6 million in Q3 2017;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">* Strad reported EBITDA(1,4) of $6.5 million as compared to $9.4 million in Q3 2017;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">* Earnings per share improved to $0.02 as compared to earnings per share of $0.01 during the same period in 2017;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">* Reduced funded debt(2) by 21% to $7.7 million at September 30, 2018, compared to $9.8 million at December 31, 2017. Funded debt(2) to covenant EBITDA(3) ratio was 0.4 : 1.0 at September 30, 2018;;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">* More than doubled the 2018 capital budget from $13.0 million to $28.5 million. The increase in the capital budget is to meet the expected demand for industrial matting projects in Canada and the U.S. for the remainder of 2018 and 2019;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">* Capital additions in the third quarter totaled $10.5 million focused on increasing the Company's matting fleet; and</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">* On October 2, 2018 the Company announced a change in the reportable segments from a geographical focus to two new segments focusing on Industrial Matting and Equipment Rentals. Notes:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">* Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (“EBITDA”) is not a recognized measure under IFRS, and, accordingly, Strad's use of such a term may not be comparable to similarly defined measures presented by other entities; see “Non-IFRS and Additional IFRS Measures and Reconciliations”.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">* Funded debt includes bank indebtedness plus long-term debt plus current and long-term obligations under finance lease less cash.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">* Covenant EBITDA, as defined in the Company's credit facility agreement, is based on trailing twelve months adjusted EBITDA plus share based payments, plus additional one-time charges.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">* During the second quarter of 2018, the Company changed the method of calculation for EBITDA by no longer adjusting for gains or losses resulting from foreign exchange or the disposal of property, plant and equipment during the normal course of business. These changes have been updated for prior period balances. "The current operating environment represents a unique dynamic for Strad, as the traditional drivers of our business, namely a robust energy sector with growing rig counts, is not reflected in the current state of affairs. Yet, I am excited about Strad’s outlook, in large measure due to our recently created Industrial Matting division,” said Andy Pernal, President and CEO of Strad. “The drivers of this business line are positive; for instance, the building of large scale infrastructural projects such as LNG Canada and the Coastal GasLink pipeline will require extensive matting support. Moreover, there exists a long list of additional pending, large-scale projects, as well. Finally, matting’s utility extends well beyond the energy sector, and geographically beyond our historical markets. That is why this past quarter we more than doubled the growth capital committed to matting - to adapt to our evolving operating climate and to capitalize on its potential."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Fiscally, the quarter highlighted our ability to maintain strong margins and EBITDA levels with disciplined cost containment, even in the face of modest revenue headwinds,” said Michael Donovan, CFO of Strad. “With our available free cash flow, we reduced our long-term debt and in part funded our matting division’s growth capex investments. Also this quarter, consistent with our strategic emphasis on matting, we modified how we report performance by segmenting our results into our two principal divisions, Industrial Matting and Equipment Rentals to provide greater clarity into our operations.”</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">THIRD QUARTER RESULTS</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Strad reported a decrease in revenue and EBITDA of 8% and 31%, respectively during the three months ended September 30, 2018, compared to the same period in 2017. During the three months ended September 30, 2018, Strad reported net income of $0.9 million compared to net income of $0.6 million in 2017.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For the three months ended September 30, 2018, Strad's Industrial Matting segment reported a decrease in revenue and EBITDA of 8% and 30% as compared to the same period in 2017. Earnings before interest and taxes ("EBIT") from Industrial Matting decreased from $5.0 million in the third quarter of 2017 to $4.1 million in the third quarter of 2018. The decrease in revenue, EBITDA and EBIT is a result of lower utilization due to project delays in comparison to the third quarter of 2017. The decrease in revenue for the third quarter of 2018 was offset by improved customer pricing as compared to the same period in 2017.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Strad’s Equipment Rentals segment reported a decrease in revenue and EBITDA of 7% and 40%, respectively, during the three months ended September 30, 2018, compared to the same period in 2017. The decrease in revenue was a result of decreased surface equipment utilization in Canada which was slightly offset by an increase in pricing and utilization in the U.S.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">During the third quarter of 2018, capital expenditures were $10.1 million in Industrial Matting, $0.1 million in Equipment Rentals and $0.3 million in Corporate. The majority of the capital additions were related to wood matting additions, which were acquired to prepare for and to support industrial matting projects expected to begin during the fourth quarter of 2018.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">OUTLOOK</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Macro economic conditions during the third quarter and into the fourth quarter of 2018 continue to be mixed. West Texas Intermediate (“WTI”) pricing has ranged between $60 and $75 U.S. per barrel, natural gas prices have been steady at Henry Hub and positive U.S. tax changes have spurred a pro-investment environment in the United States. In Canada, widening commodity price differentials have significantly hampered producer cash flow and investment. Lack of pipeline access to tidewater continues to plague the Canadian energy industry and the Canadian economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On a positive note, however, a substantial infrastructure project has been approved in Canada. LNG Canada, the largest energy investment in Canadian history, was formally green-lighted on October 1, 2018, subsequent to the quarter-end. This project and associated infrastructure and pipelines are expected to take five years to complete and will provide significant opportunity for our Industrial Matting and Equipment Rentals segments. The Coastal GasLink pipeline is expected to cost over $4.8 billion and take approximately four years to construct. We expect continued opportunities related to these and other projects to contribute meaningfully to our activity levels in the Industrial Matting segment in future quarters.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">During the third quarter of 2018, Strad reorganized the Company's geographical segments, Canada and the United States, into two new distinct reportable segments, Industrial Matting and Equipment Rentals. This reporting structure provides additional detail and insight into our business for both shareholders and potential investors, and is consistent with how management assesses performance and allocates resources. The Company’s focus will be to maximize the opportunity within its growing Industrial Matting segment in both Canada and the United States.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Year-to-date, 2018 Industrial Matting revenue and EBITDA trail 2017 results, due to the timing of major projects in 2018 in Canada offset by increased activity in the U.S. However, late in the third quarter, Industrial Matting momentum has been building with the launch of <span class="companylink">TransCanada</span>’s North Montney MainLine project as well as several other projects in both countries. To date, most U.S. matting opportunities have been driven by drilling activity however we continue to pursue matting opportunities outside of the Oil & Gas sector in the U.S.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Equipment Rentals segment in 2018 remains fairly consistent with prior year, however, increased Equipment Rentals activity in the United States has offset lower year-over-year results in Canada. We continue to see growth and opportunity in our Equipment Rentals business in the United States and expect seasonal activity levels to improve in Canada as we head into the fall and winter drilling season.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As previously announced, Strad’s capital program has been increased by an additional $15.5 million to $28.5 million in 2018. The additional capital will be allocated to increasing the matting fleet by approximately 22,000 mats to meet the demand of current and pending projects. The increased growth capital will allow Strad the opportunity to participate in the construction of extensive Canadian infrastructure projects that have recently been approved.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2018, our free cash flow has allowed us to increase our capital program and repurchase shares under our Normal Course Issuer Bid (“NCIB”) while carrying a minimal amount of debt. Our free cash flow and strong balance sheet provide the flexibility to evaluate many alternatives to create shareholder value, including both organic growth opportunities or strategic acquisitions.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">* Matting fleet balances are as at September 30, 2018 and 2017.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">* Matting fleet balances are averages for the three months ended September 30, 2018 and 2017.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">* Equipment utilization includes surface and matting equipment on rent only and is calculated using gross asset value. Revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2018, of $16.4 million decreased 8% compared to $17.9 million during the same period of 2017. Decreased revenue was primarily due to the timing of industrial matting projects in comparison to the same quarter of 2017. In Canada, there were fewer ongoing matting projects as compared to the same quarter of 2017, which led to a decrease in utilization to 36% from 56%. Further impacting revenue was a 10% decrease in average matting pricing in Canada as compared to the third quarter of 2017. This was offset by an increase in U.S. matting revenue, due to a 58% increase in average matting pricing and an increase in utilization to 43% from 38% as compared to the third quarter of 2017.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">During the third quarter of 2018, Strad's matting fleet increased to 101,210 mats at September 30, 2018, compared to 85,100 mats at September 30, 2017, to meet the expected increase in customer demand. Late in the third quarter of 2018, Strad began deploying mats on a major project in Northeastern British Columbia.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">EBITDA for the three months ended September 30, 2018, decreased 30% to $5.5 million as compared to $7.8 million during the three months ended September 30, 2017. EBITDA as a percentage of revenue was 33% at September 30, 2018, compared to 44% at September 30, 2017. The decrease in EBITDA is driven primarily by the decrease in revenue as well as an increase in operating expenses by 10% during the third quarter of 2018 as compared to the same period in 2017.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">During the third quarter of 2018, EBIT decreased to $4.1 million compared to $5.0 million during the same period of 2017. The primary driver for the decrease in EBIT was the decrease in EBITDA for the third quarter of 2018 compared to the third quarter of 2017. The decrease in EBITDA was offset by depreciation expense, which was higher in the third quarter of 2017 compared to 2018.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2018, decreased 7% to $42.0 million from $45.0 million during the same period of 2017. The primary decrease in Canadian revenue year-over-year is due to the timing of matting projects, which resulted in a decrease in utilization to 30% from 53%. This was offset by the 136% revenue increase in the U.S. to $12.2 million, compared to $5.2 million during the same period in 2017, due to drilling related matting projects within the U.S., which led to an increase in utilization to 40% from 26%. Further impacting U.S. revenue was a 71% increase in pricing year-over-year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">During the nine months ended September 30, 2018, EBITDA decreased 22% to $13.2 million compared to $16.9 million for the same period of 2017. The decrease in EBITDA is primarily due to the decrease in revenue year-over-year in addition to a nominal increase in operating expenses, due to increased lease payments and personnel costs. EBITDA as a percentage of revenue decreased to 31% for the nine months ended September 31, 2018, as compared to 38% for the nine months ended September 31, 2017.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">EBIT for the nine months ended September 30, 2018, decreased to $9.2 million as compared to $9.6 million for the same period in 2017. The decrease in EBIT is primarily driven by the decrease in EBITDA for the third quarter of 2018 as compared to the third quarter of 2017. The decrease in EBITDA was offset by the decrease in depreciation expense to $4.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2018, as compared to $7.3 million for the nine months ended September 31, 2017. The decrease in depreciation expense is due to the accelerated depreciation of mats with no remaining useful life during 2017 that did not re-occur in 2018.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Operating expenses for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018, increased 10% and 1%, respectively, to $9.6 million and $25.2 million as compared to $8.8 million and $25.0 million during the same period of 2017. The increase in operating expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2018, is primarily due to higher transportation and other third party costs for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018, as compared to the same periods in 2017.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">* Source: <span class="companylink">Baker Hughes</span> "North America Rotary Rig Count". Rig Counts are average rig counts for the period. Revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2018, decreased 7% to $14.9 million from $16.0 million during the same period in 2017. Revenue decreased primarily due to lower Canadian revenue, which was the result of the discontinuance of the drill cuttings management service line that was still operating in the third quarter of 2017. The decrease was partially offset by increased revenue in the U.S., which was due to an improvement in utilization to 43% from 38% and a 10% improvement in average pricing when compared to the third quarter of 2017. U.S. utilization improved as a result of the increase in rig counts in the Bakken and Marcellus by 6% and 1%, respectively, which was offset by a decrease in rig counts in the Rockies by 7%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">During the third quarter, EBITDA decreased 40% to $1.6 million from $2.6 million during the third quarter of 2017. EBITDA as a percentage of revenue decreased to 11% at September 30, 2018, compared to 16% at September 30, 2017. The decrease in EBITDA was driven primarily by the decrease in revenue during the third quarter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">EBIT for the three months ended September 30, 2018, decreased 33% to $(2.4) million from $(1.8) million during the same period of 2017. The decrease in EBIT is driven primarily by the decrease in EBITDA, partially offset by lower depreciation expense during the third quarter of 2018 of $4.0 million compared to $4.4 million in 2017.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2018, increased 1% to $45.6 million from $45.1 million at September 30, 2017. The increase in revenue was driven by the increase in U.S. surface equipment utilization to 40% from 34% and the 16% increase in pricing year-over-year. Utilization improved due to the increase in rig counts in the Bakken, Marcellus and the Rockies of 18%, 13% and 10% respectively. This was offset by lower revenue in Canada which was the result of lower rig counts, by 6%, in addition to the discontinuance of the drill cuttings management service line and a decrease in utilization to 32% from 35%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">During the nine months ended September 30, 2018, EBITDA decreased 6% to $5.8 million from $6.2 million during the same period in 2017. The decrease in EBITDA was driven by increased operating expenses year-over-year. EBITDA as a percentage of revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2018, remained consistent at 13% compared to 14% during the same period of 2017.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">EBIT for the nine months ended September 30, 2018, increased 19% to $(6.1) million from $(7.6) million during the same period in 2017.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">* Facilities are subject to certain limitations on accounts receivable, inventory, and net book value of fixed assets and are secured by a general security agreement over all of the Company's assets. As at September 30, 2018, Strad had access to $48.5 million of credit facilities. As at September 30, 2018, working capital was $13.1 million compared to $19.6 million at December 31, 2017. The change in current assets is a result of a 3% increase in accounts receivable to $26.7 million for the third quarter of 2018 compared to $26.0 million for the fourth quarter of 2017. The increase in accounts receivable is due to the timing of collections of accounts receivable outstanding, in addition to revenue being higher in the third quarter of 2018 as compared to the fourth quarter of 2017. Inventory decreased by 33% to $1.2 million at September 30, 2018, from $1.8 million at December 31, 2017. Prepaid expenses increased 23% at September 30, 2018, as compared to December 31, 2017. The decrease in inventory and the increase in prepaids relates to the normal course of business. During the third quarter of 2018, the Company sold the property included in other assets for proceeds of $1.3 million, which further contributed to the decrease in current assets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The change in current liabilities is a result of a 29% increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities to $15.3 million at September 30, 2018, compared to $11.9 million at year end. The increase in accounts payable is primarily due to higher operating expenses in the third quarter of 2018 as compared to the fourth quarter of 2017 in addition to the timing of payments made for the third quarter of 2018.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Cash flow from operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2018, increased to $23.6 million compared to $10.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2017, due to a net income as opposed to a net loss, increased cash generated from used fleet sales and an unwind of non-cash working capital. Funds from operations for the three months ended September 30, 2018, decreased to $8.6 million compared to $11.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2017. Capital expenditures totaled $10.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2018. Management monitors funds from operations and the timing of capital additions to ensure adequate capital resources are available to fund Strad’s capital program.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As at September 30, 2018, the Company’s syndicated banking facility consists of an operating facility with a maximum principal amount of $7.0 million CAD and $5.0 million USD, and a $36.5 million CAD syndicated revolving facility, both of which are subject to certain limitations on accounts receivable, inventory, and net book value of fixed assets and are secured by a general security agreement over all of the Company’s assets. As at September 30, 2018, the Company had access to the maximum credit facilities. The syndicated banking facility will mature on September 29, 2021. The syndicated banking facility bears interest at bank prime plus a variable rate, which is dependent on the Company’s funded debt to covenant EBITDA ratio.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Based on the Company's funded debt to covenant EBITDA ratio, the interest rate on the syndicated credit facility is bank prime plus 0.50% on prime rate advances and at the prevailing rate plus a stamping fee of 1.50% on bankers' acceptances. For the three months ended September 30, 2018, the overall effective rates on the operating facility and revolving facility were 4.21% and 4.41%, respectively. As of September 30, 2018, $1.0 million was drawn on the operating facility and $6.4 million was drawn on the revolving facility. Required payments on the revolving facility are interest only.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NON-IFRS AND ADDITIONAL IFRS MEASURES AND RECONCILIATIONS</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Certain supplementary measures in this MD&A do not have any standardized meaning as prescribed under IFRS and, therefore, are considered non-IFRS measures. These measures are described and presented in order to provide shareholders and potential investors with additional information regarding the Company’s financial results, liquidity and its ability to generate funds to finance its operations. These measures are identified and presented, where appropriate, together with reconciliations to the equivalent IFRS measure. However, they should not be construed as alternative measures to IFRS measures, and as they do not have standardized meanings or standardized methods of calculation, the may not be consistent with or comparable to similar measures presented by other companies. These measures are further explained below.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (“EBITDA”) is not a recognized measure under IFRS. Management believes that in addition to net income (loss), EBITDA is a useful supplemental measure as it provides an indication of the results generated by the Company’s principal business activities prior to consideration of how those activities are financed and taxed. As of June 30, 2018, the Company implemented changes to its method of calculating EBITDA, which no longer includes adjustments for gains and losses due to foreign exchange or disposal of property, plant and equipment that occur during the normal course of business. EBITDA is now calculated as net income (loss) before interest, taxes, and depreciation and amortization. Segmented EBITDA is based upon the same calculation for defined business segments, which are comprised of Industrial Matting and Equipment Rentals. The Company’s method of calculating EBITDA may differ from that of other organizations and, accordingly, its EBITDA may not be comparable to that of other companies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Earnings before interest and taxes (“EBIT”) is an additional measure under IFRS. Management believes that in addition to net income (loss), EBIT is a useful supplemental measure as it provides an indication of the results generated by the Company’s principal business activities prior to consideration of how those activities are financed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Funds from operations are cash flow from operating activities excluding changes in non-cash working capital. Funds from operations is a non-IFRS measure commonly used in the energy services industry to assist in measuring a company's ability to finance its capital programs, debt repayments and other financial obligations. Funds from operations is not intended to represent net cash generated from operating activities or other measures of financial performance in accordance with IFRS. It is a supplemental measure to gauge performance of the Company before non-cash items. The Company’s method of calculating funds from operations may differ from that of other organizations and, accordingly, its funds from operations may not be comparable to that of other companies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Working capital is calculated as current assets minus current liabilities, as derived from the Company's consolidated statement of financial position. Working capital, cash forecasting, and banking facilities are used by Management to ensure funds are available to finance growth opportunities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Funded debt is a measure used in calculating our bank financial covenants. Funded debt is calculated as bank indebtedness plus long-term debt plus current and long-term portion of finance lease obligations less cash from syndicate institutions.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">* Earnings before Interest (Finance Costs), Income Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization (“EBITDA”) and Earnings before Interest (Finance Costs) and Taxes (“EBIT”) are considered non-GAAP measures, which may not be comparable with similar non-GAAP measures used by other entities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">* Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP measure. Please refer to the full reconciliation of these items in the Adjusted EBITDA section.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">* Determined by taking the trailing 12-month period.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">* Bookings and backlog are considered non-GAAP measures that do not have standardized meanings as prescribed by GAAP, and are therefore unlikely to be comparable to similar measures used by other entities. “During the quarter, Enerflex delivered solid financial results with revenues of $446 million and EBIT of $56 million,” said J. Blair Goertzen, Enerflex’s President and Chief Executive Officer. “Several major projects across the Company drove record bookings of $629 million in the third quarter, continuing the trend of strong bookings seen in the first half of 2018. Backlog, a key leading indicator of future revenues, also had significant growth and exceeded $1 billion for the first time in our history. Our near-term outlook remains healthy based on continued strength in bid activity in all regions. Consistent with our strategic objective of deploying capital to recurring revenue, our Rental product line is positioned to benefit from the recent award of two additional 10-year Build-Own-Operate-Maintain contracts, along with the expansion of the USA contract compression business, which has grown organically by 39 percent in the past year.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Quarterly Overview</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">* EBIT for the quarter is $56 million, which is up from $33 million in the comparative period. This increase is driven by a $38 million increase in gross margin offset by lower gains on disposal of property, plant and equipment (“PP&E”). Gains on PP&E included in EBIT were $6 million compared to $19 million in 2017. Also included in EBIT were cost recoveries of $9 million related to the partial ruling on the Oman Oil Exploration and Production LLC (“OOCEP”) arbitration that the Company was awarded in the quarter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">* Bookings were the highest quarterly amount in the Company’s history at $629 million, led by the USA with $361 million over a variety of customers. Canadian bookings increased to $201 million compared to $43 million in 2017, driven primarily by increased midstream activity. The Rest of World (“ROW”) bookings of $67 million relate to projects in the Middle East/Africa (“MEA”) region.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">* Backlog of $1,065 million increased from $671 million at December 31, 2017 due to the strength of the USA and Canada bookings outpacing Engineered Systems revenue recognized. Backlog is a key leading indicator of future revenues and the balance at September 30, 2018 represents the highest quarterly backlog in the Company’s history.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">* The Company’s positive outlook, record backlog, and continued high enquiry levels, particularly in the USA and ROW segments, provides strong support for additional manufacturing capacity to meet demand in these segments. Given the current and anticipated future project requirements, the Company is currently expanding the square footage of its Houston fabrication facility by 55%, adding approximately 100,000 square feet. This expansion is scheduled to be completed during the first quarter of 2019.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">* The Company invested $23 million in rental assets during the quarter, continuing the organic expansion of the USA rental fleet, which has grown 39 percent since the acquisition of the contract compression business from Mesa Compression, LLC (“Mesa”).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">* During the quarter, the Company was awarded a 10-year Build-Own-Operate-Maintain (“BOOM”) contract in Latin America, with an additional 10-year BOOM contract being awarded in MEA subsequent to the quarter. Earlier in the year, the Company commenced operations on a previously awarded 10-year BOOM project in Latin America. Once fully operational these three projects are expected to generate annualized revenue of approximately $32 million to $35 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">* The Company repaid $59 million of debt in the quarter, resulting in a bank-adjusted net debt to EBITDA ratio of 0.7:1.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">* As a result of the backlog position, positive outlook for activity in 2019, and strong free cash flows, the Board of Directors approved an increase in the quarterly dividend to $0.105 per share. The increased dividend is payable on January 10, 2019, to shareholders of record on November 22, 2018. This new dividend represents an 11 percent increase and reiterates the Company’s commitment to returning capital to shareholders. Enerflex has increased its dividend by 75 percent since re-emerging as a public company in 2011. Third Quarter Results SummaryEngineered Systems revenue increased by $109 million when compared to the third quarter of 2017, driven primarily by strength in the USA segment. Rental revenues also increased due to the contributions of the contract compression fleet in the USA and BOOM revenues in Colombia. Service revenues have grown as a result of higher activity levels in the United States and Australia. Gross margins increased due to higher revenues and improved gross margin percentage, as the prior year included margin erosion on some significant projects in the USA and Canada segments. SG&A costs increased slightly compared to the same period of 2017 due to higher compensation costs and foreign exchange impacts in Argentina, partially offset by cost recoveries related to the OOCEP arbitration and lower third-party costs associated with the arbitration.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Third Quarter Segmented ResultsUSAUSA segment revenue was $273 million, an increase of $120 million from the same period in 2017. Engineered Systems revenue improved as a result of the realization of strong bookings seen in prior quarters and continued progress of certain large projects, as well as the impact of the stronger U.S. dollar in 2018 versus the comparative period. Service revenues increased on higher activity across the region while Rental revenues improved due to the acquisition of the contract compression business from Mesa and the organic growth of the contract compression fleet. An increase of $26 million in EBIT was driven by higher revenues and gross margins, partially offset by higher SG&A costs driven by increased compensation on a larger workforce, mark-to-market impacts on share-based compensation, and increased profit share on improved operational results.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rest of WorldRevenue in the Rest of World segment increased by $30 million, the result of higher Engineered Systems revenue in MEA and improved Service revenue, primarily in Australia. EBIT increased by $12 million due to higher revenues and lower SG&A costs, partially offset by lower project margins in MEA resulting from higher estimated costs to complete certain projects. SG&A costs decreased as a result of cost recoveries related to the OOCEP arbitration and lower third-party costs associated with the arbitration. This decrease, however, was partially offset by negative foreign exchange impacts in Argentina and higher compensation cost driven by mark-to-market impacts on share-based compensation and increased profit share on improved operational results.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CanadaCanadian revenue decreased by $19 million on lower Engineered Systems revenue driven by weaker bookings seen in prior quarters. Service revenue increased by $2 million in the third quarter from additional parts sales, while Rental revenue decreased due to lower equipment sales. EBIT increased by $2 million on lower occupancy costs resulting from idle facilities sold in the quarter and previous periods, as well as decreased SG&A costs, driven by lower compensation on reduced workforce. The Company continues to closely monitor SG&A costs in response to the uncertain Canadian business environment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">OutlookThe Company delivered strong financial results during the third quarter, primarily based on the strength of performance in the USA and ROW segments. Bookings were the highest in the Company’s history, driven by strong market conditions in the USA and ROW segments and improved activity in Canada. The backlog provides visibility over revenues for the remainder of 2018 and into 2019. Bidding activity for Engineered Systems remains strong across all regions and the Company continues to see interest for Rentals and BOOM solutions in the USA and ROW segments. Enerflex’s financial performance continues to benefit from strategic decisions to diversify product offerings for Engineered Systems and to focus on the recurring revenue streams derived from new and existing long-term BOOM, rental and service contracts. The Company’s strategy of regional and product diversification positions Enerflex to focus on areas where activity will remain strong. In the near term, we have a positive outlook supported by the record backlog and continued high enquiry levels across all regions. In the longer term, the Company continues to monitor the impacts of volatility in realized commodity prices; political uncertainty; egress issues in the Permian, which are anticipated to be resolved in the latter half of 2019; as well as the lack of consistent access to market causing pricing differentials to widen in Canada. Enerflex continues to assess the effects of these contributing factors and the corresponding impact on our customers’ activity levels, which could reduce demand for the Company’s products and services in future periods.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Adjusted EBITDAThe Company’s results include items that are unique and items that management and users of the financial statements add back when evaluating the Company’s results. The presentation of Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered in isolation from EBIT or EBITDA as determined under IFRS. Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other companies and should not be considered in isolation or as a replacement for measures prepared as determined under IFRS.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The items that have been adjusted for presentation purposes relate generally to four categories: 1) impairment or gains on idle facilities; 2) restructuring activities; 3) acquisition costs; and, 4) share-based compensation. Identification of these items allows for an understanding of the underlying operations of the Company based on the current assets and structure. Enerflex has presented the impact of share-based compensation as it is an item that can fluctuate significantly with share price changes during a period based on factors that are not specific to the long-term performance of the Company. The disposal of idle facilities is isolated within Adjusted EBITDA as they are not reflective of the ongoing operations of the Company and are idled as a result of restructuring activities.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CALGARY, Alberta, Nov. 08, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- <span class="companylink">CES Energy Solutions Corp</span>. ("CES" or the “Company”) (TSX: CEU) (OTC – Nasdaq Intl: CESDF) is pleased to report on its financial and operating results for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018. Further, CES announced today that it will pay a cash dividend of $0.005 per common share on December 14, 2018 to the shareholders of record at the close of business on November 30, 2018.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Q3 2018, CES generated revenue of $338.5 million and Adjusted EBITDAC of $45.6 million, both representing record quarterly results achieved by the Company.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Record revenue of $338.5 million during Q3 2018 represented an increase of $77.6 million or 30% compared to $260.9 million in revenue for Q3 2017. Revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2018 was $923.1 million as compared to $750.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2017. Revenue generated in the US increased 34% and 28% to $227.1 million and $608.1 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018, respectively, over the 2017 comparative periods. Q3 2018 revenue generated in the US of $227.1 million is the highest US revenue quarter in the Company’s history exceeding the previous record quarter for the US which was Q2 2018 with $201.5 million. Contributing to the year-over-year increase of 34% was CES’ completed investments in US infrastructure and capabilities to date, significant activity improvement in the drilling fluids business and increased US Treatment Points, particularly in the Permian Basin. For Q3 2018, the Company’s US source revenues were positively impacted on translation by weakness in the Canadian Dollar (“CAD”) versus US Dollar (“USD”), compared to Q3 2017.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Revenue generated in Canada increased 21% and 14% to $111.4 million and $315.1 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018, respectively, over the 2017 comparative periods. Q3 began on solid footing in Canada, with strong performance in July and August leading into mid-September when weather and ground conditions slowed drilling activity and prevented access for certain production chemical deliveries. PureChem contributed the majority of the Canadian revenue gain for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018 compared to the comparative periods in prior year, as completed investments in PureChem infrastructure continue to enable increased market share in Canada in the production chemicals business. Revenues in CES’ drilling fluids business in Canada also increased in 2018 compared to 2017, due to increased activity in the respective three and nine month periods.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Gross Margin in Q3 2018 was $75.9 million or 22.4% of revenue, compared to Gross Margin of $63.9 million or 24.5% of revenue generated in Q3 2017. Year-to-date Gross Margin totaled $214.6 million, compared to $182.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2017, representing an increase of $32.4 million or 18%. In Q3 2018, CES recorded Gross Margin (excluding depreciation) of $86.2 million or 25.5% of revenue, compared to Gross Margin (excluding depreciation) of $73.0 million or 28.0% of revenue generated in Q3 2017. Year-to-date Gross Margin (excluding depreciation) totaled $244.3 million, compared to $209.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2017, representing an increase of $34.6 million or 16%. CES continues to benefit from operating leverage in our consumable chemicals business model, except in the Permian where continued strong growth has caused CES’ infrastructure to temporarily reach its efficiency capacity as expansionary investments continue to de-bottleneck operations. CES has previously announced expansion plans to its Permian infrastructure to address the needs of its growing Permian businesses. These gains were offset by cost inflation incurred throughout 2018, which has outpaced the Company’s ability to pass through its input costs to its customers for its products and services. Further, weather related challenges in Canada during September also temporarily negatively affected Gross Margin as activity levels declined and corresponding lower revenue was over the same fixed cost base. As a result, Gross Margin (excluding depreciation) as a percentage of revenue in Q3 2018 has decreased from Q3 2017. CES believes that as it increases sales in areas such as the Permian and the Deep Basin, CES’ operating leverage from its expanded infrastructure, innovative technologies, and superior service culture will improve margins going forward. Net income for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018 was $5.9 million and $32.3 million, respectively, compared to $19.4 million and $33.6 million for the 2017 respective periods.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">EBITDAC for Q3 2018 was $43.1 million as compared to $40.7 million for Q3 2017, representing an increase of $2.4 million or 6%. Excluding CFO-related one-time management transition costs of $2.5 million incurred in the quarter, Adjusted EBITDAC was $45.6 million. Year-to-date EBITDAC was $123.1 million as compared to $112.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2017, representing an increase of $10.9 million or 10%. Excluding one-time CFO-related management transition costs of $2.5 million incurred in the quarter, Adjusted EBITDAC was $125.5 million. Net income for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018 was $5.9 million and $32.3 million, respectively, compared to $19.4 million and $33.6 million for the 2017 respective periods. Year-over-year, the Company’s operating results continued to benefit from increased activity levels due to the improved commodity price environment, and CES’ business’ in both US and Canada have made positive contributions to revenue, net income and EBITDAC. CES continues to maintain a prudent balance sheet to support its business needs and capitalize on improving oilfield activity in both the US and Canada throughout the cycle. In October 2017, CES successfully re-financed and reduced its coupon on its $300.0 million Senior Notes by issuing new 6.375% Senior Notes which have an extended maturity into October 2024.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At September 30, 2018, CES had a net draw of $149.4 million on its Senior Facility (December 31, 2017 – $109.3 million), representing an increase of $56.4 million from June 30, 2018, The increase was primarily driven by working capital build attributable to record revenue levels, typical Q2 to Q3 build in preparation for upcoming seasonally driven higher activity levels, and for opportunistic inventory purchases in the quarter. Capital allocation in Q3 also included expansionary capex for the Kermit mud plant in the Permian Basin, PureChem’s production chemical Grande Prairie facility and opportunistic share repurchases through CES’ normal course issuer bid (“NCIB”) program.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The maximum available draw on the Senior Facility at September 30, 2018 was $125.0 million on the Canadian facility and US$40.0 million on the US facility (December 31, 2017 - $125.0 million and US $40.0 million, respectively). On November 8, 2018, the Company amended its Senior Facility to exercise $55.0 million of available accordion capacity, increasing the maximum amount available on the Canadian facility from $125.0 million to $180.0 million, in addition to the US$40.0 million on the US facility. All other terms and conditions of the Senior Facility remain unchanged. In early 2016, CES took a voluntary reduction in the amount of $50.0 million on the maximum borrowing amount on its Canadian facility, which provided adequate liquidity during the downturn as working capital returned to the balance sheet in the form of cash. As activity levels have rebounded and market conditions have improved, this $55.0 million increase in availability on the Senior Facility addresses the needs of the Company’s growing business in the recovery. As at the date hereof, the Company has a net draw of approximately $160.0 million on its Senior Facility.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CES continues to see improvement in its financial position and the Company’s Board of Directors and management view share repurchases as a prudent component of its capital allocation at this time as they believe that the current market price of CES’s common shares does not reflect their underlying value. On July 17, 2018, the Company began an NCIB program to repurchase for cancellation up to 24,587,978 common shares. The NCIB will terminate on July 16, 2019 or such earlier date as the maximum number of common shares are purchased pursuant to the NCIB or the NCIB is completed or is terminated at the Company’s election. In Q3 2018, the Company repurchased 2,700,000 common shares at an average price of $4.574 per share for a total amount $12.4 million. Subsequent to September 30, 2018, the Company purchased 1,300,000 additional shares at a weighted average price per share of $3.601 for a total of $4.7 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Outlook</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CES is very optimistic about its prospects for the remainder of 2018 and beyond. CES’ record consolidated revenue result and record US revenue result in Q3 2018 reflect its effective execution in a dynamic environment and CES’ strategy has positioned the Company to take advantage of the opportunities ahead. CES believes that over time it can continue to grow its share of the oilfield consumable chemical markets in which it competes. CES also sees the consumable chemical market increasing its share of the oilfield spend as operators continue to: drill longer reach laterals and drill them faster; expand and optimize the utilization of pad drilling and cube development techniques; increase the intensity and size of their fracs; and require increasingly technical and specialized chemical treatments to effectively maintain existing cash flow generating wells and treat growing production from new wells.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the US, CES’ infrastructure is largely built out to meet anticipated growing production chemical and drilling fluid needs in the key basins. In the Permian Basin, the Kermit, Texas mud plant expansion has been designed to double capacity, positioning the Company to take on new work and continue to grow market share. In addition, Catalyst’s current platform is setup to capitalize on growing production and higher levels of activity in the Permian Basin, and CES continues to recruit top talent in this highly competitive region. CES also plans to build a strategically located barite facility in the northeast US in 2019, expanding its existing barite grinding capabilities and further adding to the Company’s competitive positioning and operating leverage.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Canada, CES’ production chemical infrastructure is also largely complete, and CES is well positioned to increase financial contribution from its PureChem division as the Company grows into this infrastructure and continues to add scale. In Canada, current industry takeaway capacity issues and a lack of consistent market access has caused differentials to widen significantly, thereby tempering current activity levels by operators. Weather related challenges temporarily limited access in the WCSB and affected CES’ Canadian business in Q3 2018, with poor weather conditions continuing into early October. Despite these challenges, CES expects activity levels in Q1 2019 to achieve the higher levels typically seen in the first quarter in Canada, with further clarity on this as operators’ capital budgets are finalized during Q4 2018.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CES’ strategy is to utilize its decentralized management model; its vertically integrated manufacturing model; its problem solving through science approach; its patented and proprietary technologies; and its superior people and execution to increase market share. The downturn made many middlemen, or competitors who are simply resellers of other company’s products, redundant. By being basic in the manufacture of the consumable chemicals it sells, CES continues to be price competitive and a technology leader. Recent competitor consolidations and business failures will provide further opportunities for CES in this recovery period as operators require increasingly technical solutions and deeper customer-centric coverage models to meet their needs. CES believes that its unique value proposition makes it the premier independent provider of technically advanced consumable chemical solutions to the North American oilfield.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CES’ balance sheet is well positioned to capitalize on the improving oilfield activity. In October 2017, CES successfully re-financed and reduced its coupon on its $300.0 million Senior Notes by issuing new 6.375% Senior Notes which have an extended maturity into October 2024. In 2018, it is expected that EBITDAC will materially exceed the sum of cash expenditures on interest, taxes, and capital expenditures, allowing for free cash flow to be returned to shareholders through CES’ monthly dividend and recently implemented NCIB.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As CES’ infrastructure buildout in both Canada and the US is largely completed in 2018, absent acceptable return expansionary capital projects, such as the buildout of the northeast US barite facility, CES expects capital expenditures in 2019 to return to levels below 2017-2018 levels. CES’ business model, capital structure and free cash flow generation attributes continue to permit prudent capital allocation to one or a combination of: investment in current operations, debt reduction, opportunistic share repurchases, dividends and acquisitions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CES will continue to assess organic and M&A opportunities that will improve CES’ competitive position and enhance profitability. Any acquisitions must meet CES’ stringent financial and operational metrics. In its core businesses, CES will focus on profitably growing market share, controlling costs, developing or acquiring new technologies, and making strategic investments as required to position the business to capitalize on the industry rebound and increasing intensity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Conference Call Details</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With respect to the third quarter results, CES will host a conference call / webcast at 9:00 am MT (11:00 am ET) on Friday, November 9, 2018.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Notes: 1CES uses certain performance measures that are not recognizable under International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”). These performance measures include net income (loss) before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, finance costs, other gains and losses, and stock-based compensation (“EBITDAC”), Adjusted EBITDAC, Gross Margin (excluding depreciation), and Net Debt. Management believes that these measures provide supplemental financial information that is useful in the evaluation of CES’ operations. Readers should be cautioned, however, that these measures should not be construed as alternatives to measures determined in accordance with IFRS as an indicator of CES’ performance. CES’ method of calculating these measures may differ from that of other organizations and, accordingly, these may not be comparable. Please refer to the Non-GAAP measures section of CES’ MD&A for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018 for additional details regarding the calculation of these Non-GAAP measures. 2 Includes long-term portion of the deferred acquisition consideration, the Senior Facility, the Senior Notes, and finance lease obligations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Business of CES</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CES is a leading provider of technically advanced consumable chemical solutions throughout the life-cycle of the oilfield. This includes total solutions at the drill-bit, at the point of completion and stimulation, at the wellhead and pump-jack, and finally through to the pipeline and midstream market. At the drill-bit, CES’ designed drilling fluids encompass the functions of cleaning the hole, stabilizing the rock drilled, controlling subsurface pressures, enhancing drilling rates, and protecting potential production zones while conserving the environment in the surrounding surface and subsurface area. At the point of completion and stimulation, CES’ designed chemicals form a critical component of fracturing solutions or other forms of remedial well stimulation techniques. The shift to horizontal drilling and multi-stage fracturing with long horizontal well completions has been responsible for significant growth in the drilling fluids and completion and stimulation chemicals markets. At the wellhead and pump-jack, CES’ designed production and specialty chemicals provide down-hole solutions for production and gathering infrastructure to maximize production and reduce costs of equipment maintenance. Key solutions include corrosion inhibitors, demulsifiers, H2S scavengers, paraffin control products, surfactants, scale inhibitors, biocides and other specialty products. Further, specialty chemicals are used throughout the pipeline and midstream industry to aid in hydrocarbon movement and manage transportation and processing challenges including corrosion, wax build-up and H2S.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CES operates in the Western Canadian Sedimentary Basin (“WCSB”) and in several basins throughout the United States (“US”), including Permian, Eagleford, Bakken and Marcellus with an emphasis on servicing the ongoing major resource plays. In Canada, CES operates under the trade names <span class="companylink">Canadian Energy Services</span>, PureChem Services (“PureChem”), StimWrx Energy Services Ltd. (“StimWrx”), Sialco Materials Ltd. (“Sialco”), and Clear <span class="companylink">Environmental Solutions</span> (“Clear”). In the US, CES operates under the trade names AES Drilling Fluids (“AES”), Superior Weighting Products (“Superior Weighting”), JACAM Chemicals (“JACAM”), and Catalyst Oilfield Services (“Catalyst”).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Canadian Energy Services and AES brands are focused on the design and implementation of drilling fluids systems and completion solutions sold directly to oil and gas producers. The StimWrx brand provides near matrix stimulation and remediation of oil, gas, and injection wells in Western Canada. The Superior Weighting brand custom grinds minerals including barite, which is the weighting agent utilized in most drilling fluid systems. The JACAM, Catalyst, PureChem, and Sialco brands are vertically integrated manufacturers of advanced specialty chemicals. In addition to being basic in the manufacture of oilfield chemicals, JACAM, Catalyst, and PureChem have expanding distribution channels into the oilfield.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Clear is a complimentary business division that supports the operations and augments the product offerings in the WCSB. Clear is CES’ environmental division, providing environmental consulting, water management and water transfer services, and drilling fluids waste disposal services primarily to oil and gas producers active in the WCSB.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CES continues to invest in research and development of new technologies and in the top-end scientific talent that can develop and refine these technologies. CES operates eight separate lab facilities across North America: two in Houston, Texas; two in Midland, Texas; one in Sterling, Kansas; and one in each of Calgary, Alberta; Grand Prairie, Alberta; Carlyle, Saskatchewan; and Delta, British Columbia. In the US, CES’ main chemical manufacturing and reacting facility is located in Sterling, Kansas with additional low-temperature reacting and chemical blending capabilities just outside of Midland, Texas and chemical blending capabilities in Sonora, Texas. In Canada, CES has a chemical manufacturing and reacting facility located in Delta, British Columbia with additional chemical blending capabilities located in Carlyle, Saskatchewan, Nisku, Alberta, and Grand Prairie, Alberta. CES also leverages third party partner relationships to drive innovation in the consumable fluids and chemicals business.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">Total Energy</span>’s financial results for the three months ended September 30, 2018 represent the fifth consecutive profitable quarter for the Company. Underlying these results were improving energy service industry conditions in the United States and Australia, the realization of efficiencies of scale and cost synergies arising from the integration of <span class="companylink">Savanna Energy Services Corp</span>. (“Savanna”) and improved discipline in declining unprofitable work. Included in 2018 third quarter selling, general and administrative expenses was $0.6 million of legal expenses related to two claims made against Savanna following the takeover of Savanna by the Company.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">Total Energy</span>’s Contract Drilling Services segment (“CDS”) achieved 27% utilization during the third quarter of 2018, recording 2,836 operating days (spud to rig release) with a fleet of 116 drilling rigs, compared to 3,153 operating days, or 29% utilization, during the third quarter of 2017 with a fleet of 119 drilling rigs. Revenue per operating day for the third quarter of 2018 was $20,341, a 9% increase from the prior year comparable period. During the third quarter of 2018, the CDS segment had 1,687 operating days in Canada with a fleet of 86 rigs (21% utilization), 783 days in the United States with a fleet of 25 rigs (34% utilization) and 366 days in Australia with a fleet of 5 rigs (80% utilization).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Rental and Transportation Services segment (“RTS”) achieved a utilization rate on major rental equipment of 24% during the third quarter of 2018 which was consistent with the third quarter of 2017. Segment revenue per utilized rental piece decreased 2% during the third quarter of 2018 compared to the same period in 2017 due to a change in mix of equipment operating. This segment exited the third quarter of 2018 with approximately 11,000 pieces of major rental equipment (excluding access matting) and 112 heavy trucks as compared to 11,700 rental pieces and 125 heavy trucks at September 30, 2017.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Revenue in the Compression and Process Services segment (“<span class="companylink">CPS</span>”) increased 70% to $114.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2018 compared to $67.7 million for the same period in 2017. This increase was primarily due to higher international activity levels, including increasing contribution from the Weirton, West Virginia compression fabrication facility. This segment exited the third quarter of 2018 with a $236.7 million backlog of fabrication sales orders as compared to $160.7 million at September 30, 2017 and $216.9 million at June 30, 2018. At September 30, 2018, there was 45,500 horsepower in the compression rental fleet, of which approximately 31,500 horsepower was on rent as compared to 20,200 horsepower on rent at September 30, 2017 and 24,800 horsepower at June 30, 2018. The gas compression rental fleet operated at an average utilization rate of 69% during the third quarter of 2018 as compared to 46% during the third quarter of 2017.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">Total Energy</span>’s Well Servicing segment (“WS”) generated $41.0 million of revenue during the third quarter of 2018 on 44,447 service hours, or $922 per service hour, with a fleet of 83 service rigs that were located in Canada (57 rigs), the United States (14 rigs) and Australia (12 rigs). This compares to $39.3 million of revenue during the third quarter of 2017 on 41,256 service hours, or $952 per service hour. Service rig utilization for the three months ended September 30, 2018 was 39% in Canada, 37% in the United States and 71% in Australia.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">During the third quarter of 2018 <span class="companylink">Total Energy</span> repurchased 200,000 common shares at an average price (including commissions) of $11.69 per share pursuant to its normal course issuer bid and declared a quarterly dividend of $0.06 per share to shareholders of record on September 30, 2018. This dividend was paid on October 31, 2018. For Canadian income tax purposes, all dividends paid by <span class="companylink">Total Energy</span> on its common shares are designated as “eligible dividends” unless otherwise indicated.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Outlook</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Oil and natural gas industry activity levels continued to recover in the United States and Australia during the third quarter and current expectations are that such markets will remain relatively strong compared to 2017. Industry conditions remain stagnant in Canada, where oil and natural gas price discounts continue to be exacerbated by insufficient pipeline capacity. Current indications are that upcoming Canadian winter activity will be similar to last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In response to increasing domestic and international demand, as evidenced by its record fabrication sales backlog, the <span class="companylink">CPS</span> segment recently leased a 84,400 square foot fabrication facility in Calgary, Alberta that will replace an existing 24,800 square foot leased facility. This facility will increase Canadian fabrication space by approximately 30% to 246,600 square feet and plant production is expected to ramp up over the next two quarters.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Given continued weakness in Canadian oil and natural gas drilling and completion activity combined with higher labour, fuel and utility costs arising from regulatory changes in Alberta, five RTS branch locations have or will be closed by the end of 2018. These RTS branch closures are the first in <span class="companylink">Total Energy</span>’s 22-year history and are necessary to reduce this segment’s fixed cost structure given persistently lower Canadian industry activity levels and the inability to fully pass on higher operating costs to customers. Following these closures, the RTS segment will operate from 20 branches in western Canada.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">Total Energy</span>’s working capital position at September 30, 2018 was $117.6 million, including $27.9 million of cash and marketable securities. During the first nine months of 2018, the Company has reduced the principal amount of debt outstanding by $32.1 million and at September 30, 2018 $236.0 million was drawn on the Company’s $295.0 million of revolving bank credit facilities. <span class="companylink">Total Energy</span> was in compliance with all debt covenants at September 30, 2018 and able to fully draw on the remaining amounts available under its credit facilities. <span class="companylink">Total Energy</span>’s primary credit facility provides the Company with the option to increase such facility by $75 million subject to certain terms and conditions including the agreement of the lenders to increase their commitments.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">* EBITDA means earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization and is equal to net income before income taxes plus finance costs plus depreciation. EBITDA is not a recognized measure under IFRS. Management believes that in addition to net income, EBITDA is useful supplemental measure as it provides an indication of the results generated by the Company’s primary business activities prior to consideration of how those activities are financed, amortized or how the results are taxed in various jurisdictions as well as the cash generated by the Company’s primary business activities without consideration of the timing of the monetization of non-cash working capital items. Readers should be cautioned, however, that EBITDA should not be construed as an alternative to net income determined in accordance with IFRS as an indicator of <span class="companylink">Total Energy</span>’s performance. <span class="companylink">Total Energy</span>’s method of calculating EBITDA may differ from other organizations and, accordingly, EBITDA may not be comparable to measures used by other organizations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">* Working capital equals current assets minus current liabilities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">* Net Debt equals long-term debt plus obligations under finance leases plus current liabilities minus current assets.</p>

Mr. Paul Vander Valk, Chief Operating Officer, Oil Sands commented: “The BlackGold asset provides Harvest with a predictable, low decline, significant long-term asset and we are pleased with initial production and plant operations.”</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CALGARY — Production cutbacks and deferred drilling programs are emerging as a common theme as Calgary-based oil and gas companies elect to leave barrels in the ground rather than sell at current low prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In third-quarter results released this week, energy companies large and small say they are avoiding wider-than-usual price discounts compared with U.S. benchmark prices blamed on difficulty in getting barrels to market due to full export pipelines.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At least 110,000 barrels per day of potential oil production is being left behind, including cutbacks announced by major oilsands players <span class="companylink">Canadian Natural Resources Ltd</span>., <span class="companylink">Cenovus Energy Inc</span>. and <span class="companylink">MEG Energy Corp</span>. last week, calculates analyst Phil Skolnick, managing director with Eight Capital.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Storage is tight in Canada so it will help clear the storage levels or bring then down, which should then help the diffs (price differentials), and that will be 110,000 bpd that won't be trying to find a home on pipe right now."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He pointed out bitumen must be blended about three-to-one with diluent to flow in a pipeline so the reductions actually translate into a "meaningful" amount of reduced demand on the system.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a note on Monday, RBC analyst Greg Pardy estimated between 52,000 and 98,000 barrels per day wasn't being produced, a small portion of Canada's overall output of about 4.6 million barrels of oil per day and not enough to make a big difference in pricing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The cuts represent "a constructive start to reducing Alberta's elevated storage levels, but still fall well below our estimated supply-demand imbalance (after crude-by-rail exports of 250,000 bpd) of 160,000 to 185,000 bpd in the fourth quarter of 2018," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Wednesday after markets closed, <span class="companylink">Athabasca Oil Corp</span>. said it would dial back production at its two steam-driven oilsands projects by between 16 and 27 per cent to deal with wide discounts that it expects to persist until next spring.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Athabasca has responded to the widening differentials by strategically slowing production by 5,000 to 8,000 bpd for the balance of the year (November and December) at Hangingstone and Leismer," it said, noting third-quarter production of about 30,500 bpd, up eight per cent over the same period a year ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, Perpetual Energy Ltd. and <span class="companylink">Gear Energy Ltd</span>. are among companies that have announced they will defer planned drilling programs in the fourth quarter until next year in hopes that flush production from new wells will find more robust prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Gear added Thursday it plans to put 40,000 barrels of heavy oil into surface storage tanks to be sold at a later date.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"To shut down production, it actually costs money, it's not just a matter of turning off the valve," said Dinara Millington, vice-president of research for the Canadian Energy Research Institute.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"So there's going to be a decision, where's the net benefit larger? Is it shutting down production and eating that cost but then selling your future production for higher prices? Or is it continuing production ... and then incurring the cost of lower netbacks?"</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lower production translates into less money for government programs, she said, noting that provinces collect royalties based on how much petroleum is produced while lower profits mean less corporate income tax for federal coffers.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Street reacted swiftly to <span class="companylink">Freshii Inc</span>.'s ( FRII-T[https://beta.theglobeandmail.com/investing/markets/stocks/FRII-T/] ) decision to withdraw of its 2019 fiscal outlook in the wake of weaker-than-anticipated third-quarter results with a trio of equity analysts downgrading their ratings for its stock.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Wednesday, the Toronto-based company reported same-store sales growth of negative 0.8 per cent, a steep decline from a rise of 5.1-per-cent in the same period a year ago. Adjusted EBITDA also fell year-over-year to $1.4-million from $1.5-million, despite a 26-per-cent rise in system-wide sales, due partially to a rise in store count.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With the results, <span class="companylink">Freshii</span> pulled back its 2019 outlook, noting in a release: “Management has now determined that certain of its assumptions relating to its outlook for system-wide store count, system-wide sales, selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of system-wide sales and Adjusted Pro Forma EBITDA are no longer valid and that it cannot maintain the Company’s outlook in respect of these measure.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That decision prompted RBC Dominion Securities analyst Sabahat Khan to lower its stock to “underperform” from “sector perform” with a target of $3, dropping from $7. The average on the Street is currently $6.22, according to Bloomberg data.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Canaccord Genuity's Derek Dley moved the stock to "hold" from "buy" with a $4 target, down from $9.50.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CIBC World Markets' John Zamparo dropped it to "underperform" from "neutral" with a $2.75 target, falling from $5.26.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Don’t pass on” <span class="companylink">Pason Systems Inc</span>. ( PSI-T[https://beta.theglobeandmail.com/investing/markets/stocks/PSI-T/] ), said Industrial Alliance analyst Elias Foscolos following the release of third-quarter results that “pulverized” expectations on the Street.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He raised his rating for the Calgary-based provider of data management systems for drilling rigs to "buy" from "hold."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Wednesday after market close, Pason reported revenue of $82-million, a jump of 28 per cent year-over-year and exceeding the projections of both Mr. Foscolos ($80-million) and the Street ($78-million). "Unprecedented" adjusted EBITDA of $42-million also easily topped expectations ($37-million and $35-million, respectively), an incremental jump of almost 80 per cent due largely to "strong" growth across all its operating segments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With the results, Mr. Foscolos raised his revenue and EBITDA projections for both fiscal 2018 and 2019, leading to increased earnings per share estimates for both years (71 cents and 83 cents, respectively, from 57 cents and 65 cents).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">His target price for <span class="companylink">Pason Systems</span> shares rose to $23.75 from $20. The average target is $24.65.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">=====</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A recent pullback in <span class="companylink">Yangarra Resources Ltd</span>.'s ( YGR-T[https://beta.theglobeandmail.com/investing/markets/stocks/YGR-T/] ) share price presents a buying opportunity for investors, according to Canaccord Genuity analyst Anthony Petrucci, who upgraded his rating to “buy” from “speculative buy.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Wednesday after market close, the Calgary-based company reported production for the third quarter of 10,323 barrels of oil equivalent per day, exceeding Mr. Petrucci's estimate (9,960 boe/d) and in line with consensus expectations. He feels the company seems "well on pace" to reach its production target of 9,000 to 10,000 boe/d.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Cash flow per share of 34 cents also topped expectations, beating the 30-cent estimate of Mr. Petrucci and 29-cent consensus projection.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Cash costs, including opex, transport and G&A, continue to trend lower as the company grows its production base," the analyst said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Along with the release, YGR announced an increase in its capital budget (from $120-million to $140-million), citing a shorter-than-usual break-up period. With significant increases in production (more than 10,000 boe/d) and debt deleveraging (0.7 times 2019 estimate debt-to-cash flow), the risk profile of YGR has declined, we are now increasing our rating."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Petrucci maintained a target price for Yangarra shares of $7, which sits 95 cents lower than the consensus.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"YGR offers significant growth potential at a discounted cashflow valuation, which is supported by a healthy 2P NAV," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"YGR is trading at a 2019 estimated enterprise value-to-debt-adjusted cash floe of 2.5 times and a 2019 estimated D/CF of 0.7 times, versus its peer group at 4.4 times and 2.5 times, respectively. We believe YGR's discount is unwarranted given its growth profile, balance sheet strength, and asset base."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Since adding <span class="companylink">B2Gold</span> to the Analyst Current Favourites list on October 4, 2018, the company’s share price has increased 12.2 per cent, outperforming the VanEck Vectors Gold Miners ETF (ARCA:GDX) by 9.6 per cent,” he said. “While we still view <span class="companylink">B2Gold</span>’s valuation relative to peers to be compelling, the significant outperformance, over a short time frame, drives the removal.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Hassan maintained a target of $4.50 and "outperform" rating for <span class="companylink">B2Gold</span> shares. The average on the Street is $5.07.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">=====</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Raymond James analyst Ken Avalos lowered his rating for <span class="companylink">First Capital Realty Inc</span>. ( FCR-T[https://beta.theglobeandmail.com/investing/markets/stocks/fcr-T/] ) to “outperform” from “strong buy” in order to bring it in-line with other top retail real estate investment trusts, particularly RioCan ( REI.UN-T[https://beta.theglobeandmail.com/investing/markets/stocks/REI-UN-T/] ) and Crombie ( CRR.UN-T[https://beta.theglobeandmail.com/investing/markets/stocks/CRR-UN-T/] ).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We now carry our three buy-rated retail names at Outperform, reserving our Strong Buy rating for more population-driven real estate (multi-family, self-storage, death care),” he said. “That said, we continue to recommend that investors acquire shares at these levels, given the retail-leading SPNOI [same property net operating income] and NAV [net asset value] growth and 14-per-cent NAV discount (largely in-line with the two aforementioned peers).”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Tuesday, Toronto-based First Capital reported third-quarter funds from operations of 30 cents per share, up 1 per cent year over year but a penny below the expectations of both Mr. Avalos and the Street. Occupancy rose 0.2 per cent to 96.5 per cent, its highest level since the fourth quarter of 2011.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Despite the value we see in the name, it would be disingenuous if we didn’t comment on the largest risk we see at the moment, Gazit’s 30-per-cent majority position,” said Mr. Avalos. “With Gazit divesting of its Regency Centres position and publicly stating that they’d like to revert to owning solely direct real estate, it in effect creates a ceiling on the name until there is a transition in ownership of those shares.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Avalos lowered his target for the REIT by a loonie to $22. The average is 43 cents higher.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“SPNOI results and FFO growth continue to be solid, and NAV growth via developments visible and financeable given the strong balance sheet,” he said. “We continue to recommend investors add shares given the compelling NAV discount and high quality portfolio.”</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Following “weak” third-quarter results, Industrial Alliance Securities analyst Nav Malik downgraded <span class="companylink">AirBoss of America Corp</span>. ( BOS-T[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/investing/markets/stocks/BOS-T/] ) to “hold” from “buy.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“While we upgraded the stock to a BUY last month following the announcement of new Defense contracts, our outlook for the Automotive segment has deteriorated due to recent, and likely ongoing, margin weakness,” he said. “In addition, the macro environment remains challenging with uncertainty in global trading relationships, raw material volatility, and higher costs serving as headwinds on AirBoss' financial performance.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Malik dropped his target to $11.50 from $14. The average is $15.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">=====</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Though he thinks the early signs of the reorganization of assets in the George Weston-Loblaw group of companies “appear positive” for <span class="companylink">Loblaw Companies Ltd</span>. ( L-T[https://beta.theglobeandmail.com/investing/markets/stocks/L-T/] ) shareholders, <span class="companylink">Desjardins Securities</span> analyst Keith Howlett dropped his target price for the stock ahead of the Nov. 14 release of quarterly results to account for the removal of Choice REIT from his estimates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Loblaw will be a less complex entity now that it has spun out Choice REIT,” he said. “Rent expense will become a sizeable item on the income statement, and is the driver behind our reduced EPS estimates for 4Q and 2019. Previously, the rent paid by Loblaw to Choice REIT disappeared on consolidation of the subsidiary’s financial statements. Choice REIT is now controlled directly by <span class="companylink">George Weston</span>. The new structure will free Choice REIT to expand its horizons beyond food-anchored retail sites, and to obtain full value from the recent acquisition of CREIT and its executive management team. Now that it has a substantial free cash flow from Choice REIT, <span class="companylink">George Weston</span> has the financial means to add a “fourth leg” to its portfolio of businesses (Loblaw, Choice, baking). The holding company discount applied to <span class="companylink">George Weston</span> does appear to have widened with the reorganization. We calculate it at 12.7 per cent at present, above the historical range of 6.5– 8.5 per cent (as calculated by the financial adviser to the board).”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Howlett dropped his earnings per share projections for 2018 and 2019 to $4.38 and $4.04, respectively, from $4.64 and $5.18.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With a “buy” rating, his target fell to $62 from $77. The average is $63.99.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We are seeking confirmation in 3Q results that Loblaw is continuing to adhere to its operational and financial model, and will generate consistent and good results,” he said. “Once firmly on this course, the company has solid underlying assets that it will be able to tap to accelerate growth.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">=====</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Calling it a “best-in-class” gold equity, Industrial Alliance Securities analyst George Topping initiated coverage of <span class="companylink">Franco-Nevada Corp</span>. ( FNV-T[https://beta.theglobeandmail.com/investing/markets/stocks/fnv-T/] ) with a “buy” rating.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Since the firm’s IPO in December 2007, Franco has had a 463-per-cent return while the cyclic gold price returned 38 per cent, and other gold equities, as measured by the S&P/TSX Global Gold Index, have returned an appalling negative 48 per cent,” said Mr. Topping. “Franco’s business model shields it from the ebbs and flows of the gold market, thus it has been a consistent outperformer. With more than 80 per cent of its portfolio in precious metal royalties/streams, a gold price rally would drive revenue growth.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He set a target price of $105, which slightly higher than the consensus of $104.65.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The royalty/streaming business model is low risk and allows Franco to limit its exposure to capital, operating, and other costs faced by traditional miners,” the analyst said. “As such, it deserves and receives a premium valuation. The sheer size of Franco’s portfolio compared to other royalty peers', exposure to O&G, provide diversification and further reduce risk to any one particular asset.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">=====</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Citing “the challenged Alberta differential environment, which we do not see improving until late Q1/19," <span class="companylink">AltaCorp Capital</span> analyst Thomas Matthews downgraded <span class="companylink">Bonterra Energy Corp</span>. ( BNE-T[https://beta.theglobeandmail.com/investing/markets/stocks/BNE-T/] ) to “sector perform” from “outperform” and lowered his target to $21 from $23. The average is $20.36.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Matthews also lowered Peyto Exploration and Development Corp. ( PEY-T[https://beta.theglobeandmail.com/investing/markets/stocks/PEY-T/] ) to “sector perform” from “outperform,” seeing “cheaper valuations and higher potential for oil-weighted names with pending improvement to western Canadian oil-differentials.” His target rose to $14.25 from $13.50, exceeding the $13.10 average.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">TD Securities</span>’ Aaron Bilkoski also downgraded Peyto to “hold” from “buy,” keeping a $12 target.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Industrial Alliance Securities analyst Michael Charlton downgraded <span class="companylink">Prairie Provident Resources Inc</span>. ( PPR-T[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/investing/markets/stocks/PPR-T/] ) to “speculative buy” from “buy.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We recognize Prairie Provident is trading at a discount to its estimated pro-forma PDP value of $1.29 per share, however given the increase in debt and uncertainty with regards to the 2019 capital program and commodity price differentials, we believe the risk in this stock has increased and have adjusted our valuations accordingly,” he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Charlton dropped his target to 60 cents from 90 cents. The average is $1.18.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">=====</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Raymond James analyst Frederic Bastien upgraded <span class="companylink">Bird Construction Inc</span>. ( BDT-T[https://beta.theglobeandmail.com/investing/markets/stocks/BDT-T/] ) to “strong buy” from “outperform” with a target of $10.50. The average is $10.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Bastien said: “Our selection of <span class="companylink">Bird Construction</span> as one of Raymond James' Best Picks for 2018 has proved a humbling experience-to put mildly. Just when we thought it was poised to rebound from a challenging 2017, the contractor successively suffered from a commercial dispute, rigid accounting changes, a labour strike and outright investor apathy toward Canadian small cap stocks. But with financial results stabilizing and momentum for the firm’s industrial business continuing, rarely has it been as good a time to pick up the Bird as now, in our view. Accordingly we are upgrading the common shares.”</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SAINT JOHN, N.B. — It's been a tough month for one of Canada's wealthiest families.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Irvings of New Brunswick are facing renewed scrutiny after a major industrial accident at the <span class="companylink">Irving Oil</span> refinery in Saint John — one month ago Thursday — and three guilty pleas the following day from Irving Pulp and Paper for polluting the Saint John River.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The sudden spate of bad publicity has drawn into sharp focus the delicate relationship between the Irving group of companies and the 69,000 residents of Saint John.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Irvings are one of the city's largest employers, and the family's privately owned companies are thought to be worth about $8 billion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">No one was seriously hurt by the refinery blast, but residents were reminded that it was the fourth explosion at Canada's largest oil refinery in 20 years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As for the pulp and paper mill, owned by <span class="companylink">J.D. Irving Ltd</span>., it was hit this week with one of largest penalties ever imposed in Canada for an environmental violation: $3.5 million. Fines for charges related to polluting were imposed on the same mill in 1999, 2009 and 2010.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The city's mayor, Don Darling, has said Saint John's large industrial base comes with risks, and he has called for a broader discussion about the relationship between residents and industry.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He also drew attention to another incident in January, when a butane leak near the refinery forced the evacuation of businesses on at least two streets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We have a very, very high concentration of industry here in Saint John and I think we've gone through a series of butane leaks and explosions and fires, and I think it has people very nervous and rightly so," Darling said shortly after the latest explosion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Irving Oil spokeswoman Candice MacLean said the company, which employs more than 2,200 people in the province, is a "safe, secure and reliable energy supplier."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We are steadfastly committed to our employees and our customers and continue to invest millions of dollars each year to build stronger communities in our home province and across Atlantic Canada," MacLean said in a statement, adding that the company generates over 50 per cent of New Brunswick's export trade at $5 billion annually.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Gordon Dalzell, a clean-air advocate in Saint John, said the Irving group plays a critically important role in the New Brunswick economy, but its economic might exacts a toll on the province.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"In a small city like Saint John, you quickly find out that many of your neighbours and their family members work for Irving," he said in a recent interview. "Very few people will speak out ... to keep them accountable or to criticize some of their practices."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dalzell estimates the Irvings employ about 35,000 people across the province.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"You can't go too hard on these guys because they play such an important economic role," said Dalzell, who has lived near the refinery since 1979. "But we do pay a price for that ... When you look at Saint John, it's like a big industrial park."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Gerry Lowe, a former city councillor who now represents Saint John Harbour in the provincial legislature for the Liberals, says dealing with the Irving family can be intimidating — but that hasn't stopped him from speaking out.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"People don't know what is going on because they are a very private family," said Lowe. "It creates so many rumours."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As privately owned companies, the Irvings' holdings are not subject to the same scrutiny as publicly held enterprises. In fact, estimates about the family's combined wealth are just guesses, based on a limited amount of public information.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When he was on council, Lowe fought against a tax deal that capped the property tax on <span class="companylink">Irving Oil</span>'s Canaport liquefied natural gas plant.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"People were saying, 'You shouldn't do that, (Arthur Irving) will move the LNG terminal.'' Lowe said. "That's the first thing you'll hear from people who are timid."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Emma Seamone, spokeswoman for the Sierra Club Canada Foundation, said there isn't enough scrutiny of the Irvings' businesses because the family owns all of the English-language daily newspapers in the province.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's really hard to question Irving in the media and get that message out," said Seamone, chairwoman of the Atlantic chapter's executive committee and a former resident of Saint John.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">However, the Irving newspapers are not the only media outlets in the province. The CBC, for example, has kept a close watch on the Irvings' dealings over the years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And the newspaper group, owned by J.K. Irving, has made a point of asserting its editorial independence.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Brunswick News is run by a competent, independent team that determines content," said spokeswoman Mary Keith. "Its journalists have won numerous awards for the quality reporting."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Irving group of companies used to be controlled by the family's patriarch, K.C. Irving. But the conglomerate has been split up over the last decade between his three sons: Arthur, J.K. and Jack, who died in 2010.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">David Duplisea, spokesman for the Saint John Region Chamber of Commerce, declined a request for an interview.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Both of these companies (<span class="companylink">J.D. Irving Ltd</span> and <span class="companylink">Irving Oil Ltd</span>.) are extremely important to our region and our province," he said in an email. "They are important for our economic well-being and they contribute immensely to philanthropic and community efforts as well."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Just over a year ago, <span class="companylink">Irving Oil</span> was dealt a blow when Calgary-based <span class="companylink">TransCanada Corp</span>. cancelled its $15.7-billion proposed Energy East pipeline, which would have carried Alberta crude to the Saint John refinery. A local business group estimated the project would have added thousands of jobs and $6.5 billion to the provincial economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Darling has said his once-affluent city — the oldest incorporated city in Canada — was looking to Energy East as a source of momentum to get the local economy moving again.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite the setback, <span class="companylink">Irving Oil</span> remains a pivotal player in the province's economy — a fact likely not lost on the province's next premier, Blaine Higgs. The Progressive Conservative leader, who will be sworn in on Friday, worked for <span class="companylink">Irving Oil</span> for 33 years before he retired and turned to politics.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">Mediacorp Canada Inc</span>., the largest publisher of employment periodicals in Canada, selected <span class="companylink">Irving Oil</span> as one of Canada's Top 100 Employers this year, citing its maternity and parental leave top-ups, academic scholarships and its commitment to diversity and inclusion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The company also supports a number of charities, including the Fuel the Care program, which covers fuel-related travel expenses for a sick child's medical treatment. The program has helped more than 50,000 families across Atlantic Canada, Quebec, and New England in the past 15 years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Keith, who is a spokeswoman for <span class="companylink">J.D. Irving Ltd</span>., offered a lengthy emailed response when asked about the renewed focus on the Irvings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Regarding the company's economic strength, Keith cited 2017 statistics indicating the 8,000 people who work for <span class="companylink">J.D. Irving Ltd</span>. earn salaries that are, on average, 45 per cent higher than the provincial average for full-time workers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The company estimates that it indirectly supports another 9,000 jobs across the province, bringing its contribution to the economy to about $1 billion in employment income in 2017.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She said the company is also known for supporting hundreds of events, scholarships and non-profit organizations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As well, she said <span class="companylink">J.D. Irving Ltd</span>. has a well-earned reputation for stepping up to help when disaster strikes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Earlier this year, when the Saint John River flooded several communities, more than 150 JDI employees volunteered to fill more than 122,000 sand bags. The company helped keep the pharmacy in Chipman, N.B., open by airlifting in the pharmacist, and when the only way in or out of a west side community was by train, the company sent in an engine and passenger cars to help with evacuations.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Toronto is no slouch, either. Nor is Montreal, the other city to round out the top 10 in an annual ranking by Century 21 Canada.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This comes amid concerns in Canada over affordability in some centres, notably the Vancouver and Toronto areas, and after federal and provincial measures aimed at cooling inflated prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Indeed, a new <span class="companylink">National Bank of Canada</span> study released today showed affordability getting even worse in the third quarter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some regional highlights from Cent:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">British Columbia: “Going back 20 years most Metro Vancouver prices have tripled or quadrupled - to $681 [price per square foot] this year from $192 in 1998 in North Vancouver, for example.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Alberta: “Alberta real estate prices have been soft over the last year, falling in most communities while rising in very few.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prairies: “The price per square foot of homes across much of Saskatchewan and Manitoba retracted in the last year after two decades of growth. Only Winnipeg bucked the trend, with prices for a detached house there rising to $282 from $267 per square foot while prices in Regina and Saskatoon saw modest declines.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ontario: Prices in downtown Toronto climbed more than 10 per cent over the past year and “continue to top Ontario home prices, while prices rose and fell turbulently in GTA suburbs and other communities in the province.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Eastern Canada: Prices “have risen moderately in the last year even while other parts of Canada faced more variable real estate markets.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">National Bank</span> study showed affordability worsening in nine of 10 markets tracked, despite an easing in home prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Expensive housing markets such as Vancouver and Toronto slowed down markedly in 2018, and home prices even declined in Q3 due to the combined effect of rising mortgage rates (up for a fifth consecutive quarter) and macro prudential measures,” said <span class="companylink">National Bank</span>’s Matthieu Arsenau and Kyle Dahms.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Despite lower home prices, homebuyer affordability failed to improve as wages were down in those markets.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Montreal and Ottawa area markets, which have been on fire, suffered the “sharpest deteriorations in affordability” in the quarter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“But for another reason: Home prices surged respectively by 2.1 per cent and 2.5 per cent quarter over quarter,” said Mr. Arsenau and Mr. Dahms.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“These markets appear to be unaffected by rising interest rates and tighter credit standards as shown by resale market conditions being strongly tilted in favour of sellers.”</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Calgary's bid for the 2026 Winter Olympics hinges on a plan to avoid the cost overruns that have plagued past Games by buying an insurance policy, but some on city council have questioned whether it would be worth the cost.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With the price tag for the Calgary Games expected to reach $5.1-billion – $3billion of which would need to come from the public sector – the federal and Alberta governments have said they will not cover any cost overruns.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Without the backing of a senior level of government, Calgary's bid commits the city to paying for an insurance plan to cover $200-million in unforeseen costs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The insurance comes along with a nearly $1-billion cushion built into the bid's cost to cover potential overruns.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Calgary 2026 bid corporation told council's Olympic committee on Tuesday that the city's insurance broker has confirmed a $20-million or 10-per-cent premium should cover the required plan if a company can be found to provide it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We've been given some assurance by Calgary 2026 that this is possible," city manager Jeff Fielding told the council committee.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The search for an insurance plan is happening as Calgarians prepare to vote in a Nov. 13 plebiscite on whether the city should pursue the Games. The vote has become a divisive issue in Calgary as campaigns in favour and opposed have duked it out in public forums.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Speaking at council on Tuesday, councillor Peter Demong expressed reservations about the cost of the city's plan to secure insurance, which is expected to also include a further 10-per-cent deductible before the insurance would take effect.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Demong said he was bothered by information provided to council by the bid corporation about two exclusions from any insurance plan: Money would not be paid out if costs went over budget as a result of changes in any project or because of overruns caused by contractors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Why would we go down this route if the exclusions are basically the areas that the majority of overruns come from? If scope changes aren't included, change orders aren't included, overruns by contractors aren't included, what is included then?" he asked the city's bid corporation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to Calgary 2026, any insurance would cover overruns caused by the weather, labour unrest and unforeseen environmental issues, among a number of other potential problems.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Councillor Jeremy Farkas, an opponent of hosting the Games, also expressed concern on Tuesday about whether the insurance plan would be useful when the city actually needed it. “It's like buying health insurance that doesn't kick in if you get sick," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to Trevor Tombe, an economist at the University of Calgary, Olympics tend to generate cost overruns.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Overruns happen all the time. For the past half-century, all Games have gone over their initially projected cost," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to Mr. Tombe, one of the risks facing the city's bid would be a rebound in the price of oil that would jumpstart the province's economy and lead to a rapid escalation in labour costs.</p>

Volker Turk is in Ottawa to meet with Canadian border officials today, and says Canada's spike in asylum seekers is nothing compared to the millions that pour every year into countries in the global south. As for whether Canada should continue to view the U.S. as a safe country for refugees in light of Donald Trump's verbal attacks against the migrant caravan, Turk says regardless of political hot air, the U.S. continues to have a "robust" asylum system with checks and balances. 600 words.

<span class="companylink">Desjardins Securities</span> analyst Doug Young feels current valuations for Canadian banks “still appear reasonable” given the other investment alternatives.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“While Canadian bank stock prices decreased 5.8 per cent during 4Q FY18, on average the group still outperformed the S&P/TSX as well as the Canadian and U.S. lifeco average and U.S. bank index,” said Mr. Young. “CM was the best-performing Canadian bank (down 4.2 per cent) while CWB underperformed materially (down 16.1 per cent, negatively impacted by market sentiment on mortgage loan growth, NIM expansion and branch-raised deposits).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The Big 6 Canadian banks are on average trading below their 20-year historical average P/4QF EPS multiples. There are some tailwinds for the Canadian banks over the near term: (1) rising rates in Canada and the U.S.; (2) higher levels of capital; (3) decent expense control, an important lever as loan growth slows; and (4) a benign credit environment. In addition, the banks have been able to effectively manage a number of headwinds over the past few years, such as a drop in oil prices and new regulatory capital rules. However, we also acknowledge a number of risks on the horizon, such as operating in the late stages of the economic cycle, volatility in the equity markets, higher volatility of provisions under IFRS 9 and the impact of higher rates on the Canadian consumer.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a research note previewing the fourth quarter for the banking sector, Mr. Young said he’s projecting cash earnings per share growth of 9 per cent year over year, a “slight deceleration” from 11 per cent on the previous quarter. In explaining the slowdown, he pointed to U.S. tax reforms, increasing interest rates (on both sides of the border), “decent” loan growth, acquisitions, “what appears to be a benign credit environment” and share buybacks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ahead of the start of earnings schedule, which <span class="companylink">Bank of Nova Scotia</span> is set to kick off on Nov. 27, Mr. Young lowered his target prices for stocks in the sector in order to “reflect higher risk.”</p>

<span class="companylink">Laurentian Bank of Canada</span> ( LB-T[https://beta.theglobeandmail.com/investing/markets/stocks/LB-T/] , “hold”) to $45 from $47. Average: $47.67.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Despite decent results thus far in FY18, bank stocks are down 5.4 per cent year-to-date on average, although this is better than the 6.1-per-cent drop for the S&P/TSX,” the analyst said. “Macroeconomic volatility and an indebted Canadian consumer remain the primary concerns. However, with the Big 6 trading below historical average forward P/E multiples, reasonable FY19 EPS growth forecasts and a decent economic backdrop for now (rising interest rates, low unemployment, etc), we remain comfortable with our neutral view.”</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ahead of Thursday’s release of its third-quarter financial results before market open, Raymond James analyst Kenric Tyghe lowered his target price for shares of <span class="companylink">Canadian Tire Corp. Ltd</span>. ( CTC.A-T[https://beta.theglobeandmail.com/investing/markets/stocks/CTC-A-T/] ) after shrinking his same-store sales growth estimates for both its Canadian Tire Retail and FGL Sports segments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The revisions to our 3Q18 and 2018 estimates largely reflect our (i) increased concerns on bigger ticket purchases, (ii) further possible share losses in sporting goods, and (iii) the imputed increased risk to CTFS on the current state of the consumer,” he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Tyghe now a 10.4-per-cent jump in revenues to $3.606-billion, slightly exceeding the consensus on the Street of $3.578-billion. He expects a 4.5-per-cent drop in adjusted EBITDA to $409.4-million, falling from his previous estimate of $431.5-million and slightly above the consensus of US$406.4-million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">His same-store sales estimate for Canadian Tire’s retail segment fell to 1.8 per cent from 2.3 per cent, while his FGL projection dropped from 2.1 per cent to 1.5 per cent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Maintaining an “outperform” rating, his target dipped to $181 from $198. The average is $184.08.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">=====</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Following “weak” quarterly results that led to a “significant" reduction in his financial estimates, <span class="companylink">BMO</span> Nesbitt Burns analyst Ben Pham downgraded <span class="companylink">Keyera Corp</span>. ( KEY-T[https://beta.theglobeandmail.com/investing/markets/stocks/KEY-T/] ) to “market perform” from “outperform.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“To be clear, we are still positive on the long-term outlook, particularly if KEY is successful in expanding its service offering to include liquids transportation from the Montney to Fort Saskatchewan,” said Mr. Pham. “However, the abysmal Alberta gas price, frac fee compression, and lower-than-expected returns on new growth prompted us to recalibrate our estimates lower. As such, we now sit 6-7 per cent below consensus.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He lowered his target to $36 from $43. The average is $41.73.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">=====</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The recent selloff in <span class="companylink">Hardwoods Distribution Inc</span>. ( HDI-T[https://beta.theglobeandmail.com/investing/markets/stocks/HDI-T/] ) is “overdone,” according to Acumen Capital analyst Nick Corcoran, who views it as an opportunity for investors despite Monday’s release of “mixed” third-quarter financial results.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“While the margin pressure from the U.S. trade case and general sentiment against building products has weighed on the stock, we remind investors that demand for hardwood products is generally less cyclical and HDI has a solid plan to grow organically and through acquisitions,” said Mr. Corcoran.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Langley, B.C.-based distributor of building products reported a 11.9-per-cent jump in sales year over year to $290.4-million, exceeding the projections of both Mr. Corcoran ($278.1-million) and the Street ($294-million). However, adjusted EBITDA of $15.2-million missed the $15.7-million estimate of both the analyst and the consensus.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Management was optimistic about the outlook and highlighted that it has a diversified product mix of new residential, remodeling, commercial and other,” said Mr. Corcoran. “While the sentiment has largely shifted against building products, hardwood products are specialized, higher value, and have firmer pricing (especially when compared to softwood).”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Management reiterated its expectations of mid- to high-single digit organic growth in U.S. and low-single digit organic growth in Canada. Gross profit margin is expected to remain below the 18-19-per-cent target range through year-end (versus previous expectations that it would recover in H2/18). With a mixed outlook for housing, Management indicated that it is well diversified with approximately 50 per cent of its products used in residential construction, 30 per cent in non-residential construction, and 20 per cent used in other diversified end-markets.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite maintaining a “buy” target for its stock, Mr. Corcoran lowered his target to $19.50 from $23. The average is $21.69.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">=====</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Though its third-quarter results fell below his expectations, due largely to start-up problems at its new Entwistle facility, <span class="companylink">BMO</span> Nesbitt Burns analysts Jonathan Lamers upgraded <span class="companylink">Pinnacle Renewable Holdings Inc</span>. ( PL-T[https://beta.theglobeandmail.com/investing/markets/stocks/PL-T/] ) to “outperform” from “market perform” with an $18 target. The average is $18.56.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Pinnacle offers substantial earnings growth, remains meaningfully discounted to industry peer Enviva, and there have been a number of positive developments to-date providing near-term opportunities that we believe are not reflected in the stock,” he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">=====</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Though it reported “solid” quarterly results, Canaccord Genuity analyst Brendon Abrams downgraded Slate Office REIT ( SOT-UN-T[https://beta.theglobeandmail.com/investing/markets/stocks/SOT-UN-T/] ) to “hold” from “buy," believing the quarter was "overshadowed by its investment activity and proposed distribution plans.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“In Q3/18, the REIT closed on the acquisition of 120 South LaSalle Street, a 656,000 square foot office building located in downtown Chicago for US$155-million. This was the REIT’s second purchase in the city in 2018, bringing its acquisition total to $500-million year-to-date,” he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“While we like the U.S. acquisitions, as they act to high-grade Slate’s portfolio quality and cash flow stability, we are concerned by the near-term pressure put on the REIT’s balance sheet (D/GBV of 64 per cent) and payout ratio (110 per cent of AFFO). While the REIT intends to reduce leverage through asset sales in the range of ~$300 million, we believe relying on asset dispositions of this magnitude has increased the REIT’s risk profile given the uncertainty relating to the timing and value of assets to be sold.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Taking a “more cautious stance” on the REIT as he monitors “the execution of its disposition program and its progress towards a stronger financial profile," Mr. Abrams dropped his target to $7.75 from $8.50. The average is $8.10.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">=====</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Though he holds a “conservative” outlook ahead of the release of its third-quarter financial results on Nov. 14, Industrial Alliance Securities analyst Elias Foscolos initiated coverage of <span class="companylink">Tervita Corp</span>. ( TEV-T[https://beta.theglobeandmail.com/investing/markets/stocks/TEV-T/] ) with a “buy” rating.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Calgary-based Tervita was formed from the recent merger of <span class="companylink">Newalta Corp</span>. and <span class="companylink">Tervita Corp</span>., and began trading on the TSX in mid-July.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Tervita is poised to show EBITDA growth in 2019 irrespective of drilling activity,” said Mr. Foscolos. “Growth will be achieved through a combination of (a) reduced costs resulting from streamlining operating and overhead costs, and (b) a return to investing in organic capital projects which were deferred due to historically stretched balance sheets.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Foscolos is projecting EBITDA for the third quarter of $52-million, which sits below the $59-million consensus on the Street, adding: “For 2019 our conservative EBITDA projection is based on recent widening oil price differentials, which are predicted to curtail drilling activity in 2019. However, these wide differentials may benefit TEV’s Energy Marketing division.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He set a target price of $11 for Tervita shares. The average is $12.23.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">=====</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Raymond James analyst Ben Cherniavsky thinks the risk-return for shares of <span class="companylink">Finning International Inc</span>. ( FTT-T[https://beta.theglobeandmail.com/investing/markets/stocks/FTT-T/] ) is now “materially more attractive today than it was earlier this year when it traded near $35.00.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Finning’s 18e P/E multiple has now compressed to trough levels, thus deflating much of the valuation risk that previously concerned us,” he added. “Cyclically-adjusted P/E multiples similarly suggest that valuation risk is low at present.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Monday, the Vancouver-based distributor of <span class="companylink">Caterpillar</span> products and support services reported third-quarter eanrings per share of 45 cents, topped Mr. Cherniavsky’s expectations by a penny and rising 10 cents from the previous quarter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“3Q18 backlog of $1.5-billion is up 67 per cent year-over-year but flat quarter-over-quarter, indicating a deceleration of growth and the challenge of lapping increasingly tougher comps,” he said. “For cyclical sectors like machinery, this represents the pressing question that investors have been asking lately: is this the peak? We don’t think so, not yet at least. We expect machine sales growth to slow next year but assume healthy higher-margin <span class="companylink">CSS</span> activity as the aftermarket cycle runs its course. We also expect 2019 free cash flow to accelerate, supporting a deleveraging of the balance sheet and—possibly— further buybacks beyond the $100 mln repurchases program planned for 2018.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With an “outperform” rating, Mr. Cherniavksy lowered his target to $35 from $38.50. The average is $36.25.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Elsewhere, CIBC World Marketrs' Jacob Bout lowered his target to $38 from $41 with an "outperformer" rating (unchanged).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Bout said: “While we are taking down our numbers slightly due to weakness in Argentina (5 per cent of FTT sales), backlog is up 67 per cent year-over-year and end-market demand in Western Canada (September order intake was the highest on record in 2018) and Chile (13-per-cent year-over-year product support growth) continues to be robust. We continue to believe FTT will benefit from operating leverage on a reduced cost base, which should see margins and ROIC levels expand in 2019.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">=====</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Citing a deceleration in sales growth for its branded segment, <span class="companylink">BMO</span> Nesbitt Burns analyst Peter Sklar downgraded <span class="companylink">Jamieson Wellness Inc</span>.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A Democrat-controlled House will hamper Trump’s pro-business agenda and could lead to uncertainty about his administration, but few worry about a reversal in already-enforced corporate tax cuts and deregulation measures that have played a large hand in the U.S. market’s rally since the 2016 election.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The results for the Republicans were no worse than feared and pointed to a political gridlock that was largely expected by investors, leaving them free to buy back into a market that had its worst month in seven years in October.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Given what futures are pointing to right now, I think it’s probably a sign that on balance Republicans have marginally outperformed,” said Geoffrey Yu, head of U.K. Chief Investment Office at UBS Global Wealth Management.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The big question from here is do we add risk. Given how weak markets were in October, there is a slightly stronger case for us to outperform in the short-term.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Markets always prefer certainty and with the election over, investors can focus on their next moves.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The good news in a way for markets is that there was an uncertainty that’s now been removed. We know where we stand for the next two years, and investors will focus back on the fundamentals, which are (company) earnings growth and the economy,” said Guy Miller, chief market strategist at Zurich Insurance Group.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Even with a split government, I expect more fiscal stimulus ahead. There is some possibility for compromise on infrastructure spending as well,” said Steve Friedman, a senior economist at BNP Paribas Asset Management.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Attention will also focus on Trump’s hard line on trade tariffs, which he can impose without Congressional approval. That keeps alive worries about a trade war between China and the United States.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We would argue that if Trump can do less on the domestic front, he is more likely to focus on external matters such as trade, which will impact risk sentiment,” said Patrick O’Donnell, investment manager at Aberdeen Asset Management in London.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Tuesday, markets closed higher in anticipation of the outcome of the U.S. midterm elections.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sylvain Goyon, head of equity strategy at the Oddo brokerage in Paris, said many investors had been on the sidelines before the election, due to what he called “an uncertainty premium,”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Now it’s behind us, there’s a good reason for them to get back to the market,” he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Most analysts agree the newly empowered House Democrats will have the ability to investigate Trump’s tax returns, possible business conflicts of interest and allegations involving his 2016 campaign’s links to Russia.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Moreover, a split Congress will be able to hamper Trump’s push for a further round of tax cuts and deregulation – measures that have turbo-charged the U.S. economy, stock markets and the dollar.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Russia’s TASS news agency, citing an unnamed source, reported that the two countries, the biggest producers in an <span class="companylink">OPEC</span>-led alliance that has been limiting supply since 2017, have started bilateral talks on the issue.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I think this is a little bit of verbal intervention, trying to get some speculative length back into the market,” said analyst Olivier Jakob of Petromatrix. “The global supply and demand balance does not look very tight next year.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Brent crude, the global benchmark, rose US$1.04 to US$73.17 a barrel. The contract hit US$71.18 on Tuesday, its lowest since Aug. 16. U.S. crude rose 68 cents to US$62.89.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While Iranian oil exports are expected to fall because of U.S. sanctions that took effect on Monday, reports from <span class="companylink">OPEC</span> and other forecasters have indicated that the global market could see a 2019 supply surplus as demand slows.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Gold rose on Wednesday as U.S. midterm elections delivered a split Congress and pressured the dollar, with investors now turning their attention to the <span class="companylink">U.S. Federal Reserve</span> meeting for clues on future interest rate hikes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Spot gold was up 0.6 per cent to US$1,233.88 per ounce, while U.S. gold futures climbed 0.7 per cent to US$1,235.40 per ounce.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Weaker crude oil prices have kept USD/CAD above $1.3100 (76.33 cents US) as the market digests the results of the US mid-term elections. Prices will have to pierce support at $1.3080 (76.45 cents US) in order to nullify the current uptrend, with $1.3170 (75.93 cents US) serving as resistance,” said a note from <span class="companylink">RBC Capital Markets</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The U.S. dollar’s losses accelerated on Wednesday with an index falling half a per cent against its main rivals as the outcome of a split <span class="companylink">U.S. Congress</span> raised expectations that any major U.S. fiscal policy boost to the economy is unlikely for now.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The greenback has been the surprise winner in the global currency markets this year on the back of President Donald Trump’s fiscal stimulus and strong economic data which has forced the <span class="companylink">U.S. Federal Reserve</span> to signal higher interest rates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But market watchers believe the outcome of the U.S. midterm, with Democrats taking the House and Republicans keeping control of the Senate, makes any further U.S. policy boost difficult. Trump’s policies may also come under greater scrutiny, fueling fresh political uncertainty.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prospects of less fiscal stimulus would also relieve the pressure on the Fed to keep raising interest rates and add downward pressure on <span class="companylink">U.S. Treasury</span> yields and the dollar. Yields on U.S. debt were down 3 to 5 basis points across the board.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Swap markets currently expect about 65 basis points in cumulative rate hikes until September 2019, though traders say that might fall further if bond yields extend their decline.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“There is a growing assumption that the room for another dose of stimulus for the Trump administration is going to be very limited and that is pushing the dollar lower,” said Piotr Matys, an FX strategist at <span class="companylink">Rabobank</span> in London.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Against a basket of its rivals , the dollar sank 0.5 per cent to 95.758, its lowest level in more than two weeks.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CALGARY—City officials say they don't have an easy answer for how to address plummeting downtown office building values that have left a lingering property tax gap that isn't going away and could see other Calgary businesses picking up at least part of the tab.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">City manager Jeff Fielding said Tuesday that the past three years have seen more than $12.5 billion in lost property value from highly valued downtown office space, amounting to a $192-million tax burden that has to be shared between 13,815 commercial properties in Calgary.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“This is our hot potato. I've never seen anything like it,” Fielding said. “It's unique to Calgary.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2017 and 2018, the city pulled a total of nearly $90 million from its fiscal reserve fund in an effort to cap non-residential property tax increases at 5 per cent. Mayor Naheed Nenshi said it's unlikely that the city will be able to shield businesses in the same way in the coming year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">City council saw a presentation about the issue during an all-day closed session on Oct. 11. After the vote to keep the material confidential failed on a 7-7 tie, it was referred to the priorities and finance committee, where the public presentation was subsequently postponed twice due to last week's Olympics discussion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At Tuesday's committee meeting, councillors recommended the creation of two task forces to present a report on the non-residential tax issue in early 2019.</p>

Calgary needs structural fix to tax burden shift from downtown: Nenshi[https://www.thestar.com/calgary/2018/10/30/calgary-needs-structural-fix-to-tax-burden-shift-from-downtown-nenshi.html]
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But after collapsing oil prices in 2014 led to the gutting of Calgary's office towers, there isn't a clear way forward for Calgary as Alberta's economy continues to recover.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Downtown office vacancy rates are still high at around 30 per cent, and Calgary's unemployment rate remains at 8.2 per cent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The current situation means that if a building's value increased by 10 per cent last year, Fielding explained, they could be looking at an estimated tax increase of up to 28.7 per cent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I'm telling you, I don't know what to do here,” Fielding said. “This is one of the interesting things about this problem: people are saying, 'You had this problem for two years. Why the hell aren't you doing anything with it?'</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“It's a very simple problem and it's very specific to a select number of buildings and it's going to persist for a while.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fielding said that because the problem is so specific to highly valued buildings downtown, the fix isn't found in single broad measures like increasing residential property taxes or cutting the city's budget.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Potential options, he said, include reviewing the city's non-residential property tax classes, implementing a 2019 non-residential tax relief program and allowing the market to settle into what may be its “new norm.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Incrementally, we can make a difference, but I can't solve this problem that happened over one year,” Fielding said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ward 8 Councillor Evan Woolley said he was frustrated to see a lack of concrete options to find a way forward.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“That's what everyone keeps saying is there's no magic bullet, but what we're hoping for is a whole bunch of little things we can do.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After the meeting, he said telling business owners who are struggling that this is “just part of the system” is “unacceptable.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We expected to see the bottom of this, and we're not. We're supporting the small business community through savings ... There's other ways we need to support that.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nenshi said the issue is a serious problem for the city, but he cautioned against being “overly dramatic” about it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Ultimately, the solution to this is filling up the downtown at good lease rates, but we've got to figure out what to do while we're getting there,” he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Ward 9 Councillor Gian-Carlo Carra called the issue a “crisis,” and Ward 7 Councillor Druh Farrell said it was “the most serious issue council has faced in my career” apart from the 2013 flood.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nenshi said the solution will likely involve a mix of one-time money, tax changes and sorting out a long-term solution. But the mayor added that transferring all of the tax burden to residential properties in “one fell swoop” ultimately won't work.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We've got to make sure that we're providing the services people want while at the same time ensuring the tax burden doesn't shift and get very expensive for everyone. It's not easy, but the good news is we're having this conversation, we're having it in public and we are very open to ideas as well,” he said.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The NDP and the United Conservative Party made the statements as they teamed up to shut down an emergency debate on the issue, proposed by Liberal MLA David Swann. The oil industry could face an estimated $260 billion in financial liabilities, a joint investigation by National Observer, Global News, the Toronto Star and StarMetro Calgary revealed last week — a price tag Swann said could be a “silent financial tsunami.”</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“This is a huge liability for our environment, for our provincial budget, for the oil and gas industry and for future generations,” said Alberta Liberal Party Leader David Khan, who doesn't have a seat in the legislature.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“It's really concerning that the government which controls the legislative agenda is not willing to effectively address this, and the official Opposition is not ... holding the government to account on a such a critical issue.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last Thursday, the Alberta Energy Regulator (AER) apologized [https://www.thestar.com/calgary/2018/11/01/alberta-regulator-apologizes-for-spooking-public-with-260-billion-cleanup-cost-estimate.html]for a “staggering” presentation, made last February by one of its highest-ranking officials, which warned the province's energy sector about the $260-billion estimate. That calculation is more than $200 billion greater than the previous calculation made public by the regulator — $58.65 billion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The liability estimate factors in the costs of shutting down and cleaning up oil-and-gas sites at the end of their usefulness. That includes inactive wells, pipelines and tailings ponds in the oilsands.</p>

</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The details of the presentation were made public by the joint investigation Thursday. In response, the AER said the number in the presentation was based on a “worst-case scenario” of a complete industry shutdown, and using it was an “error in judgment and one we deeply regret.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It also said the higher estimate had “not been validated by AER.” That appeared to contradict the presentation, which said the $260-billion figure was likely to be a low estimate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Friday, AER CEO and president Jim Ellis announced his resignation[https://www.thestar.com/calgary/2018/11/02/head-of-alberta-energy-regulator-resigns.html] — a move the regulator said was “unrelated” to the joint investigation's findings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The issue was raised during question period in the House of Commons last week as federal politicians sparred over the joint investigation's findings. However, Swann's remarks Tuesday were the first time an MLA has raised the figure in the Alberta legislature.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Any MLA can ask to hold an emergency debate in the legislature. But before that happens, the Speaker must allow MLAs to debate whether the issue qualifies, then decide if the assembly should vote to hold the debate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Swann argued that the price of cleaning up the energy sector is a pressing issue, calling it a financial and environmental crisis that could affect generations. So far, companies have only submitted about $1.6 billion in security deposits to cover the cost, he noted.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“If not now, when will we ... address this silent financial tsunami?” Swann said. “The time for denial and inaction is over.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">However, the NDP and UCP said the issue is significant but long-standing, and not acute enough for an emergency debate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“This government has in fact addressed it, which means it is not an (emergency),” said NDP MLA Richard Feehan, adding that the current government has started improving practices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I did not hear anything (in Swann's remarks) that would indicate the urgency that is required,” said UCP MLA Jason Nixon.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Speaker sided with Nixon and Feehan, deciding not to put the possibility of debate to a vote.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Khan said that, if left unaddressed, taxpayers could be left paying the $260-billion estimate — something that could triple Alberta's debt, which is forecast to reach $71.1 billion by 2019-20.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“It's a failure of leadership,” said Khan. “They just want to put their heads in the sand and not address the issue and kick the can down the road as other governments have done.”</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The province reported a $547-million deficit on Tuesday, compared to the $683-million deficit projected in last spring's budget.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The difference — $136 million — is "all oil," according to Finance Minister Tom Osborne, citing rising oil prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The last three years have been the most economically difficult in the province since the Great Depression, he said, but he was confident his financial plan will get the province back on track.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"While we have not yet turned the corner, it is clearly in sight," Osborne said after unveiling the fall fiscal update.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The government is adjusting the projected price of oil to US$74 per barrel, US$11 higher than the US$63 per barrel projected in the spring budget -- a number Osborne still considers "abundantly prudent."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The province announced its deepest-ever offshore oil site at Bay du Nord this summer, which Premier Dwight Ball called a "new frontier" for the industry.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Osborne suggested possible future projects in the offshore oil sector could yield more financial boosts down the road.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He was confident that Newfoundland and Labrador's relatively clean offshore oil will remain profitable compared to products from Alberta's oilsands.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And he touted plans to diversify the economy through different capital projects in the mining, aquaculture and tourism sectors so reliance on oil doesn't burn a hole in the government's pockets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NDP Leader Gerry Rogers said rising oil prices are giving the governing Liberals a boost, but there has been little progress in areas that affect residents' daily lives.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"They've been lucky in the right place at the right time," said Rogers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Osborne's fiscal update, the projected spending for the year remained on target at around $8.4-billion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The update noted that the province's net debt now sits at $15.4-billion, with a $157-million decrease from the 2018 budget.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The province's financial borrowing requirements are also down about $200 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Osborne pointed to the over-budget Muskrat Falls hydro megaproject as the province's largest economic liability -- responsible for more than 30 per cent of the province's direct debt, according to Osborne.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The minister blamed the project, now the subject of a public inquiry, as a burden left by the former Tory government.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He also pointed to the much-maligned 2016 tax plan by former finance minister Cathy Bennett as a difficult policy that helped put a dent in managing the province's debts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I didn't like what had to be done, but it had to be done to get us back on track," Osborne said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Richard Alexander of the Newfoundland and Labrador Employers Council said he is not confident the government will meet its promise of balancing the budget by 2022. The council released an opinion poll Tuesday suggesting only eight per cent of the population surveyed believes the government will meet the target.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I think people are very, very concerned about the debt burden that's happening in this province. Their plan is risky and relies very heavily on taxation, it relies on the increasing price of oil," Alexander said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We need some action to be able to ... provide that confidence to the public and to businesses that things are going to get better."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The rising tide of investor interest in green bonds – which has tripled since 2015 – and in clean finance more generally is indisputable. But if we are going to navigate our way to safer climate-change waters while continuing to grow our economy, we need to be sure that tide is indeed lifting all boats. In other words, we need mechanisms that finance climate-friendly projects, not only for solar panels and transit tracks, but also for a massive transition in carbon-intensive industries.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The federal government’s expert panel on sustainable finance shares that view, and in October endorsed “transition-linked financial products” to help channel green investment to high-emitting industries. It also called for standards regarding what the types of activities would quality for this kind of investment. Standards-based clarity in this area was also an important theme in a recent report on clean finance from Toronto Finance International. A “shared language” for green and sustainable finance across all industries is similarly a priority for the FC4S Network, a global platform of leading financial centres working on sustainability. <span class="companylink">Corporate Knights</span> – as with some 40 other organizations representing Canadian bond issuers, raters, underwriters and investors – has been working on such standards and shared language for several months to provide guidelines for industries and financial-services companies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The result is a set of just-released clean transition project[https://www.corporateknights.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Clean-Transition-Project-Categories-Draft.pdf] standards covering the oil-and-gas, mining and metals, heavy-industry and energy-utilities sectors. The standards are a crucial first step in establishing an important new type of green bond. “Clean-transition bonds” will help these vital sectors further reduce their emissions, while leveraging massive opportunities to improve processes and develop new products.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The draft guidelines define sector-specific activities that reduce carbon or otherwise improve environmental outcomes while often also establishing market advantage, and new products and revenue streams. For downstream oil-and-gas companies, for example, qualifying project categories include emissions-intensity reductions in refining, development of bio-based polymer products and renewable jet fuels, and provision of infrastructure for fuelling electric and hydrogen vehicles.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The standards then define the maximum percentage of proceeds from a clean-transition bond issue that can be directed to each activity, ranging from 25 per cent to 100 per cent, depending on the activity’s beneficial impact. In this way, the standards open the door to wider investor participation in decarbonization in these sectors, accompanied by assurance for investors that they are in fact financing climate-friendly projects that reduce climate-related risk.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Work remains to finalize the guidelines, and bond-market participants and heavy-industry finance officials will gather this month at a round table co-hosted by the federal expert panel and Toronto Finance International. Their goal will be to establish a made-in-Canada definition for how heavy industry can be part of the low-carbon transition. Ultimately, we hope the federal government will endorse the finalized standards, which are being crafted to integrate seamlessly with broader frameworks such as the green-bond principles established by the <span class="companylink">International Capital Market Association</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It’s worth noting too that, while Canada has depended on high-emitting economic sectors, the challenge of adapting clean finance for application within such contexts is global. By moving quickly to put standards in place here, Canada can become a leader in the burgeoning market for clean-finance expertise and mechanisms (itself a major growth opportunity for this country’s financial companies). At the same time, we will help facilitate a transition that will not only combat climate change, but also, we are convinced, lay the foundation for tremendous growth within core economic sectors. To test that belief – and concurrent with the development of the new investment guidelines – Corporate Knights recently drew on data from Alberta Innovates to quantify the market opportunities for non-combustion uses of bitumen from the Alberta oil sands. The outcome is tremendously heartening for anyone who fears a hollowing out of the economic opportunity currently derived from this resource. The most promising product types leverage the very attributes that give bitumen a heavy footprint when burned. They include use of carbon fibres for steel replacement and in concrete and wood composites, along with pelletized asphalt. The annual market value of just those four product lines could be US$218-billion by 2030. Add in a wider range of sustainable commodities that could be made from bitumen and other abundant raw materials and the analysis suggests a market opportunity of about US$1.5-trillion annually. Of course, none of that will happen without substantial investment – in fact, Corporate Knights estimates the cost to be at least US$1.8-trillion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More of that needs to come from the growing number of investors who are specifically looking for green assurances, and bypassing sectors such as oil and gas. Where clean finance is concerned, it is time to make room on board for a broader range of Canadian industries and to put the entire Canadian economy, and heavy industry around the world, on a surer course to clean growth.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and Alberta Premier Rachel Notley, they're the reason we bought a pipeline, and need to twin it and fill it with bitumen in a hurry. According to United Conservative Party leader Jason Kenney (and federal Conservative leader Andrew Scheer, and Ontario Premier Doug Ford) they're the reason we can't have a price on carbon.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Well, this past week those arguments exploded in a million oily droplets — though no one really noticed. That's because the headlines read[https://www.thestar.com/news/investigations/2018/11/01/what-would-it-cost-to-clean-up-albertas-oilpatch-260-billion-a-top-official-warns.html], “Cleaning up Alberta's oilpatch could cost $260 billion” instead of: cleaning up Alberta's oilpatch could spark a reclamation boom that would create decades of full employment in the province and beyond.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The bombshell figure of more than a quarter trillion dollars — revealed in dramatic fashion last week — is the Alberta Energy Regulator's (AER) behind-closed-doors estimate of the energy industry's environmental liabilities. Many times larger than what the AER has admitted publicly, it is a stunning, staggering sum.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is also an epic opportunity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If Alberta retooled its economic engine to restore the landscape of this beautiful province, rather than continuing to ravage it with extraction, riggers could keep right on rigging and truckers could keep on trucking. With comparatively little retraining or relocation, hundreds of thousands of oilfield service workers could keep doing what they do, where they do it — protected by the same unions too.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We don't need another pipeline or gargantuan bitumen mine to pump money into the coffers of multinational oil companies. On the contrary, the much greater economic opportunity lies in cleaning up the mess they have already profited from.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And all we need to spark this boom is for governments to enforce the law and make polluters pay. You see, in Canada, the oil industry has a legal obligation to return oil and gas sites to near their original state after their productive life ends.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now of course there are barriers, huge ones. First, cleanup money has not been set aside. Forty four years of petro-Conservativism resulted in only $1.6 billion in industry deposits against that vast slag heap of liabilities. That works out to just 0.6 cents of every dollar the AER predicts we'll need for the eventual cleanup.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And needless to say, while the Notley government has been utterly relentless in demanding a new pipeline, it just hasn't gotten around to pressuring industry to kick any more cash into the cleanup kitty.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even more significant, once the biggest industry players have extracted most of the value out of a well, mine, or pipeline, they generally sell it down the line to smaller players who try to squeeze the last profits out of the asset. These kinds of companies don't have $260 billion lying around the office.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But there are solutions. First, even in the mature and declining crude oil and gas industries there is plenty of money that will be generated from future production — in fact, the current regulatory system is premised on that revenue being used to cover the liabilities of the past.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The problem is that regulators have never had a mechanism to collect it. That's why the Western provinces need to establish Reclamation Trusts to identify insolvent producers, wind them down, and use the revenue from remaining production to fund the cleanup and put folks back to work.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Second, under a government serious about sparking the next boom in the oilpatch, the major industry players (who have extracted hundreds of billions in profits from Alberta) could and should foot a big part of the bill.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Whatever the mechanism, Alberta's reclamation renaissance would be a major part of the epochal climate transition Canada needs to embrace on an emergency basis. Just last month, the world's top climate scientists told governments we have 12 years to cut global emissions by 45 per cent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Otherwise, we're in for trillions of dollars in additional damages, more mass migration, poverty, and premature death — the whole disaster movie that heating the planet another half degree will bring.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So let's stop squabbling about unnecessary pipelines and insufficient prices on carbon. Instead, let's get moving on a national mission that could unleash a gusher of good jobs, in the service of healing the land and saving our future — rather than digging it up and burning it. We could start in Alberta.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If there ever was city with the DNA to take the bull by the horns and succeed, it's Calgary. Calgarians are passionate about their city and in having a voice in its future. As the city gets ready to vote in the Calgary 2026 plebiscite, the decision whether Calgary should bid to host the 2026 Winter Olympic and Paralympic Games continues to be hotly debated.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">Calgary Economic Development</span> is clear in its support of a responsible bid for the Games. The organization wants to rally Calgarians to vote yes for a bid that, it argues, provides value for taxpayers and the opportunity to propel the city's economy forward. The CED is enthusiastic about the 50-plus days celebrating sports and culture in 2026 - it certainly helps to stake Calgary's claim as the ultimate host city - but as an economic development agency, the CED is far more excited about what it believes will be more than a decade of opportunities for local businesses to benefit from the Games.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Calgarians know they don't control much in today's uncertain world. They're forced to take discount prices for oil and gas. They can't get a pipeline to tidewater and no one knows what is going to happen next with the country's next-door neighbour and biggest trading partner.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Canada is facing historic headwinds in many areas of the economy that we can't control. One thing Calgary can take into its own hands, as a city, is this bid for the Olympic and Paralympic Games. This is a take-it or leave-it opportunity to leverage other people's money - the <span class="companylink">Government of Canada</span>, the Government of Alberta, <span class="companylink">International Olympic Committee</span> and others - to create the city we want, says the CED.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Calgary has just introduced a new economic strategy to serve as a roadmap to the city that it wants to be not just in 2026, but in 2036 and 2046. It's rooted in the critical roles of four elements - people, place, innovation and business environment - for the city's enduring prosperity. We can champion accessibility, inclusion and innovation in these Games, says the CED.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hosting the Games, the CED argues, will accelerate implementing the new economic strategy. It gives Calgarians an opportunity to continue to be a city that leads the world and is vital to Canada. Hosting the Games is a chance to showcase the city globally, invite the best and brightest to our doorstep, and empower our companies to thrive in a world of opportunities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This isn't a simple calculation. The return on investment for Calgary to host a Games goes beyond the economic numbers, the CED says. If you think of what was done with the opportunity to boost Calgary in 1988, just imagine what could be done now.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Kayden Abel was four years old when he started playing soccer. Having just turned 25, the Edmonton resident has parlayed his technical skills into success as a freestyle pro and coach. He’s in demand for his specialized work, but, career-wise, he wanted to expand his options.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Abel knew he’d found what he was looking for when he discovered the Cannabis Education Program, which is offered exclusively online through the faculty of continuing education and extension at Mount Royal University in Calgary in partnership with the continuing and professional studies division of British Columbia’s Kwantlen Polytechnic University (KPU).</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Taught by horticulturalists, marketing specialists, and scientists working in the industry, the program checked all the boxes: It’s a field Mr. Abel is passionate about, and the online delivery allows him to learn and study at all hours of the day around his other commitments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I’ve been using medicinal cannabis for about six years, when I’m super sore after training,” Mr. Abel says. “When I heard it was becoming legal, I was wondering how I could get my foot in the door. I was looking online and this course popped up. I signed up right away.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“My schedule is pretty busy, and I coach a lot in the evenings, so this allows me to study on weekends or at 12 at night,” he adds. “The profs are super responsive.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For Mount Royal, the course is just one example of how educational institutions can leverage online programming to their competitive advantage. Whether it’s a new subject, a niche area, or a novel way of teaching a traditional topic, unique web-based programs are one way for colleges and universities across Canada to differentiate themselves. To that end, more and more institutions are becoming emboldened with their offerings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Brad Mahon, interim dean of continuing education at Mount Royal, says that the Cannabis Education Program, which launched earlier this year and is at full capacity with a total of 90 students, came about in large part because of the downturn in the Alberta economy. In the past, much of the department’s programming focused on corporate training for the oil and gas industry. As that sector has waned, so has demand for such classes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The role of continuing education is to evolve along with economic and societal shifts, Dr. Mahon says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We’re trying to reinvent ourselves,” Dr. Mahon says. “The economy is going to come back – these things are cyclic – but things are going to look different. We’re preparing for a new industry. That new industry needs a work force, and that’s where we come in.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I’m a big sports fan, and what makes great teams great is the ability to reorganize and adjust and move ahead,” he says. “That’s what we want to do. Continuing education is mandated to be responsive, flexible and nimble. We need to recognize that more and more, students are consumers of education.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More than ever before, those consumers have options when it comes to the type and breadth of education they want to pursue via online studies, learning on their own schedules, often in corners of the day between professional or family commitments, from the comfort of their own homes, usually at costs well below those of bricks-and-mortar universities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Athabasca University, for example, offers the world’s only MBA in hockey management as well as chemistry courses that include labs (complete with mail-safe chemicals, beakers and pipettes).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Laurentian University has a bachelor of forensic identification, a degree exclusively available to Canadian police officers who investigate crime scenes and the only program of its kind in North America. It also offers a fully online French bachelor degree of science in nursing for registered nurses as well as a bachelor degree in social work.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">University of Alberta</span> offers virtual courses such as Indigenous Canada, a “massive open online course” – meaning one aimed at unlimited participation and open access – geared to students outside of the faculty of native studies who are interested in aboriginal/non-aboriginal relationships. It also has Dino 101/Dinosaur Paleobiology, a 12-session overview of non-avian dinosaurs taught by professor and Canada Research Chair Philip John Currie. (With videos and readings, it’s taught in English but has French, Italian, German and Spanish subtitles.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Then there’s a bachelor degree program in architecture at the RAIC Centre for Architecture at Athabasca University. The partnership of the <span class="companylink">Royal Architectural Institute of Canada</span> and Athabasca University offers an alternative pathway to architectural licencing. When they’re not taking academic courses online, students work for licenced Canadian architects to log experience and take face-to-face design studios with the RAIC in major cities across Canada.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While the courses consist of videos, online quizzes, forums, interactive materials, and e-texts, the program’s virtual design studios are particularly innovative, explains Douglas MacLeod, chair of the RAIC Centre for Architecture. Using video and teleconferencing, students from across Canada (and sometimes around the world) meet with their instructors online on a weekly basis to share and discuss their designs. Students can share their screen and others can see and comment on the drawings or models that they’re developing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The program has other features, such as an online gallery of student work, an <span class="companylink">Instagram</span> account to share current news, free open educational resources in its publications section, and even a <span class="companylink">YouTube</span> channel for one of its courses. It provides online access to tools such as MatchBox Energy software, which allows students to predict how their designs will behave in terms of energy consumption.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Athabasca University provides an educational environment that is inclusive and accessible,” Dr. MacLeod says. “Many students cannot, for whatever reason, attend a traditional university full-time. By working and staying in their own communities, we help make education more affordable for students. Because of this, we feel that we are unlocking the architectural talent that is inherent in diverse communities across Canada and increasingly around the world. Traditional schools receive four or five applicants for every seat in their program. Our program is easily scalable to accommodate all those who want to, and are qualified to, study architecture.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Athabasca University now operates one of the largest undergraduate programs in architectural education in Canada, with course registrations from more than 660 students in the past 12 months and having had students from 16 countries.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“What we are seeing is that many students from other faculties are taking architecture courses with us because of their general interest in the field,” Dr. MacLeod says. “This is good for both students and the profession. Courses at traditional schools of architecture are generally not open to non-program students. Ours are."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Heidi Erisman, executive director CVU-UVC, a consortium of nine universities that collaborate to promote online learning, says flexibility is the main driver of the success and popularity of online learning. So is the societal shift to online everything.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“When online learning really started taking off, it was mostly baby boomers,” Ms. Erisman says. “Now we are seeing a big uptake with younger people. Because their lives are increasingly online, it makes absolute sense that they would study online.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“It’s a business proposition for institutions as well,” she says. “Online pedagogy is really helpful for learners because it’s systematic. Online curriculum is very disciplined and is structured in such a way that people retain the learning.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At <span class="companylink">Carleton University</span> in Ottawa, digital archeologist Shawn Graham offers an online course called Crafting Digital History, which enables students to undertake comprehensive historical research using powerful digital tools. Last year, his students processed and analyzed the entire print run of the Shawville Equity, a newspaper in Quebec that has been publishing since the 1880s.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The course is designed via progressive modules to replicate the stages of real digital research in history,” Dr. Graham says. “Digital historians put their work out there, they talk with each other in open venues, they ask for help, and they’re open about things that didn’t work. The course initiates students into this community of practice, this community of scholarship. ... A field that has online work as part of the core of its practice needs to be taught in that same environment, and it must engage with others working in that space.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Carleton, meanwhile, also offers open-access introductory psychology classes online for free. Instead of a typical face-to-face class consisting of three-hour lectures over 12 weeks, professor Bruce H. Tsuji has converted courses for online learning into close to 70 video modules averaging 10 minutes each (“the ‘sweet spot’ of the human attention span,” he says). Students can progress as slowly or as quickly as they want.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“These short modules mean that students can squeeze them in while waiting for their coffee or riding the bus,” Dr. Tsuji says. “My video modules are close-captioned. This is great for those with some kinds of learning disabilities or those for whom English is not their first language. Video modules can also be replayed, sped up, or slowed down. Most students in face-to-face classes are too shy to say, ‘Can you please repeat that?’ to their professors.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Students find them more convenient than commuting to the university, finding a parking spot, and getting to a classroom at 8:30 on Monday morning or 3:30 on Friday afternoon,” he adds. “An unfortunate reality is that many university classrooms may be smelly, dirty, too hot or too cold, and crowded.”</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">OTTAWA — Canada's spy agency says many members of the environmental and Indigenous communities see the federal purchase of the Trans Mountain pipeline as a betrayal, and suggests that could intensify opposition to expanding the project.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A <span class="companylink">Canadian Security Intelligence Service</span> assessment highlights a renewed sense of indignation among protesters and clearly indicates the spy service's ongoing interest in anti-petroleum activism.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Canadian Press used the Access to Information Act to obtain a heavily censored copy of the June CSIS brief, originally classified top secret.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Civil liberties and environmental activists questioned the rationale for CSIS's interest, given that opposition to the pipeline project has been peaceful.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CSIS spokeswoman Tahera Mufti stressed the spy service is committed to following the governing legislation that forbids it to probe lawful protest and dissent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"While we cannot publicly disclose our investigative interests, we can say that it is important for the service to pose important analytical questions on these types of issues, such as the question of whether developments such as the purchase of a pipeline could give rise to a national-security threat to Canada's critical infrastructure."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Earlier this year, <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span> dropped plans to twin an existing pipeline that carries about 300,000 barrels of bitumen daily from Alberta to British Columbia. The federal government announced in late May it would buy the pipeline and related components for $4.5 billion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The government intends to finance and manage construction of the second pipeline — which would increase the overall flow of bitumen to 890,000 barrels a day — and ultimately try to find a buyer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The CSIS brief characterizes resistance to the pipeline project as a "developing intelligence issue."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Indigenous and non-Indigenous opponents of the project continue to highlight the increasing threats to the planet as a result of climate change and the incompatibility of new pipeline and oil sands projects with Canada's 2015 commitment under the Paris Climate Accord," the brief says. "At the same time, many within the broader Indigenous community view the federal government's purchase and possible financing, construction and operation of an expanded bitumen pipeline as wholly incompatible with its attempts at Crown-Indigenous reconciliation."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The pipeline acquisition and commitment to complete the project is therefore "viewed as a betrayal" by many within both the environmental and Indigenous communities, CSIS says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Indigenous opposition at the grassroots level remains strong. In response to the federal purchase, numerous Indigenous and environmental organizations have restated their commitment to prevent construction."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The brief singles out the Treaty Alliance Against Tar Sands Expansion, noting it has signatories from over 50 North American First Nations in its bid to halt the project. It also features a May quote from Canadian environmental organization Stand.earth that the decision "will haunt the Trudeau government."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The intelligence brief was completed a little more than two months before the Federal Court of Appeal quashed government approval of the pipeline project due to inadequate consultation with Indigenous groups and failure to properly assess the effect of increased tanker traffic in the waters off British Columbia.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the wake of the court ruling, the federal government ordered the <span class="companylink">National Energy Board</span> to reassess the tanker issue and asked a former Supreme Court justice to oversee fresh consultations with Indigenous communities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The CSIS brief notes there had been "no acts of serious violence" stemming from peaceful demonstrations and blockades at Trans Mountain facilities in British Columbia that resulted in the arrest of more than 200 people, or at smaller protests across the country.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">However, the document includes a section titled "Violent Confrontations and Resource Development" that mentions past conflicts over shale-gas development in New Brunswick and a high-profile pipeline in North Dakota.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is unclear, because of the redactions to the document, exactly what CSIS was looking at, said Josh Paterson, executive director of the British Columbia Civil Liberties Association, which has expressed strong concern about the spy service's monitoring of activists.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the information that has been released, there is no suggestion of a threat to national security or critical infrastructure, of clandestine activities or of violence in relation to the Trans Mountain project, Paterson said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"While some opponents of the pipeline were arrested during protest for breaching a court order, that was a matter for police and the courts, and was done out in the open — it should not be a matter for our spy agency."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Given past interest on the part of security and police officials, the CSIS brief is not surprising, said Tegan Hansen, a spokeswoman for Protect the Inlet, an Indigenous-led effort against the pipeline and tanker project.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But she is curious as to why the spy service document makes reference to sabotage and violent physical confrontations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I'm not sure why they're trying to draw that connection with violence," Hansen said. "I'd be interested to know. But it's certainly not our intention to ever pursue violence."</p>

<span class="companylink">Encana</span>'s announcement last week that it was acquiring Texasbased Newfield Exploration may be good news for the Calgary-based company, but it is not good news for Canada. It is the most recent chapter in an unfolding story of capital flight from the Canadian energy sector. First the big internationals, and now Canadian-based firms like <span class="companylink">Encana</span>, are moving their operations and/or capital budgets out of Canada and relocating their money to the U.S. and elsewhere. And it's no mystery why. Thanks to government policies adopted by the governments of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and Alberta premier Rachel Notley since their respective elections in 2015, Canada has become a less and less competitive place to invest and do business.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">Encana</span>'s $7.7-billion deal for Newfield's oil assets is its most recent U.S. acquisition. <span class="companylink">Encana</span> had already made significant new investments in the U.S. in the Permian and Eagle Ford fields over the past three years. This spring Encana CEO Doug Suttles moved to the company's Denver office, sparking fears that <span class="companylink">Encana</span>'s head office - with its 1,000 employees in Calgary - may soon move with him. <span class="companylink">Encana</span> insists that this will not happen. We'll see. Half its board of directors are now U.S.-based, and with the Newfield acquisition, 60 per cent of <span class="companylink">Encana</span>'s production is now in the U.S.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">Encana</span> is only the latest example of the exodus of capital since 2015. Initially it was primarily large international companies. In 2016-17, seven international energy companies, including Statoil (Norway), Total (France), <span class="companylink">Shell</span> (Netherlands-U.K.), <span class="companylink">Conoco Phillips</span> (U.S.) and Marathon (U.S.), dumped all or most of their Western Canadian assets - over $37 billion in sales.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More recently, it has been Canadian energy companies shifting their focus and their capital to the tax-and-regulation friendlier U.S. Encana has led the way, but the list of followers is growing. Enerplus has made significant investments in the Bakken and the Marcellus plays, and most recently in the Denver basin. Crescent Point is now spending more on its Uintah and Bakken properties than in Canada, and Baytex is doing the same in the Eagle Ford in Texas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Predictably, Canadian energy-service companies are following the money to the U.S. With its acquisition of <span class="companylink">Trinidad Drilling</span>, Calgarybased Precision Drilling now has more rigs in the U.S. than in Canada. That has the oilpatch wondering whether Precision's CEO might also be considering moving himself to Houston. This past January, Calgary's <span class="companylink">Akita Drilling</span> explained the benefits of its $209-million merger with U.S.-focused Xtreme Drilling as providing "immediate scale in the US market, building upon (Akita's) recent strategic expansion into the Permian." Last year, <span class="companylink">Total Energy Services</span> acquired <span class="companylink">Savanna Energy Services</span> to give it more exposure to U.S. and Australian markets. Other Calgary-based service companies that are expanding their U.S. investments include Calfrac, Ensign Energy, Ideal and Phoenix.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After being burned by their respective pipeline proposals for Northern Gateway and Energy East, Enbridge and <span class="companylink">TransCanada</span> have also headed south with major new acquisitions. In 2016, Enbridge paid US$28 billion to buy Houston-based <span class="companylink">Spectra Energy Corp</span>. This acquisition makes Enbridge the owner of the largest network of oil and natural gas pipelines in the United States.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The same year, <span class="companylink">TransCanada</span> paid US$10.2 billion to acquire Houston-based <span class="companylink">Columbia Pipeline Group</span>. <span class="companylink">TransCanada</span> is also seeking trademarks on new company names that would excise the word "Canada" from its name. It has sought trademarks on the names TC Energy, TCE, Ventiv, Convergent and Northbow, sparking concerns that it too may be considering moving its head office to Texas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even Canadian pension plans have begun investing in U.S. energy assets. In 2017, the <span class="companylink">Canada Pension Plan Investment Board</span> announced that it would invest up to $1 billion to buy oil and gas assets in the United States in a partnership with Encino Energy Ltd. The <span class="companylink">Ontario Teachers'Pension Plan</span> is using its own subsidiary, Heritage Royalty, to acquire significant holdings in the Marcellus field in Pennsylvania.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So when will this exodus of capital stop? It won't, until policy-makers in Edmonton and Ottawa realize the costly consequences of their post-2015 policies and correct them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Canada's export pipeline fiascos - first Northern Gateway, then Energy East and now Trans Mountain - are the direct cause of the current, record-breaking fiftydollar discount on Canadian oil shipped to the U.S. Until a new export pipeline to a coastal port is built and operating, neither American nor Canadian companies will have much interest in investing in new Canadian production.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">First and foremost, this means that the Trans Mountain expansion to Vancouver - and new Asian markets - must be completed. When will that be? No time soon, and certainly not before the next federal election. The Liberal government's passive response to this summer's court decision halting Trans Mountain's expansion is purely political. It is designed not to alienate the climate-change voters who helped the Liberals win swing ridings in B.C. and Ontario in 2015.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Beyond that, the prospects are not much brighter. Does Bill C-69, the Liberals'proposed Impact Assessment Act meant to replace the current project-review regime, address the causes that derailed Northern Gateway, Energy East and Trans Mountain? There is an overwhelming consensus that it does not. It expands the number and kinds of policy requirements that must be satisfied, such as upstream and downstream emissions. It does nothing to clarify or formalize what concrete steps must be taken to satisfy the judicially-created test of Aboriginal consultation. And it opens the door to even more advocacy group interveners, whose goal is not better, safer pipelines but no pipelines. As currently written, Bill C-69 does nothing to improve the predictability, certainty and timeliness that any future investors would require.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But getting new pipelines built will not by itself solve Canada's competitiveness issues. The renewal of <span class="companylink">NAFTA</span> - the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement - is widely and rightly seen as positive for Canada. But these benefits come with certain costs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With freer trade, the U.S. has become not just our largest export market, but also our primary competitor for capital investment. As border restrictions thin, U.S. companies can invest in Canada, but Canadian companies can also choose to invest in the U.S. And capital goes where it gets the best return.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This means that Canadian governments - both federal and provincial - no longer have the kind of policy freedom that they once enjoyed. Changes with respect to corporate taxes, personal income taxes and capital-depreciation allowances all have consequences for our larger economy. The same is true of a whole host of regulatory policies, from environmental to labour, that impose timeconsuming obligations, and thus new costs, on Canadian businesses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since 2015 both the federal and Alberta governments have raised corporate and personal income taxes and phased out favourable tax deductions. The negative impact of these changes on our competitiveness has been aggravated by the reduction of similar taxes in the U.S. under a Republican president.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the real kicker has been the climate change policies adopted by both Ottawa and Alberta since 2015. These include not just the carbon tax, but also new methane emissions regulations, the 100-megatonne hard cap on oil sands emissions and the phasing out of coal-fired electricity and its replacement by more expensive wind and other renewables. The cumulative effect of these policies makes it more expensive to do business in Canada, especially for "energy intensive, trade-exposed" companies (EITE).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Not surprisingly, Canadian oil and gas is the highest EITE sector in Canada. It takes a lot of energy to produce oil and gas and therefore more CO2 emissions. About 78 per cent of what we produce is exported, and 99 per cent of these exports are sold to the U.S. at prices set by international markets. This means that carbon taxes and other climate-change-related costs cannot be passed on to American purchasers. They are taken out of Canadian producers'bottom lines. This explains the growing exodus of Canadian capital and energy companies to the U.S.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The unpleasant but inescapable fact is this: Canadian carbon-reduction policies must be more or less in line with what the Americans are doing. If we impose higher carbon penalties than the Americans do, investment capital will simply go south. This is what economists call "carbon leakage." It not only scares away capital investment and jobs to lower-cost jurisdictions but also achieves no net reduction in carbon emissions. The emissions just follow the money and enter the atmosphere from the other side of the border. It's a lose-lose option, and it's where we are right now.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Natural Resources Minister Amarjeet Sohi has personally met with leaders of nearly two dozen Indigenous communities since the Federal Court of Appeal struck down the <span class="companylink">Canadian government</span>'s approval of the Trans Mountain pipeline expansion in August.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The court said the original consultations with Indigenous communities affected by the pipeline plans was insufficient so the government is planning another attempt. Sohi already has met with people from 22 communities, including most of those behind the successful court challenge, as he tries to set rules for a new round that he hopes will satisfy the court's conditions.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sohi says this new round of talks has no deadlines and will follow the court's blueprint.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I take this very, very seriously," Sohi said Monday, a few days after his latest trip to meet with communities in British Columbia. "We need to do things differently."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In rejecting the government's approval of the pipeline plan at the end of the summer, the court said the consultation plan was sound but wasn't properly executed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The panel sent to meet with people affected by the pipeline was given no mandate to do anything with what it heard. The bureaucrats took notes but provided little in the way of feedback or answers to questions raised by different band councils. In many cases the communities were told their concerns could be dealt with after the pipeline was built but got no guarantee they actually would be.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sohi said this time the government has a mandate to adjust the project to deal with communities'concerns where possible. Where it's not possible, the government will explain in detail why. A band councillor from one of the communities in the court challenge that halted Trans Mountain's expansion is not buying that the government is sincere.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We're definitely not seeing a change in behaviour," said Khelsilem, a band councillor at Squamish Nation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">(He uses one name.) Squamish's territory sits partially on Burrard Inlet, the coastal fiord in the Vancouver metro area that is home to the Westridge Marine Terminal - the end of the pipeline. About five oil tankers a month leave the terminal loaded with both crude and refined oil products destined largely for the United States. An expanded Trans Mountain pipeline would triple the amount of oil flowing to the terminal and the number of tankers would jump to 34 a month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Khelsilem said his community had neither the time nor funding needed to do a proper assessment of the pipeline or its impacts the first time, and says nothing has changed about that.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sohi insists the government is not proceeding on the assumption cabinet will approve the pipeline a second time. But the Liberals just spent $4.5 billion to buy the existing pipeline from <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan Canada</span> in a bid to ensure the construction goes ahead.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span> got cold feet last winter after the British Columbia government threatened to regulate how much Alberta bitumen could flow through an expanded pipeline and went to court to determine if it had the legal authority to do so. The <span class="companylink">Canadian government</span> tried to broker a deal but at the end of May announced it would just buy the existing pipeline and the work already done on the expansion, build the new one, and then sell it back to the private sector when time and economics warranted it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is on record saying multiple times that the pipeline is going to be built.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Khelsilem said having a minister saying he's keeping an open mind - while the prime minister insists the pipeline will be built - is contradictory. He said he can't say if Squamish would ever sign off on the project, but that at the very least the community wants the time and funding needed to do its own assessment and set its own conditions on the construction.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Industry groups are warning Ottawa against introducing certain exemptions on a project list set to be released under Bill C-69 this fall, saying such a move would politicize decisions over which oil and gas projects will be subject to new federal regulations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The warnings come in response to a proposal by Ottawa to force some oilsands projects to face stricter federal environmental reviews if Alberta scraps its hard cap on oilsands emissions, now set at 100 million tonnes per year. The move was widely viewed as a political snare for United Conservative Party leader Jason Kenney, who has threatened to axe some of Alberta's climate policies if he wins the upcoming provincial election.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The decision by Ottawa would put so-called "in situ" oilsands developments on a list of projects that specifies what kind of industrial activity will be subject to tough new federal environmental assessments. Under current legislation, in situ projects, which use steam to loosen up bitumen reservoirs deep below the earth's surface, are only subject to provincial reviews.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Tim McMillan, CEO of the Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers, said Ottawa is "holding the hammer over industry" with its project list, and has long called for in situ developments to fall under provincial jurisdiction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"If you have a good rationale, let's talk about it," Mc-Millan said. "But if you're going to put on the list only to exempt it off, even though you have no rationale, that just doesn't make sense."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">His comments add to growing concerns over Bill C-69, a sprawling piece of legislation that will substantially broaden the scope of environmental reviews for major projects such as pipelines, hydro dams and offshore oil wells. Lobby groups have been putting pressure on Ottawa as it prepares to release its project list this fall, calling for relief on certain pipeline expansions, in situ projects and offshore programs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Earlier this year, <span class="companylink">Environment and Climate Change Canada</span> released a discussion paper that laid out guidelines for what projects might be subjected to environmental assessments under C-69. It said in situ oilsands facilities "could be" added to the project list, but said they could also be "exempted from federal assessment if a jurisdiction has in place a hard cap on greenhouse gas emissions." Alberta is the only province with a hard cap on oil-related GHG emissions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A spokesperson for Environment Minister Catherine McKenna declined to specify when the project list would be released. She said in situ projects could be subject to review under those environmental conditions because GHG emissions are "shared jurisdiction," and therefore require some level of climate policy to be in place. "We are working to depoliticize the process - criteria for major projects have been made public, with decisionmaking based on science and evidence," Environment spokesperson Caroline Thériault said in a statement.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CAPP has also called on Ottawa to remove offshore exploration drilling programs from the project list. Such drilling programs may take just three to six months to complete, the group said, but take years to secure regulatory approvals.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, the Canadian Energy Pipelines Association has asked for a sizable extension to its thresholds for pipeline projects that are subject to federal review. Currently, any pipeline that crosses provincial borders and is longer than 40 kilometres is subject to a federal assessment; CEPA has asked that threshold to be expanded to 500 kilometres.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"This impact assessment review should only be for those major, nation-building infrastructure projects," said Chris Bloomer, head of the CEPA.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Such concessions could go a long way in quieting industry criticism of C-69, which has been widespread ever since <span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan Canada</span>'s Trans Mountain pipeline was quashed by a Federal Court of Appeal ruling in August.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bloomer has been among the fiercest critics of the legislation, telling a House committee this year that it was "difficult to imagine that a new major pipeline could be built in Canada" under the looming C-69 changes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last month, Alberta Environment Minister Shannon Phillips called on Ottawa to "stop dithering" and release the project list.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Alberta, as well as several industry lobby groups, have said Bill C-69 creates unnecessary regulatory overlap between the provinces and federal government. The bill's opponents say many regulatory decisions are best left to provincial bodies like the Alberta Energy Regulator or the Canada-Newfoundland and Labrador Offshore Petroleum Board.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Environmental groups have called on Ottawa to include in situ projects on the list, saying to do otherwise would mark a contradiction in the Liberals'environmentally-minded climate policies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"That's like saying you're going to study the environmental impact of road vehicles and then giving a free pass to SUVs and transport trucks - it doesn't make any sense," said Patrick DeRochie at Environmental Defence.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The in situ process involves injecting steam through well bores as a way to tap deeper bitumen seams. Because most nearsurface oil deposits have been tapped in northern Alberta, analysts expect that as much as 80 per cent of future oilsands growth will come through in situ methods.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Really, the future of oilsands expansion, if there's going to be any expansion, is in situ oil production," DeRochie said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bill C-69 is currently in second reading in the Senate. A committee is expected to study the bill this winter.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CALGARY—Several Calgary non-profits brought their voices together this week to call for social assistance reform from the province, arguing that a long-standing lack of funding is failing vulnerable Albertans.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Monday morning, these groups met at the Women's Centre of Calgary to talk publicly about their call to the provincial government to raise funding for income supports and Alberta's Assured Income for the Severely Handicapped (AISH). The call for reform included a request to index these funds to tie them to consumer inflation, beginning next spring.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nevena Ivanovic, the Women's Centre of Calgary's public policy co-ordinator, said the base annual income support benefit for a single recipient who's deemed able to work was just under $8,000 in 2016, while those who have barriers to work received a base benefit of just under $10,000. As these amounts aren't tied to inflation, they've stayed consistent, having not risen since 2012.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Forget about adding food or clothing or transportation into this equation. Social assistance alone can't even cover basic rental at a market price in Calgary,” Ivanovic said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Right now, we're just looking at the inadequacy of these rates. Just the idea that someone gets $8,000 a year to live on, there's no dignity in that. There's just no dignity in deciding whether you should buy groceries or pay your rent, and we should believe that in our province we should be able to help everyone meet their most basic needs.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Monday's press conference stemmed from a letter addressed to Alberta's Minister of Community and Social Services Irfan Sabir calling for this reform. The letter was signed by more than 15 non-profits, including the women's centre, Vibrant Communities Calgary, the Calgary Counselling Centre and YWCA Calgary.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In response, Sabir said the provincial government has maintained stable and predictable funding for social assistance benefits since they were elected in 2015. But Sabir said the government is listening to public concerns about improving rates to account for inflation, and is actively looking into addressing the issue.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“When we became government, at that point we got an economy which was not in good shape. Oil prices were going down, oil revenues were not in good shape. At that point, the first priority was to maintain the stable funding for these programs,” Sabir said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We have provided funding to these programs, but this one is a different discussion (since) it's about rates and inflation.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The participating non-profits called for higher income support benefits to help the community as a whole — with better health outcomes, less strain on health-care services and greater food security.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Susan Gwynn, a member of the Poverty Talks! Advisory Committee, is a community member who herself has lived experience on income support. Gwynn, who has episodic ataxia, a genetic condition that prevents her from working, has been using AISH for more than five years to support her family, including three children.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Poverty Talks! is a committee made up of community members who have lived in poverty, and as part of this committee, Gwynn has advocated for increased funding for AISH. In her experience, Gwynn said she's only received $100 extra per month through using AISH to account for child care, and that raising kids on AISH has been almost impossible for her.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Gwynn said she wants to be able to raise her children to be active, participating members of the community, and a way to achieve this is to provide enough funding to families so parents can access community services and events themselves, and fully support their kids.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Improving one piece can improve the whole thing. The whole system can improve by improving one piece,” Gwynn said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Not to mention if you provide more funding, actual physical dollars, you can have an active community member, as opposed to someone who can't participate in the community because they don't have the financial resources.”</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Two of Canada’s largest investment banks say they don’t expect to meaningfully cut credit to the energy sector despite the widening gap between Canadian and U.S. benchmark oil.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Banks often use an energy company’s reserves as collateral for lending. Low oil prices reduce the value of those reserves, which can mean credit reductions for producers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Recently, oil sands producers in Western Canada have been forced to accept steep discounts for their crude as the lack of pipeline capacity and maintenance shutdowns at U.S. refineries have led to surpluses in Alberta.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Shane Fildes, the head of <span class="companylink">BMO</span>’s energy group, says he doesn’t expect to see dramatic reductions in credit stemming from the fall loan reviews.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That’s because the differential is expected to start narrowing again, and the bank uses future price projections – rather than the current spot price – in its credit calculations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“That sort of tension that’s going on, we think that’s going to get resolved,” Mr. Fildes said in an interview in Calgary, adding that there is a strong economic incentive to deal with the pipeline issues.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The refinery maintenance stuff is obviously temporary. The Enbridge Line 3 situation is looking good."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CIBC also said it doesn’t anticipate any material change in its support for Canada’s energy sector as a result of the review.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We are working closely with our clients to face the unique challenges and opportunities in Canadian energy,” a CIBC spokesperson said in an e-mail.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Raymond James analyst Jeremy McCrea said he doesn’t expect that banks will outright cut credit, particularly given that the differential is expected to improve by next April.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“You have a long history with the banks here in Canada supporting the [exploration and production] sector, and I think a lot of them don’t want to ruin relationships over these near-term blips in differentials,” Mr. McCrea said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“This is not the first time that we’ve seen these blips in differentials, and ultimately we find ways to resolve that."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But, he added, some banks may be encouraging their energy clients to reduce their capital spending plans for 2019 until economic conditions stabilize. That’s likely caused some producers to delay announcing their 2019 budgets, Mr. McCrea said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I think the banks are telling them to cut their CapEx budgets here. And the companies are saying ‘Well we don’t want to come out with this kind of a low CapEx budget.’ So that’s why they’re deferring it,” Mr. McCrea said.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ontario Premier Doug Ford has shuffled his cabinet[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/politics/article-ontario-premier-doug-ford-expected-to-shuffle-cabinet/] , following the sudden resignation of veteran cabinet minister Jim Wilson. He quit his post last Friday[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/canada/article-ontarios-minister-of-economic-development-quits-to-seek-addiction/] as economic development and trade minister, as well as the Progressive Conservative caucus, to seek treatment for addiction issues.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Today’s moves included a demotion for corrections minister Michael Tibollo, less than a week after The Globe and Mail reported that he, or the law firm he heads, faces five continuing lawsuits[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/canada/article-ontario-minister-michael-tibollo-faces-multiple-lawsuits/] . Mr. Tibollo becomes minister of tourism, culture and sport. Sylvia Jones leaves that post to become minister of community safety and correctional services.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">House Leader Todd Smith takes over Mr. Wilson’s post. Mr. Smith was also minister of government and consumer services, a job that will now go to government whip Bill Walker. John Yakabuski and Jeff Yurek are switching roles, with Mr. Yakabuski becoming minister of natural resources and forestry, and Mr. Yurek taking over the role of transportation minister.</p>

(for subscribers) The closings include 27 stores, two regional support centres and two plants as part of a plan to focus on the most profitable parts of its business.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The company currently has 68 <span class="companylink">Lowe’s</span> and 430 Rona stores in Canada.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Donald Trump’s name isn’t on the ballot, but the U.S. midterm elections tomorrow will certainly be a referendum on the President’s unconventional first two years in office, Tamsin McMahon writes in The Globe’s election guide[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/world/us-politics/article-2018-us-midterm-elections-explainer/] .</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some are predicting the results could split Congress, with the Democrats retaking the House of Representatives and the Republicans keeping control of the Senate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“There may never have been a set of midterm contests with so many vital themes, so many contradictory impulses, so many contrasting campaign memes and so many reasons to doubt any predictions – some for blue wave for the Democrats, others for a red-wave backlash for the Republicans – about how Tuesday’s 470 congressional races and 36 races for governors’ chairs will turn out,” David Shribman writes[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/world/us-politics/article-stakes-are-high-as-us-gallops-toward-midterm-elections/] .</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What John Ibbitson sees[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/world/article-the-democratic-demographic-advantage-is-real-and-growing/] is “signs that the coalition of Republican whites that elected Trump is crumbling. ... And while white voters in the past tended to swing as a block toward Republicans or Democrats, the increasingly overt nativism of the Republican Party is stoking divisions based on education and gender.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But a blue wave in midterms might not spell disaster for Mr. Trump, Niall Ferguson writes[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/opinion/article-a-blue-wave-in-midterms-might-not-spell-disaster-for-trump/] (for subscribers): “So you think President Trump is exceptionally unpopular?

Canada’s main stock index rose strongly today[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/investing/markets/inside-the-market/market-news/article-the-close-tsx-led-higher-by-gains-in-energy-marijuana-stocks/] , helped by a rebound in marijuana energy stocks, even though oil prices were mixed as new sanctions against Iran were imposed.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Wall Street stock indexes mostly rose on the eve of U.S. midterm elections to determine whether U.S. President Donald Trump’s Republican Party retains control of congress and also ahead of a meeting of <span class="companylink">Federal Reserve</span> policy makers.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NBC and Fox News Channel both said today that it will stop airing U.S. President Donald Trump’s campaign ad[https://www.facebook.com/theglobeandmail/posts/10156710171748904?__xts__[0]=68.ARAiiC8M8NiDvcbII2Qjf2CiOBaufSme4jX6xj65yFWRC_T4REWXjrAAwS3YS6QzELRiAQ6GU3NK53-X56ZvLpsqRQ17E9gGh8yGiYNQ9e4N71I-bIK8xJ1UTYN1K6Z03PKYBkFskx6LQRGLt3aHa-Uw9uf9NFIBKhICNKI8avmafPWJD0OvoreRaF1rROJvjJSyfbNAms32Jas8IZywhCYBmkIsxA&__tn__=-R] that featured an immigrant convicted of murder. <span class="companylink">CNN</span> had rejected the same ad, declaring it racist. <span class="companylink">Facebook</span> joined the fray, issuing this statement: “This ad violates <span class="companylink">Facebook</span>’s advertising policy against sensational content so we are rejecting it. While the video is allowed to be posted on <span class="companylink">Facebook</span>, it cannot receive paid distribution.” The ad includes footage of Luis Bracamontes, a twice-deported immigrant from Mexico sentenced to death in California for killing two police officers. Mr. Trump’s campaign manager, Brad Parscale, tweeted that NBC News, <span class="companylink">CNN</span> and <span class="companylink">Facebook</span> had chosen “to stand with those ILLEGALLY IN THIS COUNTRY” and that the media “are trying to control what you see and how you think.” He did not mention <span class="companylink">Fox</span>’s decision.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bureaucracy should not stand in the way of a dignified death</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Having checks and balances is good, but at a certain point, we have to respect a person’s choice without making them jump through another fiery hoop. Of course, anyone who requests [medical assistance in dying] should have the right to opt-out at any point, and about 5 per cent do. But progression of the illness itself should not strip people of their express wishes. When you have terminal cancer and make a reasoned decision to have hastened death, the cancer eating away at your brain should not be able to negate that decision.” -  André Picard [https://www.theglobeandmail.com/opinion/article-bureaucracy-should-not-stand-in-the-way-of-a-dignified-death/]
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The problem with #MeToo? The backlash</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The paradigm of skepticism must be flipped as a matter of fundamental human rights. This is what lies behind the hashtag #BelieveWomen: not throwing away due process, but defending it by challenging the deeply rooted bias that blames survivors, automatically disbelieves them and puts them on trial. If we want a legal system that seeks truth and justice, we must ensure that the rights of the accused – though indispensable – do not eclipse the rights of complainants. Sexual assault survivors need to know that their rights also matter in the justice system – that they matter.” -  Alana Prochuk and Kasari Govender [https://www.theglobeandmail.com/opinion/article-the-problem-with-metoo-the-backlash/] of West Coast LEAF, a women’s legal education and action fund</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Chris Bailey gets distracted a lot, and recently embarked on a project to get to the bottom of why this is – and what we can do about it. Here’s what he discovered[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/opinion/article-squirrel-we-must-zero-in-on-improving-our-attention-management/] along the way. Deliberately letting our mind wander is one of the best ways to become more creative. When our attention is at rest, we think about our goals 14 times as much as when we’re focused. We accomplish our intentions more often by taming distractions ahead of time: Use your phone’s greyscale mode, which turns your screen black-and-white and makes apps far less engaging; enable e-mail notifications for VIP contacts only; and have no-phone dinners with your family. Finally, the state of our attention determines the state of our lives. The moments in which we’re distracted accumulate to create a life that feels distracted and overwhelming.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Posed the old “What would you save from a burning house?” question, Orr has to think for a while and then pops out with, “My wife.” That one gets him laughing so hard that the cup of coffee he’s holding tips and a drop spills on his pant leg.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Lana Duke, 73, owns six Ruth’s Chris Steak House franchises, three in Ontario, including the most recent in Markham. Ms. Duke – creator of the slogan, “Come hungry, darlin,”– was the long-time adviser to the restaurant’s founder, the late Ruth Fertel. Globe subscribers, here’s how her story began[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/business/careers/management/article-steak-house-franchisee-lana-duke-on-making-six-figures-and-going-back/] :</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I was born in St. Catharines, Ont., went to a lot of foster homes; the first one’s foundation got me through adversity: talk about it, talk with someone you care about until you finally don’t want to talk about it any more.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At 18, I worked at a bank in Toronto, living with three girls. We wanted to travel, one wanted to be a stewardess. I said, “Where she gets based, we’ll start.” She got based in New Orleans. “Where is that?” The United States turned me down for a visa because of all the addresses I had, no parents or relatives. I asked for a meeting – essentially my first sale – pitching my lungs out that I wouldn’t be a problem. Two weeks later, I got a letter saying they’d let me in; went on March 9, 1963.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">People asked why I was there, they thought Canada was north of Alaska. I couldn’t get a job, sold pots and pans door-to-door, was a bowling alley cook, sold ads for a Catholic newspaper. I’m Protestant; the priest said I was making too much money.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">VANCOUVER — A conservation group is suing the British Columbia government for exempting two oilpatch dams from environmental rules years after the dams were built.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It seems like the government was really playing catch-up," Olivia French, the lawyer handling the lawsuit for the B.C. Sierra Club, said Monday.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Progress Energy acted with a bit of disregard for B.C.'s laws — one of those typical, 'Ask for forgiveness, not for permission' sort of positions," said French.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The lawsuit asks that the exemptions given the two dams be revoked.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">French said the issue is becoming too common in the province's northern natural gas fields.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A statement of defence has not yet been filed and none of the lawsuit's claims has been proven in court.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Progress Energy is an Alberta company owned by Malaysian oil giant Petronas. The dams were built in 2012 and 2014 to store water used by the company's fracking operations northwest of Fort St. John, B.C.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Petronas is the company planning to build a large liquid natural gas facility on the B.C. coast.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">B.C. Environment Minister George Heyman said legal officials are looking into the two dams.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“It’s very clear under the existing Environmental Assessment Act that proceeding with a project without undergoing an assessment is against the act," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Four months ago we referred the results of our investigation to Crown counsel and it’s now in their hands.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Both dams met legal criteria to undergo environmental assessments, French said. Provincial law dictates that proposed dams higher than 15 metres must be considered for review.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"All the parties agreed that these are technically reviewable projects," French said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">However, neither ever was, despite being well over the 15-metre benchmark.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The lawsuit alleges the province's environmental assessment office "received information" in 2016 that the Progress dams may be violating the rules. It says an inspector had a look and determined the company had broken the law by building them without getting an environmental permit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Neither the exemption requests nor the project descriptions for (the dams) provided any explanation from Progress Energy for the non-compliance with the (law)," the lawsuit says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2017, Progress Energy asked for the exemptions. The lawsuit cites internal communications which it says show the government was considering granting the exemptions even before the company asked.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Exemptions for both dams were granted in July.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">French said legislation doesn't allow the government to retroactively exempt companies from environmental reviews.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"They were not properly applying their own laws," she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The lawsuit also alleges the government made its decision based on limited information, none of which was provided to the public.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It just seems that these dams, which were built without licences and authorizations, should have been subject to a higher level of scrutiny," said French.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The B.C. government's response to this sets what may be a dangerous precedent, which may encourage other companies to follow in Progress Energy's footprints."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">French points to a 2017 study from the <span class="companylink">Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives</span>, which found 13 other Progress Energy dams were being retroactively reviewed by B.C.'s energy regulator. That report suggested there were "dozens" of other large, unlicensed dams operating in the province.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Records obtained by the (centre) indicate that the Oil and Gas Commission, Ministry of Forests, Lands and Natural Resource Operations and the BC Environmental Assessment Office are all aware of numerous unauthorized dams, and that they may contravene key provincial laws and regulations," the report says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">French said the lawsuit is partly intended to discourage similar situations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"(The centre) found there's a pattern of developers failing to follow the law, especially in northeastern B.C.," she said. "This is a concern."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Typically in the range of US$15 a barrel to reflect quality and transportation issues, the difference between Western Canada Select (WCS) – the benchmark for diluted bitumen – and North America’s widely quoted West Texas Intermediate (WTI) rose to more than US$50 earlier this fall. That differential was a steep US$45.32 a barrel during Thursday trading. With WTI’s retreat from its October highs, WCS – at US$18.19 a barrel – is now trading at lows not seen during the devastating international price collapse a few years ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The most-traded December futures contract for WTI settled at US$63.69 on Thursday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In an interview, Canadian Natural Resources president Tim McKay said he would not speculate how long the company would maintain the production cutback.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He said the prospects are good for a return to more normal markets by the end of 2019, with <span class="companylink">Enbridge Inc</span>.'s planned completion of a 350,000 b/d expansion of its Line 3 pipeline to the U.S. Midwest and an anticipated 250,000 b/d increase in crude-by-rail capacity. As well, the North West refinery outside of Edmonton – in which <span class="companylink">Canadian Natural Resources</span> is a half owner – is due to come on stream next year and will process 80,000 b/d of diluted bitumen into gasoline, diesel and other products.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We see [the discount] shrinking to become more normalized” by the latter part of 2019, Mr. McKay said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">Canadian Natural Resources</span> also blamed the steep price discount on the apportionment of pipeline space within Alberta when there is more supply than there is capacity on the system moving crude to markets in the United States. (Pipeline companies allocate space to companies on a complicated pro rata basis when there’s a shortage of capacity.) An industry committee tried to push through a reform to the apportionment system but it was narrowly defeated. Mr. McKay said the current system results in more supply being priced at a steeper spot-market discount than should be the case, and creates volatility in the WCS-WTI differential.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">Canadian Natural Resources</span> is not the only company that is responding in dramatic fashion to the widening price discounts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">MEG Energy Corp</span>. said on Thursday it will move up a planned maintenance that will remove up to 6,000 b/d of crude from the market, while <span class="companylink">Cenovus Energy Inc</span>. announced this week it is limiting output. Cenovus did not specify how much production it was restricting, but said it has slowed output at both its Foster Creek and Christina Lake sites in northeastern Alberta.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“All told, [the production cutbacks] should have an impact on prices,” said Phil Skolnick, analyst with Toronto-based Eight Capital Inc.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Tim McMillan, president of the Canadian Association of Petroleum producers, laid the current price slump at the feet of the Liberal government in Ottawa, saying its killing of the proposed Northern Gateway pipeline created the current shortage of pipeline capacity. In June, 2016, the federal court quashed the Northern Gateway approval by the former Conservative government over a failure to properly consult First Nations. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau sealed its fate when his government killed the proposed line through northern British Columbia later that year, while at the same time approving Enbridge’s Line 3 project and the Trans Mountain pipeline expansion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“This shouldn’t be a surprise to anyone,” Mr. McMillan said in an interview.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">Canadian Natural Resources</span> had a strong third quarter as prices differentials shrank over the summer before ballooning again in October. Its net income rose to $1.8-billion, or $1.47 a share in the quarter compared with $684-million, or 56 cents, a year earlier. Its average realized price of oil rose to US$57.89 a barrel from US$46.33, a year earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An earlier version of this article wrongly reported <span class="companylink">Canadian Natural Resources</span> complained about <span class="companylink">Enbridge Inc</span>.’s system of apportionment for export pipeline space. CNRL management was referring to the Alberta gathering system in the discussion on apportionment to pipeline space.</p>

</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Writing in Esquire after that speech, journalist Jack Holmes noted, correctly, that U.S. and global aims are not necessarily at odds with one another.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But then he went on to disparage nationalism itself, saying that in Trump's America it represented sexism, racism and the attempt to preserve white privilege.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It was not an uncommon reaction among progressives. But it had the practical effect of allowing Trump's appropriation of “nationalism” — a word with generally positive connotations in the U.S. — to stand.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Right-wingers, such as former Trump adviser Steve Bannon, have also taken over the term “economic nationalism” to describe their approach. In Canada, where economic nationalism has a long and venerable history, this seems particularly odd.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Here, economic nationalism is associated with the left and liberal left. Former Liberal finance minister Walter Gordon was an economic nationalist determined to decrease the power of the U.S. over Canada. During the free-trade election campaign of 1988, so was former Liberal prime minister John Turner.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Canadian Auto Workers, now Unifor, cited economic nationalism as one of the key reasons for breaking from its U.S. parent union. Under the banner of economic nationalism, the New Democrats forced Pierre Trudeau's minority Liberal government to set up a publicly owned Canadian oil company.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In those days, economic nationalism was seen as a check on what used to be called American imperialism. Now the word has been appropriated by those who would expand that imperial reach under the slogan “Make America great again.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the biggest rhetorical victory of the right has been its capture of the term “populist.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Historically in North America, populism has had both left and right variants. Some were anti-immigrant and racist. But the most successful, such as the People's Party of the late 19th century or the Progressives of the early 20th were left-leaning.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Canada, right-populist Social Credit controlled Alberta's government for decades. At about the same time, the left-populist Co-operative Commonwealth Federation, now the NDP, dominated politics in Saskatchewan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 1919, the agrarian populist United Farmers of Ontario won power at Queen's Park. In the '20s and '30s, the left-populist Progressives forced a reconfiguration of Canadian politics federally. Later in the century, a new right-of-centre, national, populist party called Reform forced another one.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In short, populism has been no stranger to either Canada or the U.S. So it seems odd that it has become, among left-liberals, a dirty word. Trump may be a populist. But so was the NDP's Tommy Douglas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bannon may call himself an economic nationalist. But so does Mel Watkins, the University of Toronto economist who helped to redefine Canadian politics in the 1970s and '80s.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">How did his happen? In part, we have forgotten our own history. Trumpism is not new. It is a big-man version of politics that in some ways echoes the time, decades ago, when Huey Long ran Louisiana and Mitch Hepburn controlled Ontario.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But in part we are ignoring the real game. In both Canada and the U.S. the left is finding itself trapped in the dead end of identity politics where the key aim is to divide the world into as many subsets as possible, each with its own particular grievance.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That has left it to the hard right to exploit the bigger, common grievances — of work, and wages and social class.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We have not only surrendered the field to the Trumpians. We have willingly allowed them to monopolize its language.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The AER pegs total liabilities for all oil and gas operations in the province at about $59-billion. However, documents released on Thursday show costs could be closer to $260-billion, a figure the regulator said represents a “worst-case scenario” of a complete and immediate industry shutdown. The records were initially obtained by online news site National Observer and later provided to The Globe.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a statement on Friday, the regulator said Mr. Ellis’s departure, effective Jan. 31, 2019, has been planned for several months and that it would begin an immediate search for his replacement.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Ellis joined the AER in 2013 and was the first to lead the agency after its merger with the provincial ministry in charge of environment and sustainable resources development.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The agency has struggled to cope as costs for oil-patch cleanup mount after a string of corporate bankruptcies in the sector. It has also come under fire for approving sales of oil and gas assets with high liabilities to companies who lacked the financial wherewithal to pay for cleanup, according to its own measure of financial fitness.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Under Mr. Ellis, the regulator launched an appeal to the Supreme Court to stop companies from dumping their least profitable wells through bankruptcy proceedings. A decision in the case is expected before the end of the year.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ellis has led the regulator since it was created in 2013, the result of merging two oil and gas development-related government agencies together.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The AER said it would begin the search for his replacement "immediately."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Thursday, the AER apologized for a "staggering" presentation, made last February by one of its highest-ranking officials.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The presentation warned the province's oilpatch that it could be sitting on an estimated $260 billion in financial liabilities in the event of a complete industry shutdown.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That's over $200 billion more than the previous calculation of $58.65 billion made public by the regulator.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The statement appeared to be at odds with Wadsworth's presentation notes, which said the $260-billion figure was likely to be a low estimate.</p>

</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A week ago, headline writers and pundits were falling over each other to declare Calgary’s bid for the 2026 Winter Olympics dead. Alberta and the federal government had both come out with their funding numbers and it was obvious there wasn’t enough money to pay for the Olympic budget, which called for roughly $3-billion in public money. Alberta and Calgary pointed the blame at the federal government, even though its proposed contribution − $1.5-billion − was pretty much exactly what had been expected. And the city gave Ottawa an ultimatum: come up with a better deal or the whole thing is off.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With a city council vote on Wednesday serving as a deadline, all three levels of government announced a last-minute funding proposal designed to save the bid. It was complicated, and used what some called “creative accounting” to allow the city to claim hundreds of millions of dollars in contributions − and unlock matching funding from the federal government − without actually spending any additional money.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But it also shaved off nearly $300-million from the budget in areas including security and housing, and only increased concerns that the event could come with steep cost overruns. And all three levels of government insist they won’t be on the hook if the Games go over budget.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Justin Giovannetti, Allan Maki and I examined what happened to the bid, and what happens next[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/canada/alberta/article-calgary-2026-what-happened-to-the-bid-and-what-comes-next/] . The funding proposal has set off more negotiations between the three governments as they iron out precisely how the Games would be funded. And there are some serious questions that need to be answered. Here’s just one: Calgary says it plans to find an insurance policy to cover cost overruns for a $20-million premium − would any insurer actually take on that risk?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And more immediately, Calgarians are set to vote in a plebiscite on Nov. 13. Some have likely already voted, since mail-in ballots have already been sent out. The rest have a little more than a week to make sense of what just happened, even though some city councillors acknowledge that they don’t entirely understand it.</p>

The province finally has its first private cannabis[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/cannabis/article-bc-licenses-first-private-cannabis-retailer-doubling-number-of/] retail shop licensed. The shop, expected to open next week in Kimberley, was once an illegal dispensary. Mike Hager notes that it will be a common path in British Columbia, where illegal retailers will shed their black-market ties to enter the legitimate marketplace.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Cannabis stores in other parts of the west, though, are running out of product after two weeks in business. In tiny Martensville, Sask., the supply was gone the day after legalization. As David Ebner and Marcy Nicholson report, on the Alberta Cannabis website, the most common phrase is “out of stock.”[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/cannabis/article-were-two-weeks-into-national-cannabis-legalization-wheres-the-pot/]

It’s the latest effort to address the Federal Court of Appeal’s decision to quash the Trans Mountain pipeline expansion.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, the opposition continues in British Columbia. Although the long-time stalwart critic of the Trans Mountain project, Burnaby mayor Derek Corrigan, was defeated in last weekend’s municipal election, his replacement remains opposed. Mike Hurley, a former firefighter, says he’s worried about the safety[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/canada/british-columbia/article-burnaby-mayor-elect-opposes-trans-mountain-expansion-over-possible/] of the oil-tank farm and the potential for a so-called “boil-over” fire.</p>

The relationship between the city’s developers and the former administration of Gregor Robertson was viewed with suspicion by voters, who didn’t return a single member of Mr. Robertson’s party to city council after last month’s vote. But as Frances Bula reports, the new mayor is going to need developers to pay their fees in order to realize his ambitious city plan.[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/canada/british-columbia/article-vancouver-mayor-elect-kennedy-stewart-says-city-is-open-for-business/]

They are finding there isn’t much out there to move into.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Earlier this year, the City of Vancouver announced a bold, new and aggressive step to clamping down on the owners of some of the city’s most derelict housing. After years of neglect and a pileup of bylaw infractions, the city said it would move to expropriate two single-room occupancy hotels owned by Vancouver’s Sahota family. But this week, Wendy Stueck and Mike Hager noted that the city has put that action on hold[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/canada/british-columbia/article-vancouver-pauses-effort-to-expropriate-sahota-owned-hotels-amid/] , an effort to come to a negotiated settlement.</p>

Surrey mayor-elect Doug McCallum’s disruptive plan to scrap a light-rail project in an effort to build the more expensive SkyTrain service has irritated his neighbouring mayors, who all must co-operate on transit initiatives in the region. Ian Bailey spoke with New Westminster’s Jonathan Coté, who has suggested Surrey should pay back[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/canada/british-columbia/article-mayor-of-new-westminster-says-surrey-should-pay-back-money-spent-on/] the $50-million already spent on the LRT.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The energy board is reviewing the project's impacts on the marine environment and Kennedy Stewart says it's too rushed, including a week-long window for Indigenous groups and others to apply to participate.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I do think the revamped <span class="companylink">NEB</span> process we're going through probably is going to fail again. I don't think giving First Nations a week to submit to a brand new reconciliation process is enough time and that'll be challenged in court again and rightly so," he said in an interview.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I could see this being deadlocked like the Mackenzie Valley pipeline for many, many, many years," he added, referring to a proposed natural gas line through the Northwest Territories that was stalled for decades.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Stewart, formerly the New Democrat MP for Burnaby South, was among a group of protesters who were arrested in March while blocking Trans Mountain's main gate, violating a court order to stay five metres from company work sites. He pleaded guilty to contempt of court and paid a $500 fine.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After winning Vancouver's mayoral race by fewer than 1,000 votes, he will be sworn in on Monday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">His opinion on the pipeline expansion hasn't changed, he said, and he will continue to back the city's practice of supporting local Indigenous groups in their court challenges by applying to be an intervener.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Tsleil-Waututh and Squamish Nations have traditional territories in the Vancouver area and both have said the new process is repeating the same mistakes and laying the groundwork for a new court challenge.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Federal Court of Appeal struck down the federal government's approval of the project in August due to inadequate Indigenous consultation and the energy board's failure to review impacts on the marine environment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's government, which has purchased the existing Trans Mountain line and expansion project for $4.5 billion, tasked the energy board with reviewing marine environment impacts and submitting a report by Feb. 22.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Energy board spokesman James Stevenson declined comment on Stewart's remarks but has said previously that the revamped review will be a comprehensive scientific and technical examination of project-related marine shipping.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Stewart said Trudeau was the one who brought up Trans Mountain during their first meeting Thursday since Stewart's election win.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I said, 'First of all, it's been a weird year. I was arrested, then I resigned as MP and now I'm mayor, within a period of about six months.' But my position on that was clear. I'm still very much opposed to this pipeline," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"However, I understand my role has changed. Perhaps where my mandate as MP in Burnaby was to stop the pipeline as a top priority, the voters of this city have said your priority is to fix our housing problem."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The pipeline expansion would triple the amount of oil being carried from the Edmonton area to a marine shipping terminal in Burnaby, increasing the number of tankers in Metro Vancouver waters seven-fold.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Stewart also said he told Trudeau that if the city takes any action against the project, he will call first to inform him.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Trudeau and Alberta Premier Rachel Notley have said the project is in the national interest because Alberta needs to get its oil to markets outside the U.S. where it can fetch higher prices, particularly in Asia.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Stewart said it's ridiculous that Canada exports oil in the west while importing oil in the east. The country should have a national energy strategy that involves refining products in Canada, particularly in the eastern part of the country, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"What ultimately would be the best thing to do is to ship Alberta oil east, make sure there's guaranteed supplies for existing or new refineries, so Canadians are using Canadian oil," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Trudeau addressed the Greater Vancouver Board of Trade before his meeting with Stewart on Thursday. The prime minister said the court's decision laid out a road map for his government to proceed with the project.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After meeting with Stewart, Trudeau said they agreed to make housing and infrastructure top priorities while diverging on the pipeline expansion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Obviously there's issues like TMX where we're going to disagree, but there's also an awful lot for us to work on together."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Environment Minister Catherine McKenna says the final regulations for the emission-pricing system for big industry are still in development but insists coal plants will pay a carbon price until national regulations force the plants out of existence by 2030.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The government's aim is by 2030 to ensure all of Canada's 17 existing coal plants will either stop operating entirely, be converted to natural gas, or use technologies such as carbon capture and storage to make their net greenhouse gas emissions virtually zero.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">However, Ottawa is still negotiating with provinces that have coal plants on how they will be phased out and whether they will be allowed to keep operating any of them by reducing equivalent emissions elsewhere.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2016, Canada had 16 coal generating stations, which operated 36 generators in five provinces. At least 20 of those generators are scheduled to be taken offline by 2030.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Alberta, which has 18 generators and accounts for almost half of the emissions from coal plants, is building new solar and wind generators to replace around two-thirds of its coal plants.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The others will be converted to natural gas, which produces around half the carbon dioxide produced by burning coal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Under the carbon price system for big emitters, plants will not pay the $20-per-tonne carbon price on all of the coal they burn to generate electricity. Rather, they will be affected by the carbon-pricing system for big emitters, which applies the price only to a portion of the emissions they produce.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The big emitters' pricing system will see an emissions cap set for every industry based on the average emissions produced by that sector, with industry paying the carbon tax on emissions over that cap.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For most industries, including coal plants, the cap will be 80 per cent of the average. For industries that are more exposed to foreign competition, such as cement, steel, nitrogen fertilizer and lime, the cap will be 90 per cent. Additional industries, such as oil and gas, are lobbying to be included in the 90-per-cent group and final decisions on that are to come early in 2019.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The system for big industry affects any facility that produces at least 50,000 tonnes of greenhouse gases a year and all of Canada's remaining coal plants are well above that marker. Together, Canada's coal plants produce almost one-10th of Canada's total emissions.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dundas and other oil and gas executives point out that U.S. regulatory processes are more predictable and streamlined, its regulations change less frequently and it takes less time to get regulatory approvals to develop a resource, which has led the industry to become increasingly critical about Canada as a jurisdiction to drill for oil and gas and less likely to invest here.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They also point to reports such as the <span class="companylink">World Economic Forum</span>'s Global Competitiveness Index ranking, which was updated on Oct. 16. Canada fell two places and is now the 12th most competitive jurisdiction in the world.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The WEF ranked the U.S. first overall, which oil and gas executives say is significant because it has become Canada's main competitor for investment dollars in the energy industry - a trend that Dundas called a "massive change that changed everything."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Capital spending in the U.S. oil and gas sector rose 38 per cent to $120 billion last year, Reynold Tetzlaff, Pricewaterhouse-Coopers LLP national energy leader, said in an email, citing data compiled by the <span class="companylink">Fraser Institute</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The U.S. is more competitive in the oil and gas market today," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now, Canadian-domiciled oil and gas producers are getting more vocal about the issue.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There are four key challenges facing the oil and natural gas industry: market access, regulatory effectiveness, cost structure and fiscal competitiveness," <span class="companylink">Canadian Natural Resources Ltd</span>. said in an emailed statement.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CNRL is Canada's largest upstream oil and gas producer with daily production exceeding one million barrels per day, or more than 20 per cent of the country's total production.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It is imperative that we maintain our high regulatory and environmental standards while also overcoming these challenges," the company said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Federal Finance Minister Bill Morneau has said Ottawa is tracking Canadian business competitiveness and regulatory burdens relative to the U.S., which also has the advantage of getting recent major tax cuts. But his government has not announced any changes yet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As it stands, the energy industry blames a combination of provincial and federal governments for what they call "duplicative" and incremental regulations that hurt business competitiveness without improving environmental stewardship.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This month, staff from Environment and Climate Change Minister Catherine McKenna's office flew to Calgary to meet with chief executives from major pipeline and oilsands companies and listen to criticism about Bill C-69, which would reorganize the <span class="companylink">National Energy Board</span> and establish a new assessment agency, and their urging for it to die on the order paper.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Caroline Theriault, an Environment and Climate Change spokesperson, said the government will continue to meet with stakeholders in the energy sector and that "Bill C-69 is supported by many in the resource sector across the country."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But industry executives say the legislation will further stymie investment in the resource sector by introducing new and unpredictable regulatory reviews, and prevent new pipelines from being built in the country. They have repeatedly stated they want Bill C-69, currently before the Senate, to die on the order paper.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In addition to new pipelines, PwC's Tetzlaff said the energy industry needs to see a Canadian response to the U.S.'s tax reforms and efforts to streamline the regulatory processes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We need to utilize all of these components to regain our edge as an energy leader," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It already takes weeks longer to get well licences in Alberta than in places such as Texas, according to a report published in September by the <span class="companylink">Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers</span>, the industry's largest advocacy group.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The report noted that oil and gas companies wait between 79 and 119 days for a routine well licence in Alberta, compared to between 30 and 60 days in Texas. For non-routine well applications, or applications for which "statements of concern" are filed by interveners, the timelines in Texas can be up to 190 days shorter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The report was particularly critical of the regulatory process in Alberta, where it can take up to six years to get approval for a steam-based oilsands project.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"What we should strive for is a streamlined and efficient regulatory system that maintains the standards that Canadians expect," CAPP chief executive Tim Mc-Millan said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He said CAPP and several individual companies have been meeting with politicians about the issue for years, but "over the last few years, it has gotten worse."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For example, McMillan noted Mick Mulvaney, one of U.S. President Donald Trump's cabinet members and the director of the Office of Management and Budget, has asked all other U.S. federal government departments to put forward plans to streamline their regulatory processes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"You see the results," he said. "Capital growth in the U.S. oil and gas industry is up almost 40 per cent this year. In Canada, it is declining."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Alberta Energy Regulator, which oversees oil and gas activity in the province, disagreed with some of the timelines CAPP highlighted in its report.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The AER posts estimated application processing times on its website and meets the targets more than 90 per cent of the time," spokesperson Monica Hermary said in an email.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She added that longer timelines could arise from complex development or factors that are outside the regulator's control, "including if the application is incomplete or if stakeholder consultation requirements have not been met."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hermary said the AER is working with the energy industry, including CAPP, "to gather input on how to make the regulatory system more efficient and the areas we need to focus on that will make a positive difference."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But for producers that have already shifted their capital spending to the U.S., it will be difficult to draw them back without major changes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Enerplus'Dundas said the company has now developed assets in the U.S. as a base for future growth rather than in Canada.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Our assets today in Canada do not support a shift back," he said.</p>

<span class="companylink">Imperial Oil Ltd</span>.'s quarterly profit more than doubled to easily beat estimates on Friday, benefiting from a record production at Kearl oilsands in Alberta, its largest project.

</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The lack of pipeline capacity is an issue that needs no repeating here today. But Alberta continues to produce more and more oil and, lacking the pipes and trains to take it all, it is now running out of storage capacity for extracted oil, too. This is contributing to even more downward pressure on the price of Alberta crude, which already sells at a deep discount compared with global prices because Alberta producers are in such a weak position. As the Financial Post's Geoffrey Morgan reported recently, the kind of heavy crude produced in Alberta that was recently trading at US$19.49 in Hardisty, Alta., was simultaneously worth US$64.74 in Houston - if you could somehow find a way to get it there.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When the Ontario auto sector's ability to export parts and vehicles into the U.S. market was threatened by U.S. President Donald Trump, the federal Liberal government hurried to come to terms with Americans on a new trade deal. When the protectionist Trump slapped tariffs on Canadian steel and aluminum exports, Ottawa immediately responded with targeted retaliatory tariffs of our own.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But when Alberta's pipeline capacity is so constrained that it must warehouse valuable crude even as prices reach levels not seen in years, what does Ottawa do? It nationalizes the existing Trans Mountain pipeline in hopes it can expand it later. Much later, evidently.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's hard not to notice how to this Liberal government, a threat to Canadian exports that occurs in Central Canada is a crisis requiring an immediate solution, while a threat in the West ... is not. One could further compare and contrast the lack of help to Alberta with favours lavished upon Quebec's aviation sector, or (largely) Eastern Canadian dairy farmers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the meantime, Alberta carries on as best it can. But the province has been unfairly targeted by activists who have manipulated governments in B.C. and Ottawa into stymieing exports of oil, costing our economy billions, even while production continues to grow.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We are all poorer for this inexcusable fiasco. And until Alberta gets the pipelines it needs, all Canadians will continue to pay the price of this failure. Quite literally.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">EDMONTON—Donating to charity is down across all age groups, and it's unlikely to bounce back any time soon due to a trend of younger Canadians giving less to charity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A report released Thursday by CanadaHelps, a portal to donate to charitable organizations, found that 20.4 per cent of Canadians donated to charities in 2015. That's down from 24.6 per cent in 2006.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Canadians 55 and older donated $6.4 billion to charity in 2015, the largest amount for any age group and nearly double the $3.5 billion given by Canadians aged 25 to 54.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, Canadians aged 45 to 54 saw a 6.4 per cent decline in charitable giving, the largest drop among all age groups.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Marina Glogovac, president and CEO of CanadaHelps, says the demographic shift could create a funding crisis for Canadian charities because it's unlikely Canadians in the 45 to 54 age group will suddenly decide to be more generous when they turn 55.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I've been aware for a while that giving in Canada has increasingly been falling on the shrinking pool of older donors,” Glogovac said. “Although there is less of them, they're actually giving more on average. And as a cohort, they'll need to be replaced.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Alberta, 33 per cent of families claimed charitable donations in 2016, down from 37 per cent in 2010.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Peter Popkowski Leszczyc, a marketing professor at the University of Alberta, runs an online auction site focused on charities. While he couldn't offer specific numbers, he said there's been a noticeable decline in donations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I've noticed that in the past number of years, there definitely has been a decrease in the auction outcomes,” Leszczyc said. “In Alberta, it's very noticeable because of the oil money.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Leszczyc presents several reasons as to why Canadians under 55 are giving less. For one, the sheer number of charitable organizations nationwide can be overwhelming for citizens.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“There's been an increase in the number of charities, but people may be almost overburdened by too many charities all asking for money,” he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The internet and crowdfunding campaigns are also playing a role, especially among millennials, Leszczyc said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Crowdfunding platforms aren't considered charitable donations by CanadaHelps, but they are increasingly the method younger Canadians decide to use to give back to causes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But people often give less than they would to a traditional charity because of the option to do so anonymously.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“What we're seeing happening on the internet is people are giving smaller donations. They may give more frequent ones, but it wouldn't be that surprising that the total amount would be less,” Leszczyc said. “It may be much easier for someone to give a smaller amount when it's anonymous on the internet.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He also points to immigration, saying newcomers tend to be more suspicious of charities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There's also the general trend of a higher cost of living, especially in large Canadian cities. For that reason, younger Canadians may decide to give back by volunteering rather than giving cash, Glogovac said.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Progressive Conservative Leader Blaine Higgs, a 64-year-old engineer and former finance minister, was hired by Irving Oil a week after he graduated from the <span class="companylink">University of New Brunswick</span>. He was eventually promoted to director of distribution, overseeing oil transportation across eastern Canada and New England.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">His extensive big business experience has informed his approach to politics. Higgs refers to citizens as customers, and his campaign for the Sept. 24 election was replete with references to getting results.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I came from a company where you had to deliver results in order to survive," Higgs said when he released the Progressive Conservative platform.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"(New Brunswickers) are paying the bills but they're not getting the service to reflect the amount of money being spent."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Higgs had promised to cut government waste and balance the province's budget in two years — a year earlier than his outgoing rival, Liberal Premier Brian Gallant.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And like other right-of-centre politicians, he also promised not to raise taxes, while offering a modest spending plan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We will set lofty goals and achieve them. We don't need more taxes, we need results," Higgs said Friday after Gallant's government fell on a confidence vote.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We ran a principled campaign and ran on the belief that New Brunswick needs better service from the political leaders."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tom Bateman, a political science professor at St. Thomas University in Fredericton, says as a former Irving executive, Higgs will face scrutiny when weighing just about any government decision.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There is an imbalance that would create that perception with any government," he said. "Mr. Higgs would be well aware of that perception and would want to disabuse people of the idea that he was a cipher for the Irving companies."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The company is one of the province's largest employers, with interests in forestry, pulp and paper, transportation, oil refining and distribution, retail, media outlets and shipbuilding. Canadian Business magazine says the privately owned empire was thought to be worth $7.8 billion, making the Irving family the eighth richest in Canada.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The interactions between public policy and the Irvings are multitudinous," Bateman said. "It's a very large and influential group of companies in a province that is very small and short on alternative means of economic development."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Before the election campaign began, the Liberals took aim at Higgs' business background, saying he has opposed minimum-wage increases, income tax increases for the richest New Brunswickers and a plan to make tuition free for some post-secondary students.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"He wants to help the wealthy and large corporations," Gallant said at the time. "And he's demonstrated that in his voting record as leader of the Opposition."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Liberals also produced a series of attack ads, which included the slogan: "Blaine Higgs puts big business first."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">However, no one in the province was surprised when the Liberal cabinet ministers who unveiled the negative ads made a point of not mentioning the Irving brand.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bad-mouthing the Irvings is bad politics in New Brunswick.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And it's been that way since Higgs was growing up in Forest City, N.B., near the Canada-U.S. border. The son of a customs officer, he married his high school sweetheart, Marcia, and settled down in Saint John, where they had four daughters: Lindsey, Laura, Sarah and Rachel.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The couple celebrated their 40th wedding anniversary this summer and now have three grandchildren.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">First elected to the New Brunswick legislature in 2010 — four months after he retired from Irving — he served as finance minister for four years. He was elected as Tory leader in October 2016.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On the national stage, Higgs isn't expected to ruffle too many feathers. Unlike Ontario Premier Doug Ford, Higgs is no populist.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"His message isn't that different from previous premiers," said J.P. Lewis, a political scientist at the University of New Brunswick in Saint John. "He's more like a traditional Progressive Conservative. He's like a Harper-era cabinet minister."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, Higgs and Prime Minister Justin Trudeau are expected to clash over how to deal with climate change.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Higgs has said he will join with his counterparts in Ontario and Saskatchewan in rejecting Ottawa's bid to get the provinces to impose a carbon tax on their citizens.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last month, Manitoba Premier Brian Pallister said his province would also scrap plans for a carbon tax. As well, Jason Kenney, leader of Alberta's Opposition, has promised to repeal the province's carbon tax if his party wins the 2019 spring election.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Based on (Higgs') rhetoric, he could become another thorn in the side of Trudeau, especially when it comes to natural resources," Lewis said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Higgs also faces a daunting task in turning around the province's economy, which some economists have said is headed for a "fiscal cliff." Carrying a $14 billion debt, it could be pushed over the edge if there's a sharp rise in interest rates or a credit-rating downgrade.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The province has the nation's lowest median household income, and was the only province that recorded a population decline between 2011 and 2016. As well, its tax base is shrinking and the province has suffered through consecutive deficit budgets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economic growth — forecasted by the <span class="companylink">Conference Board</span> to be about 1.3 per cent this year — is expected to remain sluggish as the province struggles to increase its population.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We can fix this," Higgs said before the election campaign. "We have to be straight with each other and talk about real issues, not pretend all is well."</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prairie Iron Motorworks is a prime example of local success driven by passion</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even on sunny summer days, Darcy Epp, the owner of Prairie Iron Motorworks, an independent motorcycle repair shop on Sargent Avenue, doesn't get many opportunities to ride his own motorcycle — but he's totally OK with that.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Watching a satisfied customer ride away happy on their bike after I've just serviced it is about the best feeling in the world," says Epp, who recently celebrated his second year in business.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's taken a whole lot of hard work to reach this milestone.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Epp, 43, graduated from the <span class="companylink">Harley-Davidson</span> technicians course at Grand Prairie Regional College's Fairview campus in Alberta back in 2004. For about a dozen years, he turned wrenches at several different Winnipeg motorcycle dealerships — and even spent time building custom trikes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If there's one thing Epp learned working for others, it was that he really didn't like working for others.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I'm finally in charge and it feels great to do things the way I see fit," Epp says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I get to take the credit when it's good and the blame when it's bad, which wasn't always the way it went working for others."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Epp comes by his passion for motorcycles honestly. His late father, Ray Merel, was a fan of British bikes and although Darcy was only eight when Ray passed away, he left his young son with a pair of vintage bikes to tinker with — a 1956 Triumph and a 1955 BSA, motorcycles he still owns today.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The location Epp chose for his shop, a strip mall in a mainly industrial area at 1865 Sargent Ave., was no accident. It is actually the former home of Thunder Road Motorcycles, once owned by Ted Hector, a Manitoba Motorsports Hall of Fame 2013 inductee and all-around good guy, who retired from the motorcycle business a few years ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I decided if I was going to open my own shop it was now or never and, when thinking of a location, Ted's old shop came to mind. I checked it out and, sure enough, the location was vacant," Epp says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“It is a small space, but the rent is cheap and it has plenty of history, so it just seemed like a good fit."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although Epp made a few changes and brightened the place up a bit, the mural in the showroom is still intact, and an old leather jacket Hector left behind hangs on a hook upstairs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To help get started, Epp, who is Métis, received a loan from the Louis Riel Capital Corporation, a Manitoba Métis-owned lending institution created to finance the startup, acquisition and or expansion of viable Métis-controlled small businesses based in Manitoba. He also had loads of help from friends and family getting the shop set up — and huge support from his mother, Paulette, his No. 1 fan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So far, Epp's first experience as a business owner has been largely positive — aside, of course, from the monumental stress associated with being a business owner.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Epp hasn't been losing any sleep though, in fact, most nights he's asleep as soon as his head hits the pillow — 14 hour days will do that to a guy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The average day for Epp begins before 8 a.m., and he's often at the shop well into the evening. When he signed the lease, the property owner made it clear he didn't want Epp sleeping in the shop. Although he goes home every night, the shop is indeed his second home.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“If there's work to do, I will stay late and get it done," he says. “If I take on the job, my goal is to get it done right and get it done on time."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the summer months, many of his customers rely on their bike for daily transportation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And, when the weather looks good for the weekend, the requests for fresh tires and oil changes can be challenging to keep up with, but he enjoys the work and only takes on as much as he can handle.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although Epp has a passion for old British bikes, he doesn't typically work on those at Prairie Iron.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He does -routine maintenance on newer bikes, even if they are still under factory warranty, but the majority of the motorcycles he services and repairs are <span class="companylink">Harley-Davidson</span> models, typically a few years old and off warranty, as well as older metric cruisers from <span class="companylink">Honda</span>, Suzuki, Kawasaki and <span class="companylink">Yamaha</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Epp is also a trike specialist and recently converted a customer's Harley-Davidson Softail model into a mean looking Frankenstein Trike — due to health reasons the owner was no longer able to ride and the trike conversion got him back in the wind.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prairie Iron has dealer accounts with several parts companies throughout Canada and the U.S., notably Drag Specialties, and can obtain most of the parts required for the bikes Epp works on in a day or two.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many of the tires and general maintenance parts required can quickly be sourced right here in Winnipeg from a couple of local wholesale distributors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With the bad weather fast approaching, Epp is also in the motorcycle storage business — he's got about a dozen bikes masterfully stored in his small showroom.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The bikes not only look good, but they will help pay the rent and keep the lights on throughout the winter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Epp has relied on social media to spread the word about his company, and like any small business, he relies heavily on customer referrals.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ultimately though, the secret to his success thus far has been the quality of his work — Epp's attention to detail shines through brightly in everything he touches and he truly is a talented technician.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He especially enjoys enhancing engines — making bikes run great is always a sure way to keep customers happy — and he's become an expert at handlebar replacement, a popular upgrade with the Harley crowd.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Anything I can do to someone's bike to make it unique to them is great," Epp says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That specialized service is a big part of his success, and it takes time. But the payoff is well worth it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“It is a lot of fun working with a customer, helping them order the right parts and then putting it all together for them, and when they see their bike finished for the first time, that reaction is always a blast."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Winter can certainly be challenging for any motorcycle shop, especially a small one, but Epp already has a few customer projects on the go and is hoping to schedule more work for the winter months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When we visited, he was booking in a bike for a tire change — apparently the owner is hauling his bike, and himself, south for the winter. Lucky devil.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The store, in north Edmonton at 12451 97 St. N.W., has closed twice due to lack of product since it opened on legalization day, said manager Roseanne Dampier.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“If we place an order today, we might maybe see it next week,” Dampier said. “So if we start running low before we get that order in, we might have to close for a few days.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Alberta Liquor, Gaming and Cannabis spokesperson Kaleigh Miller said the problem in the supply chain is with licensed producers, who have not been able to keep up with demand.</p>

Post cannabis-legalization, a budding hemp industry takes root in Alberta[https://www.thestar.com/news/cannabis/2018/10/29/post-cannabis-legalization-a-budding-hemp-industry-takes-root-in-alberta.html]
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We continue to get shipments, but it's not at the agreed upon levels … from Day 1, they've been low on the shipping,” Miller said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“This is kind of the first hurdle we've faced that we really have no control over,” she added.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Miller could not provide an exact tally of how much cannabis AGLC has in its warehouses, but she said there does not seem to be a “robust amount” across the country, citing stores that have closed as far away as Quebec.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She also did not have numbers for how much product is available on the government's online order website, but said when she last checked, there were about nine of 115 products available.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We're definitely on the lower end, but it's fluctuating,” she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dampier says that smaller independent retail shops like Alternative Greens are having a harder time getting deliveries than the larger chains. She said they're receiving shipments of product bi-weekly — if they're lucky.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Numo Cannabis, at 11733 95 St. in the Alberta Avenue neighbourhood, has faced similar issues. The cannabis store has had to close two or three times since opening, said manager Daniel Nguyen.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We were out, now we're fully restocked and should be open for the rest of the weekend … I don't think anyone could have known how much of a massive demand there was,” he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Nguyen is confident things will get smoother in the new year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“There's no way it's going to continue like this or otherwise stores are going to start shutting down,” he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">AGLC works with 15 licensed producers to source its product and said it is actively reaching out to more.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jeffrey Gossain, vice-president of operations at licensed producer Atlas Growers in Alberta, said the company got a heads up from AGLC that demand has been extremely high.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We're ramping up our production just for that exactly,” Gossain said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After receiving a cultivation licence two weeks ago, it is now in talks with <span class="companylink">Health Canada</span> to get a sales licence. Gossain said <span class="companylink">Health Canada</span> has been proactive and “co-operating heavily” to try to get more licensed producers selling in bulk.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“They're trying to basically speed things up to kind of help get the supply online faster,” he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">Health Canada</span> has licensed 132 producers nationwide, with nine in Alberta.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In an emailed statement, Health Canada spokesperson Tammy Jarbeau said at the end of September, licensed producers had reported they had shipped more than 14,500 kilograms of dried cannabis and 370 litres of cannabis oil to retailers. They also reported they still had an inventory of 90,000 kilograms of dried cannabis and 41,000 litres of cannabis oil.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“<span class="companylink">Health Canada</span> remains confident that there is sufficient supply of cannabis overall to meet market demand now and into the future,” she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the federal department acknowledges it has also observed localized shortages in some markets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“This was expected and will likely continue in the months ahead,” the statement says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">Health Canada</span> says 89 companies have been licensed to produce in the last 16 months, more than double the number of licensees in the prior four years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The agency has also granted 191 expansion amendments, bringing the total square footage of licensed facilities in Canada from two million square feet to more than 13 million.</p>

<span class="companylink">Encana Corp</span>. is paying US$5.5-billion to add a new American oil-production region to its operations, saying the deal will lead to higher dividends and share buybacks.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the move sparked a heavy sell-off, as investors worried that <span class="companylink">Encana</span>, which has spent years pruning its operations, is entering a new region with its stock at a weak point, and paying for it with shares. <span class="companylink">Encana</span> tumbled 13 per cent on Thursday</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">Encana</span> is buying Houston-based <span class="companylink">Newfield Exploration Co</span>., giving it a sizable foothold in an Oklahoma shale play known as the Stack/Scoop. It would become <span class="companylink">Encana</span>’s third major U.S. operating region after the Permian and Eagle Ford areas of Texas, sites of drilling booms.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Newfield shareholders will get 2.6719 <span class="companylink">Encana</span> shares for each Newfield share. <span class="companylink">Encana</span> will also assume US$2.2-billion of Newfield debt.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The purchase will boost <span class="companylink">Encana</span>’s production by more than 50 per cent to 577,000 barrels of oil equivalent a day. It can employ the same high-tech drilling technology the company has been successful using in its other operations, chief executive Doug Suttles said. He told analysts that <span class="companylink">Encana</span> has watched the play develop since he became CEO five years ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“If you go all the way back to our strategy work in 2013, we identified this as a basin that was going to be a premium basin. We think it’s ready to take off, and it fit well with us,” Mr. Suttles said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">Encana</span> said it plans to raise its dividend by 25 per cent next year, and increase the amount it has earmarked for buying back shares to US$1.5-billion. Given that it will be issuing 535 million shares to pay for Newfield, the buyback sends a mixed message. Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce analyst Jon Morrison called that aspect “perplexing.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Newfield also has smaller operations in North Dakota and Utah, though those are not key to future expansion for <span class="companylink">Encana</span>, Mr. Suttles said. Instead, it will concentrate on the Oklahoma assets, along with its Texas oil production and liquids-rich natural gas in the Montney and Duvernay regions of Alberta and British Columbia.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The deal surprised investors. <span class="companylink">Encana</span> has sought to sharpen its focus by concentrating on four very large plays, and jettisoning those with lesser prospects. In recent years, it had settled on the four in Canada and the United States. It used proceeds from asset sales to pay down debt as the industry downturn dragged on.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It does not appear that <span class="companylink">Encana</span> is overpaying for Newfield; the larger concern is that it is straying from its strategy to an area where it has no current presence, which limits operating savings, said Eric Nuttall, senior portfolio manager at Ninepoint Partners. <span class="companylink">Encana</span> said it expects to save US$250-million annually, though that includes general and administrative costs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The deal comes after weeks of steep declines in the shares of oil producers, including <span class="companylink">Encana</span> and Newfield. With Thursday’s steep drop, <span class="companylink">Encana</span> is down 33 per cent in the past month. In the same period, U.S. benchmark crude has fallen 16 per cent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“At best, they now need to prove that they can right the [Newfield] ship with their operational expertise, which will take two to three quarters, a long time for the market to wait in a [weak] energy market,” Mr. Nuttall said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The deal would mean <span class="companylink">Encana</span> derives a much larger proportion of its revenue from the United States, raising questions about the Calgary-based company’s long-term aims for Canada. Earlier this year, Mr. Suttles relocated to the company’s Denver office. He said on Thursday the new assets will be run from Newfield’s office in Houston.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We call it a headquarterless model. We’ll have three locations: Calgary, Denver and Houston, and actually the work happens where the people are, as opposed to the opposite,” he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">Encana</span> reported third-quarter profit of US$39-million, or four cents a share, down from year-earlier US$294-million, or 30 cents. The most recent figure included a non-cash hedging charge of US$164-million. Production rose 33 per cent to 378,200 barrels of oil equivalent a day.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The sector's accumulated environmental liability is currently estimated at $58.65 billion, less than one quarter of the presented number, it said in a statement Thursday.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The numbers are staggering — $260 billion in total liability, which is $200 billion more than we have consistently reported," it stated.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"This particular estimate was created for a presentation to try and hammer home the message to industry that the current liability system needs improvement. While the message to address liability is important, the numbers were not validated and were based on a hypothetical worst-case scenario.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Using these estimates was an error in judgement and one we deeply regret."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The $260 billion is mentioned in speaking notes for a presentation in February by Robert Wadsworth, the AER's vice-president of closure and liability, as initially obtained by the National Observer after a request under freedom of information legislation</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The AER provided the same documents to The Canadian Press on Thursday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a graphic illustrated by a huge cartoon bag of money, the presentation estimates Alberta's liabilities at $130 billion for mining projects, $100 billion for conventional oil and gas and steam-driven oilsands, and $30 billion for pipelines.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The money bags are to scale," it says. "There is a bag for security, it is just very hard to see."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Issues emerging from the presentation are being examined by Environment Minister Shannon Phillips, said Premier Rachel Notley on Thursday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's a problem that has accrued over, I guess now we'd be talking 47 years, but it's not one that happened overnight and, unfortunately, it's not one that we can fix overnight," she told reporters.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She said the government is having talks with industry about the situation and is taking care to avoid approving projects that will add to the liabilities going forward.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CALGARY — Tensions caused by steep price discounts for western Canadian heavy oil are dominating discourse as Calgary-based oilsands producers roll out third-quarter results.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Tim McKay, president of Canadian Natural Resources Ltd., charged Thursday that unnamed energy industry members are deliberately interfering with attempts to make pipelines run more efficiently because they are making "windfall revenues" from current discount prices on western Canadian oil production.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">His company and rivals <span class="companylink">Cenovus Energy Inc</span>. and <span class="companylink">MEG Energy Corp</span>. have all announced production cuts to avoid selling at least some barrels of bitumen in the current low price environment that they hope will begin to recover sometime next year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other producers including <span class="companylink">Suncor Energy Inc</span>. and <span class="companylink">Husky Energy Inc</span>. say their upgrading and refining capacity and firm access to pipelines mean they can continue to produce at capacity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">All blame a lack of export pipeline capacity to match growing heavy oil production for discounts of up to US$52 per barrel being paid for Western Canadian Select bitumen blend in comparison with New York-traded West Texas Intermediate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But McKay said the situation is "exacerbated" by the inability of the industry's Crude Oil Logistics Committee, which represents producers, refiners, shippers, pipeline owners and regulators to make crude oil pipeline traffic decisions, to adjust rules to optimize the process of assigning pipeline space to members.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It is taking some time as clearly some parties, who capture windfall revenues at the expense of Alberta citizens and Alberta producers, are determined to continue to capture windfall revenues," he charged on a call to discuss third-quarter results.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Canadian Natural announced it is curtailing heavy crude oil production amounting to between 10,000 and 15,000 barrels per day in October and 45,000 and 55,000 bpd for November and December. The company has current output of over one million barrels of oil equivalent per day of heavy, light and synthetic oil, as well as natural gas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Full pipelines have led to shippers "nominating" more barrels than they can or need to ship in hope they will get more barrels out if <span class="companylink">Enbridge Inc</span>. has to "apportion" space on its Mainline system, said analyst Jennifer Rowland of Edward Jones.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If the shipper doesn't use all the space allotted, it results in "air barrels" going to market, she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It hurts because if the Mainline doesn't run optimally, then you're not getting the maximum amount of barrels out of Canada as you could be and that has a direct negative impact to the differential," she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The committee members who are most likely to benefit are U.S. refiners who buy cheap Canadian oil and turn it into products for sale to U.S. consumers, analysts said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Enbridge export pipelines are running as full as possible and modifications to the nomination process won't change that, said spokeswoman Tracie Kenyon in an email.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She said the Logistics Committee deals with pipelines and terminals in the province upstream of the Mainline system, adding Enbridge has its own nomination verification and apportionment process.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We have been consulting with our shippers since the spring on whether modifications to that process are required, and those discussions continue," she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Wednesday, Cenovus said it would slow production from its steam-driven oilsands wells using a similar process that cut 40,000 to 50,000 barrels per day for six or seven weeks early this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Thursday, MEG said it would move a maintenance shutdown scheduled for next year to the current quarter, reducing fourth-quarter output by 4,000 to 6,000 bpd.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Suncor CEO Steve Williams, meanwhile, said Thursday his company's Fort Hills oilsands mine, the newest in Alberta, will ramp up to an average of 90 per cent of its 194,000-barrel-per-day capacity, with all of its production able to get to market via contracted pipeline space.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He said the company plans to return cash to shareholders next year with more share buybacks and a likely increase in dividend.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The museum is named in his honour.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tyrrell, who died in Toronto in 1957 at the age of 98, had worked for the <span class="companylink">Geological Survey of Canada</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After discovering coal near Fernie, B.C., he was sent to southern Alberta to lead a team of researchers exploring an area north of the Bow River.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They found coal deposits in the Red Deer river valley, which became the country's largest base for domestic coal mining until the discovery of oil and gas in Leduc in 1947.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Drumheller was the area that fuelled Canada for decades," said Making. "He was instrumental in bringing Drumheller on the map for that."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She said Tyrrell was out exploring the Badlands when he stumbled across his next significant discovery.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"He came upon this fearsome-looking skull buried in the hills, which ironically is only about five kilometres from where the museum is situated now," said Making. "It just shows how rich the area is in paleotological fossils and discoveries."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The skull was named Albertosaurus sarcophagus — flesh-eating lizard from Alberta — in 1905, the same year Alberta became a province.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Making hopes the <span class="companylink">Google</span> doodle will help Canadians better understand their past.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"He's always an icon here at the museum," she said. "His discovery of the Albertosaurus actually led to what's considered the first waves of fossil hunting in Canada and a lot of the discoveries that came from that ended up in museums around the world."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On its site, <span class="companylink">Google</span> said the doodles are changes made to its usual logo to celebrate holidays, anniversaries and the lives of famous artists, pioneers and scientists.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The company says is has created more than 2,000 doodles for home pages around the world.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"A group of Googlers get together regularly to brainstorm and decide which events will be celebrated with a doodle," said the website. "The ideas for the doodles come from numerous sources including Googlers and <span class="companylink">Google</span> users."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Making said she wishes she knew who was behind Thursday's <span class="companylink">Google</span> doodle.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I would love to take credit for the doodle, but I can't," she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I'd love to know who suggested it and thank them. It meant a lot, it really did."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Toronto, stocks in the oilpatch could get a boost as <span class="companylink">Encana Corp</span>. announced it would buy <span class="companylink">Newfield Exploration Co</span>. for $5.5-billion to make it one of the biggest shale oil producers in North America.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Most investors will be happy to put the month of October behind them as all North American markets saw a sharp decline across most sectors. It was the worst month for the S&P 500 since September, 2011.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Wednesday, the Dow and the S&P/TSX Composite Index posted their second consecutive day of triple-digit gains. In Toronto, energy and marijuana stocks led the charge. Still, the market lost 6.5 per cent in October. The U.S. markets were helped by good results late Tuesday by <span class="companylink">Facebook</span>, followed by strong reports by GM, <span class="companylink">Estee Lauder</span> and other large companies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Overseas, global stocks started the new month on firmer ground on Thursday after a brutal October, while sterling rallied on reports that Britain and the <span class="companylink">European Union</span> are close to a post-Brexit deal on financial services.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The MSCI All-Country World Index, which tracks stocks in 47 countries, was up 0.3 per cent on the day.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">October was the index’s worst month since May 2012 – a loss of 7.5 per cent – as shares globally took a battering on a number of factors ranging from trade wars to concerns about the global economy and higher U.S. interest rates.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite the dollar’s slide, some analysts were cautious about further declines given the headwinds for the global economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Friday’s U.S. employment data could also reinforce the view that the U.S. economy is outperforming rivals, sending money back into the buck.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“After a very difficult month of October for risk assets, overnight we saw across the board strength in EM (emerging market) and higher beta FX, partly helped by the announcement of Chinese stimulus,” ING analysts said in a note to clients.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Yet, with the combination of ongoing overhang of trade wars, the tightening Fed and the U.S. economy outperforming its G10 peers, we don’t expect such across-the-board EM FX rallies versus the USD to be long lasting.”</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Labor Department says the rise in productivity in the July-September period follows a 3 per cent rate of gain in the second quarter, which had been the strongest increase in three years. Labour costs rose at a 1.2 per cent rate after having fallen at a 1 per cent rate in the second quarter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Productivity, the amount of output per hour of work, has been weak throughout the current recovery. Analysts have been unable to come up with definitive reasons for the slowdown.</p>

All Rights Reserved. </td></tr>
<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The rising cost of gasoline is forcing small-business owners to cut costs in order to cope with what experts say will be the new normal for fuel prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Gasoline costs have risen by about 15 per cent year-over-year for Jason Boyne’s Goodbye Graffiti business. Mr. Boyne owns three of the franchises, including two in the Vancouver area and one in the Ottawa region.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">His company uses gasoline to fuel his eight heavy-duty <span class="companylink">Ford</span> F350 and Dodge 3500 trucks and the power washing equipment he uses to remove graffiti. The burner used to heat the water uses diesel, which has also risen in price.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The biggest cost for us is filling up the trucks,” says Mr. Boyne, who says his business now pays about $160 to fill up each truck in the Vancouver area, where gasoline prices hit a record of $161.90 at the end of April.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While gas prices are highest in B.C.’s Lower Mainland​, the price at the pumps is climbing across Canada.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The spike in fuel prices comes alongside other rising costs for small-business owners, ranging from wages and new payroll taxes to increased costs from suppliers as a ripple effect moves across the supply chain.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“All of that gets translated to higher costs for our consumers,” says Mr. Boyne, who recently increased his minimum rate by $10 to $199.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“It also affects my ability to give raises to my staff,” says Mr. Boyne, who has shelved a plan to provide his employees a registered retirement savings plan program this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To offset higher gasoline prices, Mr. Boyne tries to fill the trucks when prices dip and when the vehicles are outside of Metro Vancouver, where prices are lower because they don’t include a local transit authority levy. “But it’s not always convenient,” he says. “I’m not going to send my truck out [of the area] just to fill up.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Buying new, lower-emission vehicles isn’t possible either, given the huge capital expense. “The only thing we can do is raise our prices,” Mr. Boyne says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Business owners across Canada are paying about 15 per cent to 20 per cent more for fuel this year versus the same time last year, driven largely by the rising price of oil, says GasBuddy senior petroleum analyst Dan McTeague. A weaker Canadian dollar, limited refinery supplies and a new carbon price in provinces such as B.C. mean the price is expected to remain high – at least for the coming months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“If you’re a business … this is definitely going to bite,” Mr. McTeague says. “This is the new normal – these higher prices remain firm.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With both consumers and business owners paying more at the pumps, there’s an expectation that both groups will spend less on goods and services, which in turn will also hurt businesses. “Look for people to keep whatever products they have longer and for capital expenditures to be repurposed or redevoted towards accommodating this increase,” Mr. McTeague says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Half of small-business owners in Canada say rising fuel and energy costs are a “major cost constraint that is limiting their ability to grow and be successful,” according to Dan Kelly, the head of the <span class="companylink">Canadian Federation of Independent Business</span> (CFIB), based on a business outlook survey of its members released in May.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Given the other rising costs for businesses across Canada, Mr. Kelly says governments should consider slowing down their planned carbon-tax increases. Ottawa plans to raise the price of carbon to $50 a tonne by 2022, which would add 11.6 cents a litre to the cost of gasoline, while the four largest provinces – Ontario, Quebec, Alberta and British Columbia – have adopted some form of carbon pricing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“There’s not much the provincial or federal government can do about the international oil price, but there is a lot they can do with respect to the tax component,” Mr. Kelly says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At BigSteelBox Corp., a Kelowna, B.C.-based company that provides steel storage and shipping containers at 27 locations from B.C. to Ontario, higher fuel prices have forced it to rethink its delivery routes to reduce time on the road. For instance, in the past, a delivery or pickup would be done at any time, often separately. Now, pickups and deliveries are co-ordinated, says the company’s director of operations, Brian Hawkins.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Hawkins says the company uses diesel to fill up its delivery trucks, and, because they aren’t big enough to buy in bulk, they fill up at gas stations for the same price as other smaller businesses and consumers. “We are feeling the same ebb and flow as the average consumer,” Mr. Hawkins says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He says the company isn’t raising prices to offset the higher fuel costs, “but for sure it’s getting tougher,” with diesel representing about 10 per cent to 15 per cent of overall delivery costs per store, each month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">HelloFresh</span> Canada, a division of the international meal-kit company <span class="companylink">HelloFresh SE</span>, has been dealing with steadily rising fuel prices for its delivery trucks since the business launched in Canada in 2016.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fuel is a “significant component of our logistics costs,” says Ian Brooks, chief executive of HelloFresh Canada. That includes gasoline used in the vehicles that deliver its meal kits to consumers, as well as to pick up the ingredients from local farms and suppliers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To help offset the rising costs of fuel, Mr. Brooks says the company has reduced its packaging and the weight of its meal-kit delivery boxes by a total of about 45 per cent over the past couple of years. That has helped prevent it from increasing its costs to consumers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“When we reduced the size of our box at the beginning of 2018, we were able to work with a logistics partner to avoid an [approximate] 10-per-cent increase in delivery costs, a significant portion of which was driven by rising fuel prices,” he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The company is also set to launch a new fully compostable, plant-based cooling pouch. The lightweight pouches will reduce the need to use heavier ice in the boxes, and so help decrease fuel costs.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Two new reports shed light on why many Canadians have that I-just-can’t-get-ahead feeling.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And why, for some, their financial situation is so precarious.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The first study, from the <span class="companylink">Conference Board of Canada</span>, suggests pay increases will be modest next year, and actually trail inflation in some cases.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The second, by the Financial Planning Standards Council (FPSC), indicates that many of us couldn’t handle an unforeseen expense.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Where compensation is concerned, here’s a <span class="companylink">Conference Board</span> projection of how raises will compare to inflation, on a scale of distressing to bearable. No, the agency didn’t phrase it like that, saying instead that raises will be moderate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Although the economy performed well in the second quarter of 2018, growth will slow over the remainder of the year and into 2019,” the agency said after polling almost 370 employers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“As the economy decelerates, organizations are planning moderate salary increases for 2019.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">How moderate? Here are highlights from the report by research associate Kathryn MacLean and Allison Cowan, director, total rewards, HR and labour relations research.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One: Average raises among non-unionized employees are forecast at 2.6 per cent, compared to the group’s projected inflation of 2.1 per cent, which, in turn, is in line with the <span class="companylink">Bank of Canada</span>’s prediction that inflation will ease to about 2 per cent early next year from 2.7 per cent in the third quarter of this year. Raises this year averaged 2.4 per cent, according to the <span class="companylink">Conference Board</span>, among the slowest in two decades.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Two: The 2019 forecasts break down into 2.7 per cent in the private sector, and 2.2 per cent among public service employees.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Three: The biggest increase, at 3 per cent, will be in the food, beverage and tobacco industry.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Four: When it comes to collective bargaining, the <span class="companylink">Conference Board</span> projects negotiated wage hikes will average 1.6 per cent, the same as in 2018. “Wages remain the key bargaining issue for both management and unions,” the group said, noting that about 340 contracts covering almost 133,000 workers expire next year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Five: Unionized workers in the private sector will average increases of 1.9 per cent, so just about bang on inflation, but those in the public sector will see an average of just 1.2 per cent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There is an impact from all this, of course.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“With employment growth slowing and wage gains expected to be more moderate, gains in household income will be slower than in recent years,” Ms. MacLean and Ms. Cowan said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Higher interest rates will also begin to eat away at disposable income as the share of income going toward debt servicing increases. This means softer growth in consumer spending.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The second survey, done by Leger for the FPSC, shows 33 per cent of Canadians don’t think they could handle a “financial emergency.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That’s highest in Atlantic Canada, at 45 per cent, and lowest in Alberta, at 28 per cent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There was no number constituting an emergency, but the group cited car repairs or veterinarian bills.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To understand Donald Stovel Macdonald, you have to know that he was born and raised in Ottawa amid great players on the national and international stage. In December, 1941, at the age of 9, he walked by himself to Parliament Hill just to get a glimpse of Winston Churchill being bundled into Centre Block to deliver his “some chicken, some neck" speech.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Among the congregation at the church his family attended were two cabinet ministers in the Mackenzie King government, James Lorimer Ilsley and James Layton Ralston. His Sunday school teacher was John Read, who later became the only Canadian ever appointed to a permanent seat on the <span class="companylink">International Court of Justice</span> in The Hague.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Macdonald was the first MP outside Quebec to back Pierre Trudeau for Liberal leader in 1968 and the men became close.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Every time Trudeau had a tough job, he'd turn to Macdonald.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As House leader, Macdonald put through rules still in place today; in Defence, he was unflappable during the FLQ crisis; in Energy, he negotiated made-in-Canada oil pricing with Alberta; and in Finance, he brought in wage and price controls.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Macdonald's contributions continued after he resigned from politics in 1978. In 1985, the Royal Commission he chaired recommended free trade with the United States, a policy embraced by Progressive Conservative prime minister Brian Mulroney. As High Commissioner to Britain from 1988 to 1991, Macdonald left his mark there, too, with a monument to Canada's fallen forces erected across the road from Buckingham Palace.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It was my honour to work twice with Macdonald. In 1985, I wrote Leap of Faith at his request, a slimmed-down version of the two-million-word Royal Commission report that he knew no one would read in full. And, second, I helped with his memoirs, titled Thumper, published in 2014. And let's get the origin of that nickname straight. It wasn't just his size 13 shoes. The nickname was given to him by a U of T fraternity brother who said that the combination of Macdonald's toothy grin and big feet reminded him of Thumper, the rabbit that kept thumping his left foot in Bambi, the <span class="companylink">Disney</span> film.</p>

With three seats each won by the Green and People's Alliance parties, Premier Gallant has opted to try and win the confidence of the legislature, likely by making a deal with members of the smaller parties, instead of stepping down.

</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Both the PCs and the Liberals had sensed the unpopularity of a carbon tax and turned against it in their campaigns. The PCs under Higgs saw what happened in Ontario when PC leader Doug Ford was elected to a huge majority on a popular "scrap the carbon tax" platform. Since Gallant had until then been playing rather nice with the federal Liberals on carbon taxes, Higgs went hard against it, making it a key campaign issue and urging voters to "Stop the Carbon Tax" by voting PC.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Gallant's Liberals also quickly recognized the carbon tax's rising unpopularity among voters and turned themselves into a pretzel by attempting to both please Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, who is demanding provinces tax carbon dioxide emissions, while also shielding consumers from the pain of new tax increases. Their plan? Don't charge a carbon tax, but spend government money on green projects as if they had. To keep energy affordable, Gallant even promised to freeze electricity rates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So by election day, both main parties had publicly abandoned the carbon tax. But then the ballots were counted and suddenly support from the small parties was crucial. Wooing the Green party became the focus of the Liberals'and Tories'quest to form government. The People's Alliance, which is opposed to the carbon tax, has already said it could temporarily support a Tory government, so the battle is on to convince the Greens where to put their support.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Greens have been pushing the idea of a carbon tax for years. And what do you know? Higgs, hoping to make a deal, recently told reporters that his position on carbon taxes happens to be very close to the Green party's, since they both support tackling industrial CO2 emissions without forcing new direct costs on consumers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Would the PCs cut a deal with the Greens to stop the Liberals that ends up imposing the carbon tax that Higgs explicitly ran against? Their track record on tax promises is not encouraging. The PCs vowed in the 2010 provincial election, led by David Alward, to not raise taxes. By 2013, they had broken that commitment. Higgs, then finance minister, increased corporate, tobacco and income tax in the 2013 budget by more than $200 million, New Brunswick's biggest tax hike since 1983.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now Higgs insists that if he becomes premier he'll first fight the carbon tax in court and, if the Trudeau government still forces him to charge a carbon tax, he'll rebate all the revenue back to taxpayers. But that doesn't give much confidence about his Plan A to fight the tax if he's already talking about how he'll respond to defeat. None of the other provincial conservatives fighting against Trudeau's carbon tax - in Ontario, Alberta, Saskatchewan and Manitoba - are conceding defeat to the Liberals.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And last week, after Trudeau unveiled the specifics of his plan to impose a carbon tax on non-compliant provinces, sending rebates to households in those provinces, Higgs sounded even more accommodating, saying he could support the Trudeau government's carbon tax plan if New Brunswick taxpayers "are getting more money than they're taxed."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But that scheme won't work. Firstly, it's impossible to rebate all taxpayers what they've paid into the carbon tax, since everyone pays different amounts based on their lifestyle, which the government can't accurately track (for instance, Ottawa can't know if you heat your home with gas, oil or electricity). Second, history shows those revenues are virtually certain to get gobbled up the next time government needs cash. That's what happened in B.C. when a "revenue neutral" carbon tax inevitably became a new revenue source. And thirdly, while politicians may try rebating taxpayers, there is no discussion about rebates for the small and medium-sized businesses that will also pay the carbon tax.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New Brunswick voters have clearly cast their ballot against any carbon tax. But as politicians vie for power, they may end up getting stuck with a carbon tax anyway. Whoever forms government this week will be laying the groundwork for the next election. If it is Blaine Higgs, voters will remember whether or not he kept his promise to "Stop the Carbon Tax."</p>
