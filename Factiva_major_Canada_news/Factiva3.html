<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">Royal LePage</span> is anticipating 1.2per-cent growth in the national median sales price in 2019, while Re/Max predicts average price gains of 1.7 per cent next year.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While the price increases are modest, they would both be a significant improvement over 2018, which turned out to be a slow year for sales in many major markets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As of the end of October, the number of homes sold nationally was down 10 per cent compared with the first 10 months of 2017, while the average national sales price was down 3.5 per cent over the 10month period, according to the <span class="companylink">Canadian Real Estate Association</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">Royal LePage</span> predicts higher prices in most major markets in 2019. Montreal will lead the country with 3-per-cent price growth next year, followed by Ottawa with 2.5-per-cent price growth, its forecast shows. Prices in the Greater Toronto Area are expected to climb 1.3 per cent, while prices in Greater Vancouver are forecast to remain relatively flat, climbing just 0.6 per cent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">However, prices in Alberta and Saskatchewan are expected to fall in 2019 as oil prices remain low.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">Royal LePage</span> predicts home prices will fall 4.7 per cent in Regina, 2.3 per cent in Calgary and 1.9 per cent in Edmonton.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">Royal LePage</span> chief executive officer Phil Soper said the Canadian housing market will remain in the “correctional cycle" that began in 2018 as sales dropped because of higher interest rates and tougher new mortgage rules.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Markets aren't perfect. They overshoot and then they must correct," Mr. Soper said in a statement.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Re/Max anticipates even greater weakness in Vancouver, predicting a 3-per-cent price drop next year as sales continue to stall in Canada's most expensive city.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Re/Max said foreign-buyer activity is falling in Vancouver, especially in the condo sector, opening up more opportunity for local buyers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But with sales down 30 per cent in 2018, domestic buyers do not appear to be leaping into the market, and prices are expected to fall further next year as demand weakens.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Only Edmonton is expected to see significantly weaker prices than Vancouver, according to Re/ Max, with prices forecast to drop 5 per cent. However, Edmonton's luxury housing market is thriving, with cannabis investors and migrant speculators driving demand for higher-end homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Calgary is expected to be flat next year, while prices in Toronto are expected to climb 2 per cent in 2019, Re/Max said. Condominium sales will fuel Toronto's market as buyers continue to favour the relatively more affordable market segment, Re/Max said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Chris Alexander, regional director for Re/Max in Ontario and Atlantic Canada, said the new mortgage stress-test rules and higher interest rates are hindering buyers, even in traditionally more affordable regions such as Durham, east of Toronto.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“This is particularly true for the first-time buyers and single millennials," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Re/Max predicts the biggest price gains will occur in smaller cities, farther from the major centres.

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Canada's oil-producing provinces are calling for a shakeup in the federal equalization program after the latest figures revealed Quebec's share of the $19.8-billion program will climb to two-thirds as of next year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Quebec gets the boost partly because the total cost of the program increases in line with economic growth, and Ontario will no longer qualify next year, leaving Quebec with a bigger share of the federal transfer program.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Next year's $13.1-billion payment to Quebec – a $1.4-billion increase – will represent 66 per cent of the total equalization program, up from 61.9 per cent when Ontario was still on the receiving end of the federal program, which is intended to help poorer provinces provide similar levels of government services to those found in the rest of the country.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The federal Finance Department released the details of next year's transfer amounts on Sunday evening, just before federal Finance Minister Bill Morneau played host to his provincial and territorial counterparts for dinner in Ottawa. Those meetings concluded on Monday afternoon.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In an interview with The Globe and Mail, Saskatchewan Premier Scott Moe said the results of the current formula are “problematic" and underscore his call for change, which he will bring to the federal government.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I don't think equalization was ever a program that was meant to disburse 66 per cent of its proceeds to one province," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Alberta Finance Minister Joe Ceci and Newfoundland and Labrador Finance Minister Tom Osborne also called for changes to the program on Monday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While the results of the current equalization formula are not sitting well with those provinces, Quebec Premier François Legault caused further irritation last week when he defended Quebec's opposition to the proposed Energy East pipeline that would bring Western Canadian crude through his province for refining in Atlantic Canada.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I'm not ashamed at all of refusing dirty energy while we're offering clean energy at a very competitive price," Mr. Legault said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When asked about the Quebec Premier's remarks, Mr. Ceci told reporters: “He clearly doesn't understand what is happening in the energy sector in Alberta at this point in time."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Saskatchewan's Premier expressed a similar view.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“It's that very energy product – which is sustainable, I might add, among the most sustainable in the world … that is allowing for equalization in its current form to even exist," Mr. Moe said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“So as Canadians, if we support the sharing of our wealth, then we also need to support, together as Canadians, the advancement and the expansion of that wealth."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a budget bill this year, Mr.Morneau renewed for another five years the formula used to calculate how the funds are allocated, even though some provinces had been calling for significant changes. He stood by that decision on Monday as he responded to critics of the program.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Moving on equalization may well be a possibility at the next time we renew it, which will be in four years," he said. Mr. Morneau said there are other programs to help provinces facing short-term challenges, and that equalization is not meant to address such situations. “The way it was intended to work was to ensure that Canadians who move from one province to another can get a roughly equal level of services in different parts of the country."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The equalization program launched in 1957 and was enshrined in the Constitution in 1982. It is based on calculating a national average of fiscal capacity – essentially the ability of governments to raise revenue – and then compensating provinces that fall below that average.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">However, the details of how that average is calculated are a subject of perpetual dispute, especially over whether to include revenue from natural resources and to what degree. Eligible provinces currently receive a payment based on either including 50 per cent of natural resource revenue or exempting them entirely, whichever produces a higher payment. The program had previously included all natural resources revenue.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Alberta's opposition leader, Jason Kenney, has called for natural resource revenue to be removed from the formula, and on Monday repeated his call for a provincial referendum on equalization.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although the payments are an allocation of federal tax revenue, Alberta politicians have complained that their province contributes disproportionately to equalization.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A report this year by the Parliamentary Budget Officer that examined options for reform found that neither a full inclusion nor a full exemption of natural resource revenue would make Alberta an equalization recipient.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Quebec Finance Minister Éric Girard said he wants to bring Quebec's fiscal capacity closer to the national average, which would reduce its share of equalization. However, he also said the fact that Albertans head to the polls in May could be injecting more emotion than necessary into the debate about Quebec's share.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The fact that Alberta will be in an election may be raising the volume on the equalization payments," he said.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There has been a lot of debate recently about whether Canada has a competition problem, with industry using it as a means to argue for tax cuts while our federal government instead focuses on matters deemed to be of greater importance, such as the roll-out of its national carbon tax plan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Unfortunately, one thing that many often forget is that capital is highly mobile and it will tell you a lot about the health of a nation's economic prospects. While the PMO will selectively tout its own stats on the economy - such as low unemployment levels (outside of Alberta of course) - the fact of the matter is the country's corporate environment has simply become unattractive to investors.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For example, according to Brenda LaCerda at Moody's Analytics, net foreign flows of Canadian securities year-to-date have reached a decade low, even lower than the 2008 financial crisis. From 2007 to 2017, foreign direct investment into Canada has collapsed nearly 75 per cent, as per <span class="companylink">Statistics Canada</span>. The OECD FDI Regulatory Restrictiveness Index shows that Canada's policies on foreign investment are nearly 21/2 times more restrictive than the <span class="companylink">OECD</span> country average.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I believe that the root of the problem isn't simply that we are uncompetitive, but that our governments, both past and present, have fostered a culture of entitlement. It is a culture in which everyone demands "our fair share" instead of one that encourages innovation and motivates those that make the most of rules that apply equally to all Canadians.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A great example of this are the recent changes to small-business taxes by the federal government. While the government reduced the tax rate facing small businesses - something that does little to change the disincentive to grow beyond the earnings threshold limit - they also imposed a punitive arm's-length rule on who can receive dividends that completely disregards capital risk. As a result, small businesses have been encouraged to remain stagnant while, based on my conversations with tax experts, we now appear to be the only country in the world with such eligibility rules on dividends.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The problem is that a culture of entitlement cannot compete on the global stage and will continue to seek support whether it be in the form of large corporate tax cuts, a low Canadian dollar, government bailouts based on a company's location, or regulations preventing competition such as in our banking, wireless and airline sectors. Pipelines also don't get built because oil is not "socially acceptable" in certain provinces, even though those provinces are quite happy to receive oil revenues to fund hospitals, schools and daycare programs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As a result we have become a nation of oligopolies happy with the status quo. Unfortunately, as John Chambers puts it in his book Connecting the Dots, "You can't have a revolution while maintaining the status quo, and you can't achieve bold results with incremental change. You can't transform a country, a company, a career, or anything else by tinkering with a few things while sticking to the path you're on."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Consequently, we are missing out on the global innovation revolution being led south of the border with highly competitive companies disrupting the status quo. Simply look at the how successful the FAANG stocks have been and ask why Canada does not have any such companies of our own.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The same applies to other sectors. Take our banking sector, for example, and ask why the same five banks have controlled 90 per cent of the wealth management market for decades whereas the top five U.S. banks currently control only 30 per cent of the corresponding market south of the border. Instead of innovating and growing their market share, our banks have acquired their competition and/or lobbied to change the regulatory rules simply to protect their positions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A great first step toward change is to become anti-entitlement - and that means focusing in on areas that need improvement instead of denying that they even exist. It is an important lesson our government and industries need to learn if we want to once again attract investment capital with the goal of becoming global leaders, instead of simply protecting our fair share.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Speaking ahead of a federalprovincial finance ministers'meeting Monday in Ottawa, Joe Ceci argued Alberta has been reducing the amount of carbon in the oil it produces.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The entire national economy will benefit if Alberta can transport its oil to international markets beyond the United States, he said, insisting pipelines are the safest way to get crude to coastal ports.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ceci's remarks came a few days after Quebec Premier Francois Legault said there's no "social acceptability" for a pipeline that would carry what he called "dirty energy" through his province.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"He clearly doesn't understand what is happening in the energy sector in Alberta at this point in time," Ceci said when asked by reporters Monday about Legault's comment. "We have been innovators in removing carbon from the barrel - we are going to continue to be innovators ... So I don't think the premier of Quebec understands at this point that Alberta's energy sector is leading in terms of the enhancements of the carbon molecule."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ceci later said: "We need to start operating as one country, as opposed to many provinces who are looking out for their own individual interests."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">TransCanada Corp</span>. had proposed a $15.7-billion pipeline called Energy East, to carry western crude through Quebec to New Brunswick for shipment overseas - but the company abandoned the project more than a year ago, citing market changes and red tape.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last Friday after the premiers'meeting in Montreal, New Brunswick Premier Blaine Higgs remained optimistic that, someday, a pipeline would be built to bring western crude oil to ports in his region.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The challenges of moving crude out of the oilpatch to foreign markets has been a major concern for Alberta.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The energy-producing province has been struggling with the economic consequences of an oil-price collapse as well as a deep discount on the price of western Canadian crude caused by transportation constraints.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With a shortage of pipeline capacity, Alberta recently announced it will buy rail cars to ship another 120,000 barrels of oil a day. The province has been seeking help from the federal government, but Ottawa has been reluctant to offer financial support.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ceci said on Monday that he intended to continue urging his federal counterpart, Finance Minister Bill Morneau, to pitch in.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Asked about rail cars on his way into Monday's meeting, Morneau said he believes the most important thing Ottawa can do is focus on long-term solutions such as its purchase of the Trans Mountain pipeline. The goal is to get it expanded and carry more Alberta oil to the British Columbia coast.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The discussion around rail is one that Alberta's brought forward," Morneau said. "We believe that that's something that we should be at least listening to, but we've certainly not gotten in to any conclusions on where the federal government should be."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite Alberta's difficulties, numbers released Sunday show it continues to be a so-called "have" province under the federal equalization program. Equalization is designed to help poorer provincial governments provide public services that are reasonably comparable to those in other provinces.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Under the complex equalization formula, Alberta - as well as B.C., Saskatchewan, Ontario and Newfoundland and Labrador - won't receive equalization payments in 2019-20.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ottawa will transfer $19.8 billion in equalization funds to the provinces and Quebec is set to receive $13.1 billion from that envelope, by far the biggest share. The Quebec economy, however, has been performing well in recent years and its government is predicting a budgetary surplus. Alberta has struggled and is facing several years of deficits.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The formula is based on a three-year moving average of economic growth, so a province's have-or have-not status can lag behind economy-altering events.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Alberta and other "have" provinces have been calling for a review of the equalization program, which was renewed last year for another five-year term.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even with renewal years off, Ceci said there are changes that can be made right away.

</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CALGARY, Alberta, Dec. 10, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- <span class="companylink">Athabasca Oil Corporation</span> (TSX: ATH) (“Athabasca” or the “Company”) is pleased to provide an update on its midstream process, preliminary 2019 capital guidance expectations and its recent reductions in corporate costs.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Strategic Infrastructure Transaction</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Athabasca has entered into an agreement with <span class="companylink">Enbridge Inc</span>. (“<span class="companylink">Enbridge</span>”) for the sale of its Leismer pipelines and Cheecham storage terminal (“Leismer Infrastructure Transaction”). <span class="companylink">Enbridge</span> has been a key partner with Athabasca across its Thermal Oil business unit and the Company looks forward to continuing this long term strategic relationship. The transaction unlocks tremendous value for shareholders while preserving strategic flexibility for the long term development of Athabasca’s high quality Leismer and Corner assets, each of which have regulatory approval for 40,000 bbl/d and a reserve life in excess of 80 years. Key elements of the transaction include:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">* $265 million cash consideration with an annual toll of ~$26 million</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">* Priority service on pipelines and dilbit/diluent tanks; excess volumes receive a discounted toll</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">* Enhanced credit terms with Enbridge across the Thermal Oil business Transaction proceeds are approximately 50% of Athabasca’s market capitalization and will significantly bolster the Company’s liquidity, reduce net debt and improve financial resiliency. Leismer’s cost structure will remain competitive with other top tier oil sands projects with a US$43 WTI operating break-even price (assuming a US$18 WCS differential). Future use of proceeds may include debt reduction, growth initiatives or share buybacks. The transaction is expected to close in Q1 2019.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Athabasca acquired the Leismer and Corner assets in early 2017 for cash consideration of $435 million, 100 million of common shares and contingent value payments triggered at oil prices above US$65 WTI (inflated adjusted). In less than two years, the Company has recovered approximately $500 million of its investment through free cash flow generation, the sale of a contingent bitumen royalty and the transaction proceeds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Athabasca has taken a number of steps to enhance liquidity to ensure financial resiliency. Early in Q4 2018, the Company obtained the release of a $41.5 million letter of credit related to the Trans Mountain Expansion Project and secured a $25 million increase to its letter of credit facilities. Pro forma funding capacity, including enhancements to Enbridge credit terms, is now approximately $525 million (cash and cash equivalents, available credit facilities and Duvernay capital carry).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Athabasca Outlook</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Canadian producers have experienced unprecedented differential and basis spread volatility across light and heavy product streams due to pipeline capacity constraints. This has culminated in Western Canadian Select (“WCS”) heavy differentials trading to peak levels of US$55 in early Q4. Recently, the Alberta Government announced mandatory short term industry production curtailments (“the Industry Curtailments”) starting in January 2019 to alleviate the high differential situation until additional egress is added in 2019. Athabasca is supportive of these actions and views them as a necessary step to rebalance inventories in the near term and provide a bridge to permanent market access initiatives.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Following the Alberta Government’s announcement, the WCS differential outlook has improved significantly. Athabasca expects differentials to moderate in 2019 supported by the Industry Curtailments (325,000 bbl/d), additional crude by rail (currently ~275,000 bbl/d), the start-up of Northwest Refining’s Sturgeon Refinery (80,000 bbl/d) and the Enbridge Line 3 replacement project in H2 2019 (375,000 bbl/d).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Capital Discipline: 2019 Capital & Production Guidance</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Athabasca is implementing a minimum 2019 capital program with a focus on maintaining base production until market fundamentals improve.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">* Preliminary capital guidance of $95 – $110 million</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">* Production guidance range of 37,500 – 40,000 boe/d (88% liquids) In Light Oil, capital expenditures are expected to range between $15 – 30 million net with production guidance between 10,000 – 11,000 boe/d.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Placid Montney is positioned for flexible pad development with no near term land expiries. The Company has minimal activity planned for the balance of the winter and recently rig released a seven well pad. Completion activity on this pad and drilling on the next multi-well pads has been be deferred until the pricing environment improves.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Kaybob Duvernay joint venture has been successful at delineating both the gas condensate and the volatile oil windows. Athabasca’s exposure remains protected by the capital carry to the end of 2019 and the asset is expected to be self-funded during the year. Preliminary expenditures are expected between $200 – 375 million gross ($15 – 30 million net) for a resulting 30% WI. Development will continue in the highest returning areas with an inventory of approximately 1,000 gross wells.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Thermal Oil, capital expenditures are estimated at $80 million with production guidance between 27,500 – 29,000 bbl/d. The Industry Curtailments are not currently included in annual guidance and are expected to be a temporary measure to restore balance in inventories and tighten historically high differentials. Athabasca’s proportional share of the 325,000 bbl/d industry curtailments is estimated at 1,500 – 2,000 bbl/d on a monthly basis through Q1 2019.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At Leismer, the Company has commenced activity on the next five well sustaining pad and associated facilities which are expected to be placed on production in H2 2019. This will be the first sustaining pad drilled at Leismer since the acquisition in 2017. Athabasca has successfully maintained base production through low-cost optimization initiatives. The remainder of the budget relates to operations maintenance and production optimization activities at Leismer and Hangingstone.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Company retains flexibility to accelerate growth projects across its portfolio beyond this base level of activity. Future capital decisions will be evaluated in the context of maintaining financial flexibility, corporate cash flow and external market conditions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Enhancing Competitiveness and Resiliency</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Athabasca has pro-actively undertaken a number of actions to enhance its competitiveness and resiliency:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Netback Optimization</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">* 30% reduction in year-over-year Light Oil operating costs, with Q3 2018 costs of $7.52/boe</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">* 25% reduction in year-over-year Thermal Oil non-energy operating costs, with Leismer and Hangingstone at records lows of $6.69/bbl and at $12.20/bbl in Q3 2018</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">* $20 million reduction in run-rate Leismer diluent costs with the tie-in to Norlite in Q2 2018</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">* Thermal Oil production curtailments in November and December of approximately 8,000 bbl/d Streamlined Corporate Cost Structure</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">* 25% reduction in head office staff effective immediately</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">* Executives and Directors electing a salary rollback of 10% Marketing and Risk Management</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">* Thermal Oil apportionment protection through direct sales to refineries (~40% of 2019 production) and access to leased storage in Edmonton</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">* Thermal Oil hedging: 55% of Q1 2019 at ~US$21 WCS diff and 30% of 2019 at ~US$22 WCS diff Stronger Balance Sheet</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">* $41.5 million release of TMX letter of credit and a $25 million increase in letter of credit facilities</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">* Funding capacity is ~$525 million; term debt in place until 2022 with no maintenance covenants These actions provide the Company with an effective cost structure and improved liquidity. Athabasca is confident it can compete effectively in the North American market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“While we are encouraged by the recent short-term steps taken by the Alberta Government, significant damage has already been done to both the Canadian economy and investor confidence,” said Robert Broen, Athabasca’s President & Chief Executive Officer. “The sector is still a long ways away from permanent solutions. Our governments, both Federally and Provincially, need to prioritize long term projects to ensure access to new end markets and to maximize value for Canada. This environment has forced us to make several challenging decisions to ensure our resiliency as a Company including a 50% reduction in 2019 capital spend and a 25% reduction in our Calgary office staff.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Uniquely positioned, low-decline, oil-weighted producerAthabasca has taken significant steps over the last few years to strategically position the Company with competitive Light Oil and Thermal Oil assets that have exceptional opportunities to generate free cash flow. The Leismer Infrastructure Transaction coupled with a disciplined capital program and enhanced cost structure will allow the Company to remain resilient through a challenging macro environment. The Company’s diverse, low decline and long reserve life portfolio is an advantage during periods of extreme volatility and underpins significant asset value for shareholders. Athabasca offers investors excellent exposure to improving oil prices with low leverage and funds flow sensitivity of $80 million for each incremental US$5/bbl increase in WTI.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in this forward-looking information as a result of the risk factors set forth in the Company’s Annual Information Form (“AIF”) dated March 7, 2018 available on SEDAR at www.sedar.com[http://www.sedar.com], including, but not limited to: fluctuations in commodity prices, foreign exchange and interest rates; political and general economic, market and business conditions in Alberta, Canada, the United States and globally; changes to royalty regimes, environmental risks and hazards; the potential for management estimates and assumptions to be inaccurate; the dependence on Murphy as the operator of the Company’s Duvernay assets; the capital requirements of Athabasca’s projects and the ability to obtain financing; operational and business interruption risks; failure by counterparties to make payments or perform their operational or other obligations to Athabasca in compliance with the terms of contractual arrangements; aboriginal claims; failure to obtain regulatory approvals or maintain compliance with regulatory requirements; uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of reserves and resources; litigation risk; environmental risks and hazards; reliance on third party infrastructure; hedging risks; insurance risks; claims made in respect of Athabasca’s operations, properties or assets; risks related to Athabasca’s amended credit facilities and senior secured notes; and risks related to Athabasca’s common shares.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Oil and Gas Information</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“BOEs" may be misleading, particularly if used in isolation. A BOE conversion ratio of six thousand cubic feet of natural gas to one barrel of oil equivalent (6 Mcf: 1 bbl) is based on an energy equivalency conversion method primarily applicable at the burner tip and does not represent a value equivalency at the wellhead. As the value ratio between natural gas and crude oil based on the current prices of natural gas and crude oil is significantly different from the energy equivalency of 6:1, utilizing a conversion on a 6:1 basis may be misleading as an indication of value.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Drilling Locations</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 1,000 Duvernay drilling locations referenced in this news release include: 64 proved undeveloped or non-producing locations and 35 probable undeveloped locations for a total of 99 undeveloped booked locations with the balance being unbooked locations. The 200 Montney drilling locations referenced include: 84 proved undeveloped locations with the balance being unbooked locations. Proved undeveloped locations and probable undeveloped locations are booked and derived from the Company's most recent independent reserves evaluation as prepared by McDaniel as of December 31, 2017 and account for drilling locations that have associated proved and/or probable reserves, as applicable. Unbooked locations are internal management estimates. Unbooked locations do not have attributed reserves or resources (including contingent or prospective). Unbooked locations have been identified by management as an estimation of Athabasca’s multi-year drilling activities expected to occur over the next two decades based on evaluation of applicable geologic, seismic, engineering, production and reserves information. There is no certainty that the Company will drill all unbooked drilling locations and if drilled there is no certainty that such locations will result in additional oil and gas reserves, resources or production. The drilling locations on which the Company will actually drill wells, including the number and timing thereof is ultimately dependent upon the availability of funding, oil and natural gas prices, provincial fiscal and royalty policies, costs, actual drilling results and additional reservoir information that is obtained and other factors.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Their pain is real – and for patients with mystery illnesses, help is coming from an unexpected source</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The people Allan Abbass and his small team see at QEII Health Sciences Centre in Halifax are some of the most expensive in the health-care system, and often among the longest-suffering, Erin Anderssen writes [https://www.theglobeandmail.com/life/health-and-fitness/article-their-pain-is-real-and-for-patients-with-mystery-illnesses-help-is/] . Research suggests they account for up to half of all visits to family doctors and about 15 per cent of specialist appointments, reporting ailments that are often surprisingly common, such as migraines, lower back pain and upset stomach, but that can’t be traced to a medical cause. As employees, they rack up sick days. Many end up on long-term disability. They are often unfairly suspected of faking. But their pain is real, says Dr. Abbass. It’s just been caused, or made worse, by psychological factors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Abbass, the head of <span class="companylink">Dalhousie University</span>’s Centre for Emotions and Health, treats patients with these unexplained medical symptoms, a phenomenon also known as somatoform disorder, with an innovative form of talk therapy that’s producing impressive results. Called Intensive Short-Term Dynamic Psychotherapy, or ISTDP, the psychological approach deals with unconscious negative emotions – often guilt or anger linked to an emotional trauma suffered years or decades earlier – which have manifested as a physical symptom. Once the devastating event is addressed, the unexplained symptom can disappear or be significantly reduced, Dr. Abbass says, in as many as three-quarters of patients. In some cases, all it takes is a handful of sessions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Kim Hawes is a public servant who returned to work after eight years on disability following 45 sessions with Dr. Abbas. She compares the therapy to “emptying pockets” of emotion one by one, “until they were all gone, and I walked out a free woman.” Following an accidental chemical exposure at work, she developed debilitating sensitivities to certain environments. At one point, she could barely handle leaving her house. Last year, she took the train across the country. She has become a spokesperson for expanding the treatment to more patients. “I thought I would be on disability forever.”</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Morneau met with his provincial counterparts in Ottawa for a Sunday dinner and a daylong session Monday for discussions that included coming enhancements to the Canada Pension Plan and the state of the economy, including a presentation by Bank of Canada Governor Stephen Poloz.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Oil was also on the agenda as Alberta pushed its case for federal funding to buy tanker cars. While the issue of carbon pricing was not, Ontario Finance Minister Vic Fedeli said he still spoke out to register the province's objections to the federal program.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We're very concerned that the federal government continues to push toward a carbon tax ... when the people of Ontario have spoken very loudly,” Fedeli said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The federal carbon pricing program will apply to Ontario in the new year after the newly elected Progressive Conservative government dismantled the province's cap-and-trade program meant to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ahead of the ministerial meeting, the federal finance department publicly confirmed that Ottawa will transfer $78.7 billion to the provinces and territories in 2019-20, including $19.8 billion in equalization payments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The equalization payments will go to five provinces — Prince Edward Island, Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, Manitoba and Quebec, which will collect the lion's share at $13 billion — prompting some of those left out calling for change.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ontario will get $21.3 billion from Ottawa in 2019-20 for health and social programs but no equalization payment, which was $963 million in 2018-19.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fedeli echoed a complaint of past governments at Queen's Park — that Ontario sends Ottawa billions of dollars more in taxes than it gets back in transfers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The federal government should be turning more of that money over to the provinces to cover health care and other issues ... so we see an inequity from the federal government,” Fedeli told reporters after the meeting. “We've asked for a review.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Alberta also wants to see the equalization terms revisited, saying the program has provided no relief in the recent years even as the province suffered the economic shock caused by the sharp drop in oil prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I've raised it every time I come here. We need to see a better deal ... it doesn't work for Alberta,” said Joe Ceci, the province's finance minister.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Morneau was unmoved by the complaints around equalization, saying the program was just renewed and that any chances would have to wait when it next comes up for renewal in four years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We will continue to be open to these discussions, recognizing that as the country changes, we will need to think about whether that approach is working in the way that it was intended,” Morneau said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the federal finance minister stressed that the purpose of equalization transfers was to help ensure an equal level of social and health services across the country, not to provide a buffer against economic shocks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That, he said, was the purpose of the fiscal stabilization program, noting payouts to Alberta and Newfoundland and Labrador in recent years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“These two programs are for different intent,” he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Alberta came away empty-handed in its push to get Ottawa to help pay for rail tanker cars to move oil to market as a stopgap measure in the face of pipeline delays.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ceci sought to sell his counterparts on moving crude by rail, saying he talked about the issue “repeatedly.” He said there was “significantly” more time spent talking about oil and its impact on the Canadian economy at the meeting.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We've decided to step up, buy trains, buy cars and the federal government has a role in deferring those costs for us,” Ceci said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Morneau said that Ottawa is “open” to the discussions but pointedly said that he sees the federal government's purchase of the Trans Mountain pipeline with a plan to expand it as the long-term answer to breaking the bottleneck and getting Alberta oil to markets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We'll continue to discuss with them where we might be able to provide assistance recognizing that the biggest and most important thing we can do is continue to focus on the Trans Mountain pipeline,” Morneau said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He refused to pinned down on whether Ottawa would be prepared to provide funding for the rail car purchases. “We have not come to a conclusion on actions that we may or may not take,” he said.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">OTTAWA — Quebec's finance minister brushed off complaints from Alberta on Monday about his province's share of the federal equalization-funding pie, calling them pre-election posturing in the Prairie province.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Canada's often contentious equalization program has come under fire again after the public learned over the weekend that Alberta, despite dealing with a painful collapse in oil prices, once again failed to qualify to receive payments from Ottawa.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The energy-producing province has been struggling with the economic consequences of a global oil-price drop as well as an extra discount on the price of western Canadian crude caused by transportation constraints.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Opposition politicians in Alberta's legislature and other observers quickly expressed anger that Quebec will see its payment from the $19.8-billion program rise nearly $1.4 billion to $13.1 billion next year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Quebec will receive two-thirds of the entire national envelope, even though its economy has strengthened in recent years and its government is predicting a budgetary surplus.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In comparison, Alberta is facing several years of deficits. Critics charge that equalization is based on a flawed formula.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Equalization does not work for Alberta," said Alberta's Finance Minister Joe Ceci, at a national meeting of finance ministers in Ottawa.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Quebec Finance Minister Eric Girard said protests about his province's equalization share are likely louder than usual because of Alberta's forthcoming provincial election in May 2019.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The fact that Alberta will be in an election may be raising the volume on the equalization payment," Girard said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Girard, part of the newly elected Coalition Avenir Quebec government, said he recognizes and sympathizes with Alberta's difficult situation caused by the recent plunge in oil prices — which has meant cheaper gasoline for consumers but punched holes in Alberta's finances. He said he hopes things will improve for the province.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"For me, it has nothing to do with equalization," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The complex equalization formula is based on a three-year moving average of economic performance, so a province's have- or have-not status can lag behind economy-altering events. It's designed to help poorer provincial governments provide public services that are reasonably comparable to those in other provinces.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Girard also defended Quebec's equalization payment, arguing his province is 20-per-cent less rich than the Canadian average and has the second-highest debt burden after Newfoundland and Labrador. He said Quebec is also home to 23 per cent of Canada's population, but only 19 per cent of the national economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The goal for his government is to improve on all these fronts with the aim of eventually reducing Quebec's dependence on equalization, Girard said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">British Columbia, Saskatchewan, Ontario and Newfoundland will also not get equalization payments in 2019-20. Alberta and other so-called "have" provinces have been calling for a review of the program, which was renewed last year for another five-year term.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Federal Finance Minister Bill Morneau, who hosted Monday's meeting, showed no willingness to re-open the equalization formula until its next renewal. He said the system was renewed after a "robust discussion."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even with renewal years away, Alberta's Ceci said there are changes that can be made right away. For example, Ceci said provinces with strong economies should not receive "floor payments" under equalization, loans that go to provinces that are no longer eligible for equalization payments they had been expecting.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And he pitched for help solving his province's oil-transportation trouble.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ceci said the entire national economy will benefit if Alberta can get its oil to international markets beyond the United States and he insisted pipelines are the safest way to get crude to ocean ports.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">TransCanada Corporation</span> had proposed a $15.7-billion pipeline called Energy East, to carry western crude through Quebec to New Brunswick for shipment overseas — but the company abandoned the project more than a year ago, citing market changes and red tape.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With a shortage of pipeline capacity, Alberta recently announced it will buy rail cars to ship another 120,000 barrels of oil a day. The province has been seeking help from the federal government, but Ottawa has been reluctant to offer financial support.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Following Monday's meeting, Ceci said he repeatedly pressed Morneau to pitch in.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's Christmas, I'm certainly hopeful that there are some things under the tree," Ceci said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Asked about rail cars Monday, Morneau said he believes the most important thing Ottawa can do is focus on long-term solutions such as its purchase of the Trans Mountain pipeline. The goal is to get it expanded and carry more Alberta oil to the B.C. coast.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Environmental Defence and Stand.earth used United Nations climate talks in Poland to release a new report accusing the oil-and-gas industry of undermining Canada's climate plans.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Oil and gas is the major obstacle to Canada actually being a climate leader and not just talking about being a climate leader," said Dale Marshall, national program manager for Environmental Defence.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The report accuses the industry of successfully lobbying Canada to water down climate policies or exempt it from them, including delaying cuts to methane emissions from oil-production facilities and exempting up to 80 per cent of oilsands emissions from the federal carbon price due to kick in next year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Marshall said Canada's policies to allow oilsands production to expand, and even buying the Trans Mountain pipeline to facilitate that expansion, are counterintuitive for a government that keeps claiming it wants to be at the forefront of global climate action.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Patrick McDonald, the director of climate for the Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers, dismissed the report as a "targeted effort by special interest groups looking at only our industry."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">McDonald said the Canadian oil-and-gas industry is the only one in the world subjected to a carbon tax and that it is innovating to reduce emissions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We've been very active and very environmentally responsible," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The report, however, says the emissions from each barrel of oil produced in Canada have grown 20 per cent between 1990 and 2016.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Catherine Abreu, the executive director of Climate Action Network Canada, said at a news conference at the meeting in Poland Monday that even if the industry can use technology to reduce emissions per unit of oil, gas or coal produced, that's just a temporary fix in a world where the long-term plan has to be to stop using fossil fuels entirely.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There are a lot of countries who, like Canada, seem to be under the impression that their fossil fuels are somehow different from everyone else's fossil fuels," she said. "As if their coal, oil or natural gas is magically non-emitting and actually good for the climate, while everyone else's fossil fuels are the problem."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Paris agreement, the operative pact meant to head off the worst of climate change, committed the nations of the world to cutting emissions and the amount of carbon pollution trapped in the atmosphere enough to keep the average global temperature from rising no more than 2 C compared to pre-industrial times. They're supposed to try to keep the temperature increase as close to 1.5 C as possible.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The difference between the two is significant, with millions more people displaced at 2 C due to rising sea levels, extreme temperatures, and severe storms, as well as serious impacts on the world's food supply and greater spread of disease, according to the <span class="companylink">UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Right now the world's policies have it on track to exceed 3 C in warming by the end of the century.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Canada is currently planning to trim its emissions by about 200 million tonnes a year — the equivalent to what is produced by about 44 million passenger cars — but a recent <span class="companylink">UN</span> report from dozens of respected climate scientists said that if the 1.5 C target has any hope of being met, Canada's share of the necessary emissions reductions would be more like 400 million tonnes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The oil-and-gas sector is one of the few areas where emissions are still increasing in Canada. Tzeporah Berman, international programs director at Stand.earth, said if oil-sector emissions keep growing, Canada will have to "squeeze" every other province and industry to get them to cut even more. Since most of the existing plan addresses the easiest and cheapest reductions we can get, cutting those other sectors further would require more costly and difficult regulations and policies, she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Alberta government is looking at capping oilsands emissions at 100 million tonnes a year as part of its climate plan, with a view to expanding production as technology advances to reduce the emissions from each barrel of oil produced. But no such policy has yet been implemented.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Canada’s largest banks are brushing off the recent crash in domestic-crude prices, confident that their loan books are in solid shape.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Collectively, the Big Six banks reported $45-billion in annual profits for fiscal 2018, which ended on Oct 31. Yet on recent conference calls to discuss their fourth-quarter earnings, analysts pressed executives for details about their loan exposures to oil and gas companies, worried that a crisis could be brewing behind the scenes, resulting in large write-downs.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">All six banks responded in the same fashion: This is not 2016. There was barely a crisis for them then, and there definitely isn’t one now.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Since 2015 and 2016, we’ve ‘up-tiered’ the companies we deal with,” Dieter Jentsch, head of global banking and markets at <span class="companylink">Bank of Nova Scotia</span>, said on a conference call. “And I have to say to you that the balance sheets that we see in the business have never been as strong, and the management teams are very cost-conscious.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When the global price of crude plummeted below US$30 per barrel in early February, 2016, some analysts and investors worried. At the time, about 80 per cent of <span class="companylink">Royal Bank of Canada</span>’s outstanding energy loans were made to non-investment-grade companies, while <span class="companylink">National Bank of Canada</span> had large loan exposures to junior oil and gas companies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ultimately, the banks emerged relatively unscathed. But to be safe, a number have taken steps to protect themselves. National Bank chief risk officer Bill Bonnell said on a conference call that the bank’s oil and gas loan portfolio has been “meaningfully rebalanced since 2015,” adding that its outstanding loans in the energy sector “have been brought down significantly.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As a percentage of its total loan portfolio, <span class="companylink">National Bank</span> has cut its energy exposure in half over the past three years. Oil and gas now makes up 1.7 per cent of its total loan book, down from 3.6 per cent at the peak in 2015.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Canada’s banks have not cut ties with energy companies en masse. In fact, total loan exposure to the sector across the Big Six hit $47-billion at the end of fiscal 2018, up 4.8 per cent from $44.9-billion three years prior.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That statistic might raise concerns among bank investors because crude prices are volatile again. In October, Western Canadian Select, a benchmark for Alberta heavy oil, sold at a discount to West Texas intermediate oil of some US$50 - more than double the historical average. (That discount had shrunk to only US$15 on Friday after Alberta Premier Rachel Notley enforced production cuts on the province’s oil sands producers.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Canada’s banks are not fazed. And outsiders appreciate why.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To start, the energy sector isn’t in need of as much debt. “There’s generally less investment going on in the oil patch,” David Beattie, credit analyst at Moody’s Investors Service, said in an interview. Just last week, oil sands giant <span class="companylink">Canadian Natural Resources</span> cut its 2019 capital spending by $1-billion to $3.7-billion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Energy loans as a percentage of the Big Six banks’ total portfolios have fallen over three years. Oil and gas lending has climbed 4.7 per cent, but total lending has jumped 22.5 per cent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Canada’s banks have also cut their exposures to riskier junior oil and gas companies. <span class="companylink">National Bank</span>’s Mr. Bonnell said on a conference call that its energy relationships "have been refocused on larger, well-capitalized oil and gas producers and deepened with large investment-grade pipeline clients,”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But rivals have, too, and often it happened simply because smaller producers have been disappearing. “There’s been a number of mergers and takeovers, and a number of companies have just gone under,” Raymond James energy analyst Jeremy McCrea said in an interview.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since the start of 2015, 160 North American energy companies have filed for bankruptcy, according to <span class="companylink">Haynes and Boone</span> LLP. Of these, 18 were Canadian, the largest of which was <span class="companylink">Endurance Energy Ltd</span>., which had US$475-million in debt.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Market dynamics have played a role too, diverting loans away from riskier junior companies. Many junior energy companies were financed through reserve-based lending, and under this model, banks use a company’s oil and gas reserves as collateral.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“As oil prices (especially WCS) have declined, the value of the reserves decreased, as did the size of the bank lines [of credit]," Ravikanth Rai, a credit analyst at <span class="companylink">DBRS Ltd</span>., wrote in an e-mail. “This forced the companies to deleverage as opposed to the banks having an active strategy to reduce exposure to the sector.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And then there is the recent move in WCS prices, which narrowed the discount to WTI.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The banks, of course, are not completely out of the woods. Energy prices are inherently volatile, and trade tensions between the United States and China are rising, hurting the global economic outlook.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the odds are in the banks' favour. Since the 2008 global financial crisis they have continually added capital cushions to absorb loan losses, and those levels today are the highest they have ever been.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Their exposure to the sector has also fallen dramatically over three decades. When energy prices plummeted in the late 1980s, oil and gas producers made up 7 per cent of total bank loans. By 2016, they were 2 per cent of the collective portfolio. Today, they are 1.7 per cent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Though the market never believes the banks when they say their exposures are manageable, the numbers clearly demonstrate that the sector has become more adept at credit risk management over time," Scotiabank financial services analyst Sumit Malhotra wrote in an e-mail.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Alberta's oil-production curtailment plan has largely accomplished its mission — even before it has gone into effect.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since Canada's top oil-producing province announced mandatory output curbs on Dec. 2, the spot price of Western Canada Select crude has surged more than 70 per cent. The grade's discount to the U.S. benchmark has been chopped in half to around $13 (U.S.) a barrel, the narrowest in more than a year. Other blends, including Edmonton Mixed Sweet and Syncrude, also are surging.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Oil producers are saying the 8-day-old plan will bring “significant relief” to the province's pipeline congestion problem, and it's even being credited with preventing layoffs for at least one major oil-sands company. The 325,000-barrel-a-day supply cut takes effect next month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“It's working — the proof is in the price,” said Tim Pickering, chief investment officer of Auspice Capital Advisors Ltd. in Calgary. “The amount of the curtailment was enough to make a measurable difference in the glut that we have.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The plan announced by Alberta Premier Rachel Notley probably has encouraged producers to start dialing back output because they know they can do so without putting themselves at a disadvantage to rivals, Pickering said. As oil suppliers and refiners negotiate sales for the months ahead, the Western Canadian discount may continue tightening into March, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, uncertainty abounds. Before the production cuts were announced, companies had started to slash dividends and delay 2019 drilling plans, and it may take more than a week of stronger prices for them to reverse those moves.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Layoffs Avoided</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The first signals may come this week as explorers announce 2019 budgets. Capital spending among Canada's explorers and producers may increase 5 per cent in 2019, trailing the 10 percent growth in the U.S., according to a survey conducted by Evercore ISI.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite the survey's results, Evercore analysts led by James West doubt Canadian capital spending will live up to the optimism expressed by executives in the survey. <span class="companylink">Canadian Natural Resources Ltd</span>. last week pegged its 2019 plan at C$3.7 billion, or about C$1 billion less than normal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For other companies, the provincial output caps may have staved off drastic cuts. MEG Energy Corp. Chief Executive Officer Derek Evans said last week that the curtailment prevented the company from laying off workers and trying to “absolutely minimize” capital spending.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are worries about longer term effects as well. The plan has stirred concerns that the government intervention adds another layer of risk for investors and weakens the relative value of companies like <span class="companylink">Suncor Energy Inc</span>., whose significant refining capabilities had helped it better weather the price downturn, according to Randy Ollenberger, an analyst at Bank of Montreal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The mixed sentiment is reflected in the muted response in Canadian energy shares since the curtailment announcement. The S&P/TSX Energy Index has slid about 3 per cent since the policy was introduced, a period coinciding with a global market meltdown that also includes a roughly 3.3 per cent drop for the broader S&P/TSX index.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The Alberta intervention works over the short term,” Sandy Fielden, an analyst at Morningstar Inc., said in a note Monday. “A greater concern arises if Alberta doesn't quickly remove the constraints when new pipelines come on line and becomes used to leaning on this crutch in support of higher prices longer term.”</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">* Housing starts stronger than expected</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These are ugly days on global stock markets, leaving investors wondering if the seasonal strength that usually arrives this time of year will ever make an appearance.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The S&P 500 tumbled by more than 4.5 per cent last week, the <span class="companylink">Nasdaq</span> almost 5 per cent, and the S&P/TSX Composite Index by about 2.5 per cent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A chart pattern tracked by technical analysts and traders isn’t sending an encouraging sign. What is known as a death cross formed in the S&P 500 Friday for the first time since January 2016.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A death cross forms when an index’s near-term moving average of daily closing prices falls below its long-term moving average as both averages are declining. The 50- and 200-day moving averages are commonly used.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The S&P 500′s 50-day moving average is now 3.7 points below its declining 200-day moving average. The benchmark index is now down 10.16 per cent from its record close on Sept. 20.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Historically, the death cross has indicated a further fall for the index after the pattern emerges.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But that’s no guarantee. Here then are some of the latest views of the market’s prospects:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Luc Vallée, chief strategist, <span class="companylink">Laurentian Bank Securities</span>
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We have been asked recently if we expect a Santa Claus end-of-year rally. We don’t. Not that it is impossible for the markets to regain some of the significant losses of recent days but we are skeptical about their ability to bounce back strongly and achieve new highs by the time 2019 arrives ... Because the selloff comes against a generally good Q3 earnings season, we believe that this might be a good entry point for equity. Depending on the probabilities one assigns to central banks making a policy mistake by raising rates too quickly and a full-fledged trade war developing over the course of 2019, the outlook on the relative value of equities versus bonds might vary greatly. Equity valuations are only attractive if the U.S.-China trade war gets resolved and reasonable only if negotiations drag on. If, on the contrary, President Trump decides to impose 25-per-cent tariffs on March 1 on all Chinese imports, and China fully retaliates soon after, equities are still unattractive at the current levels."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">Bank of America Merrill Lynch</span> research team</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The BofA Merrill Lynch research team is bearish stocks, bonds, and the U.S. dollar; bullish cash and commodities; and long on volatility. We expect to turn tactically risk-on in late spring, but to start 2019 with a bearish asset allocation of 50 per cent stocks, 25 per cent bonds and 25 per cent cash ... Earnings growth also is likely to slow in the U.S., though the near-term outlook remains somewhat positive. The [S&P 500] is expected to peak at or slightly above 3,000 before settling in at a year-end target of 2,900 ... Our U.S. equity strategists are overweight health care, technology, utilities, financials and industrials, and underweight consumer discretionary, communication services and real estate."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Brian Belski, chief investment strategist, <span class="companylink">BMO</span>
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Based on TSX valuations and our client interactions, the overwhelmingly negative mantra, emotion, and sentiment that have smothered Canadian stock market performance throughout 2018 remain firmly in place. Investors do not really believe that the broader TSX is actually displaying improving, if not outright strong, fundamental metrics in terms of earnings growth, valuation, and operating performance. Instead, it seems that most Canadian-centric investors we speak with are resigned to wait for the perfect ‘trigger’ that will represent the buy signal ... We believe the steep discount of Canadian equities provides investors with an attractive entry point given our broadly bullish outlook. Our models indicate that the S&P/TSX index will achieve a year-end 2019 index target of 18,000 on earnings per share of $1,100. This represents an 18.5-per-cent gain from the November close.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Marko Kolanovic, global head of quantitative and derivatives strategy, and Bram Kaplan, <span class="companylink">JPMorgan Chase</span>
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We base our market outlook on the view that the business cycle will not end in 2019 ... The most recent (Q3) U.S. earnings season demonstrated the highest [earnings per share] growth, and second highest revenue growth, since 2010. Another reason why we don’t think the cycle end is close is because we think fiscal measures will supplement or replace monetary policies, not just in the U.S. but around the world ... For these reasons, we are still overweight equities and underweight bonds. For 2019, we forecast continued EPS growth at a rate of ~8 per cent and a price target of 3,100 on the S&P 500. Positive GDP and earnings are “reality,” which is currently starkly disconnected from equity sentiment, valuation, and positioning."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Oliver Jones, markets economist, Capital Economics</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We think that [last] week’s turbulence provides a reasonable guide to the trends to watch for in markets next year. In particular, while both the S&P 500 and <span class="companylink">U.S. Treasury</span> yields have started to drop a little sooner than we had previously anticipated, we still suspect that both have much further to fall in 2019 ... Markets are forward-looking, and the broad-based nature of the decline in the S&P 500, as well as the flattening of the Treasury yield curve, point to worries about the prospects for the economy, which we think will get worse in 2019 as growth does indeed falter ... . On top of that, signs that growth in the rest of the world is already looking a little shaky can’t have helped. In our view, it is likely to weaken further in many countries next year, most notably in China ... Taking that all into account, we think that the U.S. stock market will fall further next year, perhaps to about 2,500, from closer to 2,700 now.”</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Oil prices slip</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Oil prices are slipping today, kicking off a new week after an eventful past several days.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To recap, Alberta Premier Rachel Notley ordered a production cut of 325,000 barrels a day among provincial producers, starting next year. That played out over several days, boosting Western Canadian prices, with <span class="companylink">OPEC</span> and its oil allies capping last week with a supply cut of 1.2 million barrels a day.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Will the decision by the cartel and its allies, a group known as OPEC+, work?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We had suggested a cut of 1.5 million barrels per day was necessary,” said Joan Pinto, associate, energy specialist at CIBC World Markets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“If U.S. production growth stays on the same trajectory as flagged by the agencies given their ongoing de-bottlenecking and if demand falters into extended trade war uncertainty, [Friday’s] 1.2 million barrels per day of a cut may actually not prove sufficient to get oil prices to soar, as has been the experience in Canada, but inch higher.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As for the sector, added Toronto-Dominion Bank senior economist Fotios Raptis, “the woes of Canadian oil producers are now widely known, and this agreement, together with Albertan production cuts announced earlier [last] week, should alleviate some pressure on industry margins.”</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What to watch for this week</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We owe a lot, and we're saving less than we thought.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So Friday's report on household debt will be telling.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Canadians are carrying a hefty debt burden, measured by the ratio of household credit to disposable income. That stood at 169.1 per cent in the second quarter, which means we owe $1.69 for each dollar we have to spend.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Credit growth, however, has been slowing amid new mortgage-qualification rules and rising interest rates. At the same time, though, income gains have lagged, which also factors into this <span class="companylink">Statistics Canada</span> report for the third quarter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">BMO</span>’s Benjamin Reitzes believes the key measure “was likely flat to slightly lower in Q3, as slowing debt growth was offset by softening income gains.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That would be a good sign, welcomed by policy makers who have worked hard to head off a debt bubble.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Note that debt ratios have risen in nearly every Q3 on record (except 1990), so a flat to down reading would be a good result," said Mr. Reitzes, <span class="companylink">BMO</span>'s Canadian rates and macro strategist.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Still, with interest rates pushing higher, look for the debt ratio to trend lower over the next couple of quarters assuming income growth holds up."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Friday's report also looks at wealth, measured by assets and the ratio of net worth to disposable income. The latter has been "relatively flat" since the first quarter of last year, Mr. Reitzes said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Over all, Canadian balance sheets are in decent shape, even if debt ratios remain near record highs."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But let's look at what we're saving, given that <span class="companylink">Statistics Canada</span> recently revised down those numbers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The sharp downward revisions to the saving rate imply that households are even more vulnerable to higher interest rate than we had previously thought,” said Stephen Brown, senior Canada economist at Capital Economics, though he noted that the third-quarter pace of just 0.8 per cent “somewhat overstates the short-term vulnerability of households' finances” because of how it’s calculated.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This all threatens to ripple through the economy, warned Katherine Judge and Royce Mendes of CIBC World Markets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Earlier numbers indicated that, even while juggling bloated debts, at least "Canadians were stashing away more of their incomes in savings," Ms. Judge and Mr. Mendes said in a report, which meant we had some "extra room" to spend more.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But that has now been revised away.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"With higher interest rates more of a headwind to heavily indebted households north of the border, the lower savings rate is another reason to believe Canadian retailers will face a more challenging environment than those in the U.S.," Ms. Judge and Mr. Mendes said.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Here's what else to watch for this week:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MONDAY</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We'll get two readings of the country's real estate market, one from <span class="companylink">Canada Mortgage and Housing Corp</span>., the other from <span class="companylink">Statistics Canada</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists expect the CMHC report to show housing starts slipped in November to an annual pace just shy of 200,000 from October's 206,000. The second report is forecast to show building permits fell in October, by 0.5 per cent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Following a strong 2017, homebuilders are feeling the pinch of higher interest rates and tighter lending standards," said CIBC's Mr. Mendes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It’s likely that November was another softer month for overall housing starts, but keep an eye on the details, too," he added.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Homebuilding has shifted away from single-family starts and toward multiples. With each single-family start adding more to GDP than each multiple start, the headline slowdown in starts has actually masked the scale of the impact for the economy.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At some point this week, Chinese leaders are also expected to hold their yearly Central Economic Work Conference.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The communique released after the gathering may provide hints to the direction of policy over the coming quarters," said Chang Liu of <span class="companylink">Capital Economics</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There are already signs that officials are planning to step up policy support."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">TUESDAY</p>

</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WEDNESDAY</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A report on inflation, key to the interest rate deliberations of the <span class="companylink">Federal Reserve</span>, is expected to show a decline in the annual rate to 2.2 per cent in November from October's 2.5 per cent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That drop will be "largely on the oil price rout, which left gasoline prices down nearly 8 per cent, month over month," TD economists said in a forecast.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">THURSDAY</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">European Central Bank</span> won't change its key rate, but today's meeting is key for three reasons, noted <span class="companylink">BMO</span>'s Ms. Lee:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">1: The <span class="companylink">ECB</span> will release forecasts for GDP and inflation, and “we will likely see downward revisions to both, given weaker economic data and the plunge in energy prices.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">2: The central bank is expected to “stick to its guns and definitively state” that its quantitative easing asset-buying program will end this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">3: The central bank will update its outlook for interest rates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"With markets increasingly fixated on when the <span class="companylink">ECB</span> is likely to start looking at raising rates, it is looking increasingly unlikely that the guidance that rates may have to rise in Q4 next year is in any way credible given the slowdowns being seen across Europe, as well as the civil unrest in France, which appears to show that consumers are struggling," said CMC Markets chief analyst Michael Hewson.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We could well see the <span class="companylink">ECB</span>’s guidance about the path of rates adjusted to reflect the change in the economic outlook across Europe, as well as the rest of the world.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are also some notable quarterly results on tap, including <span class="companylink">Costco Wholesale Corp</span>, <span class="companylink">Empire Co</span>., <span class="companylink">Transat AT Inc</span>. and <span class="companylink">Transcontinental Inc</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">FRIDAY</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists expect to see that retail sales in the U.S. rose 0.1 or 0.2 per cent in November.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Headline retail sales surged in October, but the bulk of that strength likely reversed in November, owing to the nosedive in gas prices and softer auto sales,” said CIBC’s Ms. Judge.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Environment and Climate Change Minister Catherine McKenna landed in Poland on Sunday with the goal of speeding up the global transition to a low-carbon global economy, while at home the federal government faces growing provincial opposition that will make it harder to achieve Canada’s own climate change targets.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the annual United Nations climate change summit, Ms. McKenna and her international colleagues are trying to finalize the operating rules of the Paris agreement, the 2015 treaty in which 195 countries pledged to work to avert the most catastrophic impacts of climate change.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Under the accord, Canada has committed to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 30 per cent below 2005 levels by 2030. In an interview before leaving for Paris, Ms. McKenna indicated the country will increase that ambition, though Ottawa’s most recent assessment suggests current policies will leave the country some 66-megatonnes above the 517-megatonne target in 2030.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, the political climate has gotten a lot hotter since 2015, both in Canada and internationally.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. President Donald Trump is encouraging fossil-fuel production and use and gutting existing climate policies, while French President Emmanuel Macron was forced last week to roll back a hike in fuel taxes after it sparked violent protests. On Sunday, major oil-exporting countries prevented the summit from “welcoming” a recent report from the <span class="companylink">Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) </span>that warned of drastic consequences if the world does not limit the global average temperature increase to 1.5 C.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In an interview in her Parliament Hill office, Ms. McKenna said French protests holds a clear lesson for governments as they adopt carbon pricing and other measures designed to reduce fossil-fuel consumption by encouraging conservation and the use of low-carbon energy sources.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“What it does is emphasize that when you develop policies you need to make sure you are also considering people and that life is affordable,” the minister said. She noted the federal carbon tax – which will apply in Ontario, Saskatchewan, Manitoba and New Brunswick, four provinces that do not have their own broad-based levy – will return 90 per cent of revenue raised to households in those provinces.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At home, Ontario, Manitoba and New Brunswick have killed carbon-pricing plans that were in place in the former case or were being planned by the latter two provinces. Alberta has cancelled future increases in its carbon tax over the failure to complete oil sands pipelines that would open new markets and increase prices for western Canadian crude. Alberta’s United Progressive Conservative Party Leader Jason Kenney – who is leading in polls heading into a spring election – vows to end that province’s carbon tax and the emission-reductions plans it funds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even as some provinces backtrack, Ms. McKenna is promising to increase the country’s ambition for emission cuts in 2020, as called for under the Paris agreement.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The Paris agreement provides for ratcheting up ambition,” she said. “This is a conversation we need to have. We’re all in this together.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Environmental groups who were in Poland last week applauded when Ms. McKenna said Canada would increase its ambition, though it is not clear how the country will meet its existing commitments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Environment Minister likes to focus on the economic opportunities in the global adoption of low-carbon technology. She acknowledges, however, the transition is difficult for Alberta and indeed for Canada with its large resource sector.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Alberta, the failure to get new pipelines constructed has deepened opposition to climate policies that would impose any cost on industry or households. Labelling the Paris accord a “futility,” former Alberta treasurer Ted Morton wrote in The Globe and Mail last week that Canada must essentially match the United States’s environmental policies or risk losing investment to its southern neighbour.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The rising opposition to the Paris deal increases the stakes for Ms. McKenna and her international colleagues this week in Poland.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Their aim is to deliver a workable, credible set of rules and procedures under which countries will work together to achieve the goal of limiting the average increase in global temperatures to well below 2 C. Even that amount of warming will cause major threats to the environment, to vulnerable species and to the health and well-being of millions, perhaps billions, of people, the IPCC warned.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Among the most contentious issues is whether emerging powers such as China, India and South Africa must meet the same standards for transparency and accountability in their climate plans as developed countries, and how to build a global market that would allow for trading in greenhouse-gas credits while ensuring the emissions reductions that they represent are real.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On the sidelines of the negotiations, Ms. McKenna will work with her British counterpart, Claire Perry, on an international effort to phase out coal-fired electricity or ensure such plants capture the carbon dioxide they would emit into the atmosphere.</p>

China has, of course, demanded the return of the high-profile Wanzhou. But Beijing expects Canada to extradite Wanzhou to America, as the U.S. demands, and it will understand Canada's need to honour Canada-U.S. extradition treaties. The reality is that Canada, pretty much alone, has been an enthusiastic enabler of <span class="companylink">Huawei</span> in its audacious bid to gain world leadership in fifth-generation mobile technology (5G) that could be 100 times faster than existing technologies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">Huawei</span> is a long-suspected leader in Chinese intellectual property theft, and has been treated with hostility in the U.S., Europe and Australasia. By sharp contrast, Canada has embraced <span class="companylink">Huawei</span>, one of Canada's biggest R&D spenders. Huawei counts telecom giant <span class="companylink">Telus Corp</span>. among its many Canadian clients, and has partnered with at least 10 Canadian universities on research projects, including the <span class="companylink">University of Waterloo</span>, the Stanford of Canada.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That and <span class="companylink">Huawei</span>'s sizable Canadian cultural sponsorships have earned it a reputation for good corporate citizenship, in a Canada whose private-sector R&D spending is shamefully low.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">All to say, Chinese media bluster about Wanzhou's fate disguises Beijing's appreciation of Canada's warm welcome for a flagship Chinese enterprise. China won't let a diplomatic dispute over Meng affect trade relations between itself and Canada.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A troubled Alberta needs to look itself in the mirror</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Eventually, someone will have to tell Alberta to look in the mirror before continuing to blame Ottawa for its oilpatch crisis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Over the past decade, Alberta producers massively increased their output, knowing there was no way to get it to market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That was a bad bet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It accounts for the near-record gap between the price for Alberta's landlocked bitumen and lighter grades like West Texas Intermediate (WTI). Neither is Ottawa to blame for Alberta's failure to diversify away from fossil fuels, ignoring then-Alberta premier Peter Lougheed wise counsel to do so back in the 1970s.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And Ottawa is blameless in Edmonton's repeated raiding of its oil-royalty piggy bank, the <span class="companylink">Alberta Heritage Savings Trust Fund</span>, also created by Lougheed, to soften the blow of crises like this one.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Norway's oil-royalty fund tops $1 trillion (U.S.) in assets. The Heritage Fund has a pathetic $17.4 billion (Canadian) in assets[https://open.alberta.ca/dataset/3675e470-646e-4f8a-86a7-c36c6f45471a/resource/1f86ad5d-923c-47d0-816a-063fd6cacbf4/download/2017-18-heritage-fund-annual-report.pdf], meaning an Alberta bailout, if it comes to that, will have to be financed by all Canadians.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ottawa has doted on the oilpatch. Both the Harper and Trudeau governments have tried to increase crude-oil pipeline capacity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet many Albertans are angry that Ottawa has not challenged a court decision blocking completion of the Trans Mountain pipeline expansion, instead abiding by the court's demand that the project be halted until B.C. coastal residents are better protected from oil spills and that Indigenous peoples in the region are properly consulted.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There comes a point when we can no longer allow the Alberta oilpatch to hold hostage world-class environment standards and living conditions for Alberta's fellow Canadians, to say nothing of Athabasca's enormous complicity in global warming.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When Canada had a friend in the White House</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The astonishing resume of George H.W. Bush, who died last week at age 94, does not mention, in any official way, at least, that Bush was one of Canada's greatest friends among American presidents.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Bush presidential record points to better times ahead, when American voters, as they so recently did in giving Barack Obama back-to-back electoral majorities, will soon again chose a person of dignity, sagacity and common sense to lead them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As America's 41st president, and in partnership with then-Canadian PM Brian Mulroney, Bush put an end to the acid rain that was destroying Central Canada's lakes and waterways. Bush's Clean Air Act was a bold rebuke to Corporate America, chiefly its politically powerful electric utilities. Bush ended the impunity with which that sector was poisoning with its emissions the fresh water supplies of the continent, mostly in Canada.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And in partnership with then Canadian PM Jean Chr&#233;tien,Bush invited Mexico into what was to be the world's biggest free-trade zone, transforming the U.S.-Canada Free Trade Agreement (FTA) into the <span class="companylink">North American Free Trade Agreement</span> (<span class="companylink">NAFTA</span>).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">NAFTA</span> that Donald Trump, the current U.S. chief executive, has long decried as a “disaster” for America has roughly quadrupled trade among the three countries. And a Mexican manufacturing sector whose immense growth was triggered by <span class="companylink">NAFTA</span> gave North America a low-cost workshop to match the role played by Spain and the Czech Republic in Europe, and by Vietnam and Malaysia for Japan, reversing a North American slide in global competitiveness.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In his youth, Bush was a remarkable ballplayer with major-league promise. In his dealings with Canada, he came close to pitching a perfect game.</p>

China also summoned the Canadian ambassador to China, with Beijing’s Vice-Foreign Minister calling the arrest “an act committed by Canada.” China appears to be taking a much stronger tone against Ottawa than Washington, despite the fact that U.S. officials requested Meng’s extradition over accusations she committed fraud in misleading an investigation into the sale of U.S. technology to Iran. A desire to keep trade tensions at bay could account for discrepancy, observers say.</p>

A simple majority in the 650-seat House of Commons is needed, and about 100 members of May’s 315-seat strong Conservative Party have already voiced opposition to the deal. A key point of contention is a backstop that would see the U.K. remain part of the <span class="companylink">EU</span> customs while new trade deals are negotiated, something critics say keeps the two sides too closely aligned. May is warning of “grave uncertainty” and “uncharted waters” if the deal fails to pass. In practical terms, this could result in an election being called.</p>

Alberta, Saskatchewan and Newfoundland and Labrador continue to be left out despite running budget deficits amid an energy-sector downturn. But Finance Minister Bill Morneau has resisted calls to change the system and earlier this year locked in existing rules for five years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The payments are often a point of tension between “have” and “have not” provinces; Manitoba, New Brunswick, Nova Scotia and P.E.I. will also receive funds next year. Quebec’s Finance Minister said his province’s share is rising in part because the formula accounts for population, and Quebec is home to 22 per cent of the country.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For more than 100 years, photographers and photo librarians working for The Globe and Mail preserved an extraordinary collection of 20th-century news photography. Every Monday, The Globe features one of these images. In December, we’re focusing on the holidays.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 1962, Globe and Mail photographer Harold Robinson found a great spot to capture the frenzy of last-minute Christmas Eve shoppers at Toronto’s renowned bargain house, Honest Ed’s. (For many years, the scene would have been no less wild at the store’s annual Christmas turkey giveaway.) Known for its corny slogans (“Only the floors are crooked!”) and, later, the 30-foot-tall by 60-foot-wide marquee sign, lit with 23,000 bulbs, the store was as flashy as its owner, Ed Mirvish, was humble. He and his wife, Anne, began with a small clothing store in 1943, and worked their way up to 1.8 hectares at Bloor and Bathurst streets. As the retail landscape changed and the store’s fortunes fell, the family sold the land to a luxury-property developer and Honest Ed’s closed for good in 2016. Looking for bargains in Toronto has never been the same since. – Dianne Nice</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lori Turnbull is director of the School of Public Administration at Dalhousie University, deputy editor of Canadian Government Executive, and fellow at the Public Policy Forum.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">First ministers’ meetings are often criticized for being more about strategy than substance, but strategy is important – particularly given the proximity of the next federal election. The alliances and tensions emerging from Friday’s meeting could play a significant role in defining the narrative of the 2019 campaign and, therefore, could have an impact on the future of the Trudeau government.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prime Minister Stephen Harper’s strategy was to avoid these kinds of meetings. On the one hand, this approach arguably worked well for him and was consistent with his vision for how the country should be governed. Mr. Harper favoured an open approach to federalism that emphasized respect for provincial autonomy in matters of their own jurisdiction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There was little need for Mr. Harper to meet with his provincial counterparts; he let them run their own ships. On the other hand, it could be argued that the lack of federal-provincial engagement allowed for an abdication of federal leadership on matters that would require central co-ordination in a country as large and complex as Canada, such as environmental protection, economic growth, and reconciliation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, meetings with the premiers are mandatory. Refusing or neglecting to do so would be inexplicably against brand and would undermine his government’s policy goals. Mr. Trudeau has positioned himself as a gregarious extrovert who likes to communicate and collaborate. Consistency with this image forces him to sit down with the premiers on the issues facing the country and to smile for the cameras whenever he does.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many aspects of Mr. Trudeau’s policy agenda require provincial buy-in. In pursuing his plans and visions for the country, he colours outside the lines of our constitution. He would be hard-pressed to “grow the middle class” without the provinces, given their constitutional responsibility for things like health, education and natural resources, as well as the reality of shared responsibility over files like pensions and immigration. To be specific, the Trudeau government needs provincial partners to make good on a good chunk of its agenda, including access to legal cannabis, pension reform, and the reduction of carbon emissions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The political landscape has changed a lot since Mr. Trudeau became the leader of the Liberal Party of Canada. At first, finding provincial partners was easy. His own victory seemed to become contagious and, one after another, provincial Liberal governments were elected or re-elected after he won the leadership. His personal popularity hoisted that of other Liberal leaders, including some who struggled to make connections with voters.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By the end of 2015, seven of 10 provinces were governed by Liberal leaders and, in Alberta, Mr. Trudeau had a friend in NDP Premier Rachel Notley. But events have shifted the dynamics of intergovernmental relations in Canada. Now, four of those seven provinces have changed governing parties and Ms. Notley is a lot less friendly. The pipeline saga, the oil crisis in Alberta, and the resistance of several provinces to the national carbon price have created some new and perhaps durable interprovincial alliances, which is not good news for Mr. Trudeau.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One implication of Mr. Harper’s decision to take a pass on first ministers’ meetings was that it gave premiers something in common: a shared frustration at being sidelined by the prime minister. In the absence of a federally co-ordinated dialogue, it made the prime minister a somewhat easy target for premiers looking to blame the federal government for its absenteeism on social, environmental and economic matters. It was often said at the time that the premiers were, in fact, the federal government’s official opposition.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Mr. Trudeau might be headed toward a similar federal-provincial conflict, despite his very different approach to intergovernmental negotiations. For example, his plan for a national carbon price has been met with sustained resistance from several premiers who are looking to the courts to rule that the measure is unconstitutional.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Just months away from a federal vote, this is a dangerous time to lose momentum on delivering promises. Though it is still too early for the release of campaign platforms, we can presume that a second mandate for Mr. Trudeau’s government would include a similar policy agenda that would require provincial collaboration. In this case, the Prime Minister might have some work to do in forging new friendships among his provincial colleagues.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The burger at The Beltliner in Calgary is sloppy, two patties of Alberta beef and a fried egg. Danita Short smiles as she digs in: “I've got to pay respects to the homeland."</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Short, dressed in a flowing mustard cardigan and a flat-brim felt cowboy hat, is founder, chief executive and primary muse of an upstart fashion label called Land of Distraction. A year ago, the label announced itself at a splashy party at the Chateau Marmont in Los Angeles that drew the likes of Kate Bosworth and Angela Bassett. A few months later, the company landed a deal to sell its clothes at Barneys, a luxury retailer in the United States. There was a lot of hype: Interview Magazine called Land of Distraction “L.A.'s coolest new label."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This unlikely rise is underpinned by the coming together of an unusual trio: Laurie Venning, a welder who made a fortune in the oil patch; Christian Juul Nielsen, a fashion designer who was a rising star at <span class="companylink">Christian Dior</span>; and Ms. Short, a Harley-riding farm girl-turned-nurse-turned-fashion impresario.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now comes the hard part.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We have a business," said Mr. Venning, owner of L.A.-based Distraction Wear USA Inc. “That in itself is huge. But we're not even a year old. Until you're at the four-, five-year mark, you really don't know anything."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Short grew up on a farm some 300 kilometres northeast of Calgary. Coronation, the closest town, was a half-hour away and home to fewer than 1,000 people. Ms. Short was the oldest of four kids.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Theirs was an imaginative childhood, spent building forts and playing dress-up.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The kids rode horses. The life imbued a free spirit in Ms. Short.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She became an emergency room and trauma nurse at Foothills Medical Centre in Calgary. “My brain runs on that level," she said between bites of the burger during a visit home to see family. “Organized chaos and critical thinking." Outside work, she took off on cross-continent rides on her <span class="companylink">Harley Davidson</span> motorcycle. Long stretches of road, sunrises and sunsets and Motel 6s.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A few years ago, the intensity of work burned her out. She looked to start an esthetics business. She connected with Mr.Venning at a business-development session. He, too, had grown up on an Alberta farm. He became a welder and built drilling rigs. He was a tinkerer, and in the 1990s helped create specialized pipe for heavy oil wells. In mid-2014, at the peak of the last oil boom, he sold Regent Energy, the company he co-founded, for $775-million to <span class="companylink">Advent International</span>, a private equity firm.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Venning was struck by Ms. Short's distinct style and flair. He proposed they start a fashion label with Ms. Short herself as creative inspiration. They sought the help of Josh Reed, who had done celebrity public relations for Calvin Klein. The group brainstormed the concept and ethos. They made a short video. It begins with a White Stripes guitar riff and the image of Ms. Short riding her Harley on a coastal California highway. Ms. Short declares in the video that Distraction clothing would let “people express their own inner badass and get out there and live and have fun."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The three took the idea to New York fashion week in September, 2016. Mr. Reed lined up days full of meetings. There were no clothes, but they said the concept was a hit. Ms. Short “was the foundation of the narrative," Mr. Reed said. “There wasn't anything like it."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">All they needed was a creative director to design the clothes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At a party at the Standard Hotel one night, Mr. Venning found Mr. Nielsen, a Dane who was in New York by way of Paris.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Venning asked how much freedom he had at couture houses such as Dior. Mr.Venning promised Mr. Nielsen free rein and equity in the company.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Nielsen was inspired by Ms. Short and visited her family farm. “Where does all this energy come from, this spontaneous way of living? I saw it in her childhood." Land of Distraction's clothes, advertised as “easy" and “utilitarian," are what Mr.Venning called “affordable luxury": US$595 dresses, US$350 tops, US$985 coats.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Venning has his own experience building a business and has assembled a small team of fashion business veterans around Ms. Short, who is now based in L.A.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Beyond Barneys, Land of Distraction is sold online and at several retailers in Japan. In Canada, it is at <span class="companylink">Hudson's Bay</span>, where the label has resonated with customers, according to Tyler Franch, the Bay's fashion director. There have been an array of challenges. Ms. Short juggles the logistics of getting the clothes made in downtown L.A., where a local manufacturer produces the pieces. Inventory piled up earlier this year. Growing so quickly from nothing has caused cash flow issues, and the company has yet to turn a profit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Short is working on business efficiencies to figure out how Land of Distraction can survive without Mr. Venning's money. The company may seek new investors. Ms. Short wants to expand to smaller boutiques and establish the label in places such as Paris. She wants to create menswear, too.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Fashion is especially difficult," said Joel Gregorio, who runs brand consultancy Sovereign State and advises at <span class="companylink">Ryerson University</span>'s Fashion Zone. But Mr.Gregorio said staking Land of Distraction on Ms. Short was savvy. “A lot of founders don't celebrate their own story."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Venning, who also has new ventures in film and television, knows the risks of such volatile industries. “I've spread some money out. We'll see how smart I am."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Nielsen, after 15 years in fashion, believes Land of Distraction can take off. “I'm very much ready for the brand to blow up," he said. “I think it can." Ms. Short's goal for Land of Distraction is likewise ambitious: “To get people everywhere to wear it."</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The notion that all of us unanimously support the bill is simply false</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Chief of the Kainaiwa (Blood Tribe).</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He is a pioneer in First Nations self-management of their resources, and a former CEO of the Indian Resource Council</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I have spent more than 45 years advocating for my people, working to battle on-reserve poverty and focusing on generating resource revenues to provide the employment and education that my community has every right to obtain. I have been deeply involved in the process that allowed communities like mine to begin to take over the management and control of our oil and gas resources from Ottawa. I care greatly about the future of my people and their ability to access natural-resource revenues. I believe that the Canadian energy discussion could use some hard messages right about now.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So a false impression exists – that Alberta First Nations unanimously support Bill C-69, which the federal government says will change how pipeline projects are assessed, regulated and consulted upon. While I can't explain where the communication broke down, I and the majority of Treaty 7 chiefs strongly oppose the bill for its likely devastating impact on our ability to support our community members, as it would make it virtually impossible for my nation to fully benefit from the development of our energy resources.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We are on record as very strongly opposing Bill C-69 in its current form. And we are greatly concerned that it spells reductions in earnings, profits and royalties from our lands.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While the Kainaiwa continue to fight against high unemployment, as well as the social destructiveness and health challenges such as addiction and other issues that often accompany poverty, my band's royalties have recently been cut by more than half. Furthermore, all drilling has been cancelled because of high price differentials – the enormous gap between what we get on a barrel of oil in comparison to the benchmark price – which has limited employment opportunities on our lands. And while production on our lands recently doubled, royalties have been cut.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sadly, that wasn't the end of the story: Due to a lack of Canadian pipeline capacity and a landlocked distribution network, the differential now approaches 50 per cent, and we expect a significant royalty reduction is in our future. We estimate the differential-related cut will cost every family in my band $1,400 a year – an enormous hit for a community dealing with poverty.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Add in the catastrophic differential to the damage C-69 could cause, along with the punitive Bill C-48 that allows virtually anything but Alberta energy products to be shipped from the West Coast, and you can see why we feel a curtailment in future drilling programs is likely the next shoe to drop.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now consider that there are 26 oil-producing First Nations in Western Canada. An estimate, provided by <span class="companylink">Indian Oil and Gas Canada</span> and verified by Indian Resource Canada, shows continued operation at the current differential will cost the families of producing nations several thousands of dollars a year. In that context, it'd be an understatement to say the policies proposed within Bills C-69 and C-48 are damaging our position by restricting access and reducing our ability to survive as a community.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I'm no proponent of roughshod, indiscriminate development that damages our collective environment, health and safety. But given all the consultation that's mandated at the startup of a project, why is it that when new federal policy is introduced that restricts a band's access to resource development, it requires no consultation whatsoever? Restricting my community's livelihood should warrant some level of discussion with us.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And in fact, this bill, rolling through Parliament without that consultation, lacks any screening for interveners, so everyone would have the right to intervene in a process about developments in our territory, no matter where they reside. This means that the new bill threatens to undermine our legacy as stewards of our territory for thousands of years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Our federal policy-makers should consider that, in some 70 years of experience in the oil and gas sector, my tribe has never seen any significant level of environmental failure, nor damage to the land, water, air, animals or people. Yet the clamour to line up “unanimous" First Nations support for these excessive measures has gone so far as to encourage non-Indigenous people to speak for Indigenous ones.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Until the federal government responds to our concerns in a meaningful way on these flawed proposals, the Kainaiwa/Blood Tribe, a member of the Blackfoot Confederacy, is opposed to these proposals.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And for others, it should be considered a cautionary tale.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Without warning, his baby had stopped breathing, and he frantically performed CPR while his friend James Gallagher called 911.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Years later, the men still become emotional remembering that day. Boissonneault learned that his daughter had a rare disorder that caused epilepsy, and when pharmaceutical medications failed to cure her seizures, he turned to CBD oil, a non-psychoactive substance in marijuana.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's been two years now and she hasn't had a seizure," Boissonneault said, standing next to rows of pungent marijuana plants under glowing white lights. "That's what got me involved in this. It's quite personal. ... The only profit it gives me is the joy of seeing my daughter smile."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Boissonneault and Gallagher now run a handful of small legal medical grow-ops in British Columbia and are among the "craft" producers who hope to use their skills in the fledgling recreational market by getting a new licence for microcultivation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But would-be applicants are discovering a major hurdle in their way: obtaining municipal approval and zoning, a key requirement of the licences. Many cities have not established zoning and either aren't ready or are reluctant to allow microcultivation, growers say.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Small growers say the federal government failed to educate municipalities about the new licences and the need to create zoning to support them. As a result, they say, applications are delayed, the legal supply chain is beset with shortages and the illegal market continues to flourish.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The spirit (of microcultivation licences) was to get the small growers involved and to get the black market to convert over to the new market," said James Walsh, president of the BC Micro Licence Association. "In reality we're just not seeing it."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ottawa began accepting applications from microgrowers on Oct. 17, the same day it legalized recreational weed. The licences cover 200 square metres of plant canopy, allowing a premium cannabis producer to make up to $3 million in gross revenue a year, Walsh said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But many small growers have not been able to apply to the federal government because they are still waiting for local zoning, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">Health Canada</span> said it has received 23 applications for the licences so far, including five in B.C., five in Alberta, seven in Ontario and six in Quebec.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Cannabis legalization was the result of more than two years of consultation with all levels of government, and <span class="companylink">Health Canada</span> has answered many questions from municipalities and remains available to do so, said spokeswoman Tammy Jarbeau.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"<span class="companylink">Health Canada</span> has encouraged and supported municipalities to put in place standards and local bylaws as necessary," she said in a statement.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Federation of Canadian Municipalities published a guide to cannabis legalization in August 2017, providing advice on bylaws, zoning and business practices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The federation stressed the need to respect local authority during legalization consultations, it says on its website.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, small growers say they're encountering municipal red tape and it's especially bad in B.C., despite its reputation as a marijuana mecca.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Part of the issue is B.C.'s Agricultural Land Reserve, legislation protecting farmland from being taken over by industry and residential development. In July, the province introduced a law allowing cities to prohibit concrete-based pot facilities on the land reserve.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There's good reason to ban pouring concrete on precious agricultural land, said Malcolm Brodie, the mayor of Richmond, B.C.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Very simply, you put that kind of construction on the farmland, you'll never have it for soil-based farming again," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The city only wants one cannabis facility and it already has one, a licensed producer in an industrial area, said Brodie. Applications in industrial areas will be considered on a case-by-case basis, though he wouldn't guarantee any would be approved, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are already "hundreds and hundreds" of black-market grow-ops on the land reserve, said one small grower who asked not to be identified due to legal concerns. Within a 10-minute drive from his property, over $1 million in cannabis is likely being produced monthly, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Do they want us to keep growing the weed and selling it out the back door or do they want the tax money?" he asked. "We're going to do it on ALR land regardless."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Growers use concrete facilities because soil is more likely to breed mould, yeast and bacteria, and open-air farming is impossible due to weather, he added.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Ontario, some municipalities created zoning before Oct. 17 while others have waited until microcultivator applicants approach them, said Mathew Columbro, president and founder of consultancy firm Vindica Cannabis Corp.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I think Ontario is doing a little bit better than B.C., but it's not perfect," Columbro said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The application portal should have been opened prior to legalization day, instead large licensed producers got the first shot at the market, said Ian Dawkins, president of the Cannabis Commerce Association of Canada.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The big story is fairness," he said. "If big business is afforded an opportunity to bid on something and small business is iced out, then that is considered an egregious policy failure.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Yet on this enormous multibillion-dollar national project, where is that same leadership?" Small medical producers have put a lot of time and passion into growing quality marijuana, said Gallagher, looking out over the thriving grow-op he shares with Boissonneault.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We do have a lot of knowledge and we want to see how that transitions," he said. "Can we turn this into a business now that it's legal? That's something that's always been on our minds."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Alberta Party, which currently holds the third most seats of any party in the province's legislature, released a statement on Friday asking Premier Rachel Notley to deliver this message to the federal government while visiting Ottawa for this weekend's first ministers' conference. The party is calling for a $2 surtax per barrel of foreign-produced oil imported into Canada that doesn't meet the country's standards.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While this a matter handled by the federal government, not the provinces, Alberta Party Leader Stephen Mandel said he'd like to see Notley call for this tax on countries who have poor records on environmental protection, human rights and respect for the rule of law.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“From my point of view, this offers a way of levelling the playing field,” said Mandel.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We think this is a reasonable way to do things. A $2 per barrel surcharge and then that money will go into a fund for purchasing railcars for either oil production or production for grain.”</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“It is imperative the federal government focus on increasing Canada's competitiveness by improving market access with new pipelines and address the regulatory uncertainty currently affecting industry,” said Elisabeth Besson, CAPP spokesperson in an emailed statement.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the <span class="companylink">Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers</span> did criticize the federal government for accepting oil imports from foreign sources with questionable human rights records like Saudi Arabia, while Alberta has struggled to increase takeaway capacity for its own oil.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Friday, in initial meetings with other first ministers, Notley also called for more infrastructure construction in Canada to benefit Alberta's energy industry. She also spoke about greater job protection in Alberta's oilpatch and support to increase takeaway capacity for the province's oil by rail.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Notley said she was happy with the response she received from the political leaders she met with in Ottawa on Friday about this matter. But she called Alberta's inability to get what she sees as full value for its oil a crisis facing the whole country.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I said the problems relating to that are part of a very slow car crash that we have been watching for over a decade now,” Notley said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“And as first ministers, we have all been very polite in sitting around and admiring the problem, and that it was time for us to stop doing that and take action.”</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In just over 10 years, if everything goes according to plan, British Columbia will have turned its back on the oil and gas that currently provides up to two thirds of the energy powering residences, businesses and industry. Instead, the province will be electrified, switched on through a reliance on its natural bounty of hydro electricity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To get there, the CleanBC plan[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/canada/british-columbia/article-bc-climate-plan-proposes-changes-that-will-impact-every-part-of-the/] – endorsed by groups as disparate as the BC Business Council, the federal environment minister and David Suzuki himself – has proposed a series of tax breaks and other incentives to ensure a monumental shift in how we live, work and get around.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To cut the province’s carbon footprint by 19 million tonnes of GHG emission, the plan calls for increasing electricity demand by 8 per cent in the next 12 years. That amounts to the equivalent of adding a second City of Vancouver to the electricity grid. And to meet the goals set out by 2030, there will be a further six-million-tonne reduction needed, with a plan for that not ready for another two years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Justine Hunter and Ian Bailey, who covered the plan all week, note to meet the targets, the building code will have to be revised to ensure new energy-efficient designs. Infrastructure to support zero-emission vehicles will be expanded. And new power-transmission lines will offer heavy polluters the opportunity to convert to cleaner energy for production.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The province aims to reduce GHG emissions by 40 per cent by 2030 (against 2007 levels), 60 per cent by 2040 and 80 per cent by 2050. That while still accommodating a massive energy-intensive liquefied natural gas project in the northwestern part of the province, which, when up and running, will belch millions of tonnes of GHG emissions into the atmosphere each year. The carbon tax, which is $35 a tonne now, will rise in $5 increments to $50 by 2021,</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Besides the need to change behaviour, the province will have to grapple with how to provide all that electricity. The debate over whether to build Site C seems well in the past: that massive project won’t be able to accommodate the extra need. Rather, <span class="companylink">BC Hydro</span> is going to have to build transmission lines and there will be an important role and opportunity for producers of alternative energy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The plan doesn’t impose penalties, something Greg D’Avignon of the BC Business Council said would be counterproductive. [https://www.theglobeandmail.com/canada/british-columbia/article-bc-climate-plan-opts-for-incentives-over-strong-arming/] Instead of sticks, the plan offers carrots including potential loans and rebates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Who will pay for the carrots is not yet defined and won’t be at least until February’s budget. But Mr. D’Avignon cautioned against an aggressive approach, noting that heavy taxes and penalties will simply prompt investment to flee to a myriad of other places in the world that aren’t taking climate change as seriously. British Columbia can and must do its part. But it’s a tiny piece of a huge whole, he told Justine.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">OIL:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For Alberta, the week started off with an act of urgency that some might call desperation. Premier Rachel Notley announced her government would intervene in the market [https://www.theglobeandmail.com/business/article-alberta-premier-notley-to-address-province-on-industry-wide-limits-on/] and ordered the province’s oil sector to cut production starting in the new year. It is a bid to deflate a supply glut that has cratered prices and threatened thousands of jobs and it was a move that was in deep contrast with Alberta’s traditional free-market outlook.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The move had a swift impact[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/business/article-canadas-crude-producers-see-shares-jump-on-alberta-production-cuts/] . Monday, the day after Ms. Notley’s announcement, Western Canadian oil prices surged and they bumped up [https://www.theglobeandmail.com/investing/article-canadian-oil-prices-are-suddenly-on-a-tear/] again Friday. Shawn McCarthy [https://www.theglobeandmail.com/business/article-ottawa-will-exempt-some-oil-sands-projects-from-environmental-review/] explained that Ottawa moved to exempt in situ oil-sands projects – which typically use steam to extract the bitumen from underground – from the list of projects that will receive a full impact assessment under Bill C-69. The bill has drawn the ire of Ms. Notley and other critics in the oil patch for amping up the environment-assessment process.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">PIPELINES:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Justin Giovannetti writes about a group of First Nations leaders pushing for an Indigenous-led pipeline project[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/canada/british-columbia/article-first-nations-lobbying-for-lift-on-tanker-ban-off-bcs-coast/] that would push through Northern British Columbia with a terminus in Lax Kw’alaams territory, just south of Alaska, the home of Calvin Helin. Mr. Helin is the president of Eagle Spirit Energy Holdings and he says he has the support of all the Indigenous groups along the route, as well as the premiers of Alberta and Saskatchewan. But he says current legislation going through the Senate that would ban tanker traffic off British Columbia’s north coast would strike an unconstitutional blow to the hopes of Indigenous groups looking to resource development to better their communities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">THE PIANO:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is likely a rare international competition that does not get heated, with high-strung perfectionists competing to be the top of their field. I suppose it should be no different for Calgary’s Honens International Piano Competition,[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/arts/theatre-and-performance/article-sponsorship-feud-strikes-a-sour-note-at-honens-international-piano/] but in this case, it wasn’t the competitors who are exercised. Western arts correspondent Marsha Lederman writes about the conflict between the makers of two brands of grand pianos, the kind in which sales start north of $100,000. Steinway, the 160-year-old U.S. brand, was given preferential placement by the competition, complained the people behind the Italian upstart Fazioli.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">RENTALS:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Vancouver city councillors[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/canada/british-columbia/article-vancouver-council-stymied-over-renovication-policy/] had to grapple this week with what everyone agrees is a need to protect renters while balancing the impact those protections might have on the need to ensure developers and landlords remain willing to keep up the existing rental stock and even bolster it with new units. The motion,[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/canada/british-columbia/article-proposed-plan-to-protect-tenants-in-vancouver-from-renovictions-sent/] put forward by councillor and anti-poverty activist Jean Swanson, was mostly set aside for further study. But advocates claimed a symbolic victory: At least council is listening following hours of heart-wrenching testimony.</p>

Gary Mason on B.C.'s climate plan: [https://www.theglobeandmail.com/opinion/article-bcs-great-leap-forward-on-climate-change/] ”With this plan, B.C. re-establishes its leadership role in Canada on climate matters. This was first recognized in 2008, when then-premier Gordon Campbell introduced the first carbon tax in Canada. But the province took a step back on this file under his successor Christy Clark – although she deserves credit for pushing Site C through. And the governing NDP’s plan doesn’t happen without that project – one the party often denounced and ridiculed when in Opposition.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Barrie McKenna on the oil crisis[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/business/commentary/article-hey-alberta-this-oil-crisis-is-not-our-doing/] : Alberta, “you are free to fulfill your energy destiny. Indeed, we are glad to see you are taking steps to do just that – by announcing a province-wide oil production cut and ordering thousands of oil tanker railway cars to relieve pipeline bottlenecks. Godspeed. We all hope these efforts will help get you a fair price for your oil. But the victim-complex is getting tired. It’s nonsense to suggest that the federal government somehow wants Alberta to crash, as politicians and pundits in your province have been hollering for weeks.”</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">OTTAWA -- A blast of new jobs last month knocked the country's unemployment rate down to its lowest level since <span class="companylink">Statistics Canada</span> started measuring comparable data more than 40 years ago - but despite eye-catching progress, Friday's numbers also delivered disappointment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Canada added 94,100 net jobs for its largest monthly increase since March 2012 when there was a gain of 94,000 jobs, <span class="companylink">Statistics Canada</span> said in its labour force survey. The November surge was fuelled by other positives: 89,900 new full-time positions and 78,600 employee jobs in the private sector.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The jobless rate fell to 5.6 per cent last month from October's reading of 5.8 per cent, which had been the previous low mark since comparable data first became available in 1976. The old statistical approach - prior to 1976 - registered an unemployment rate reading of 5.4 per cent in 1974.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The improvements, however, obscured a key piece of data: weakening wage growth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Year-over-year average hourly wage growth for permanent employees continued its decline in November to 1.46 per cent - its lowest reading since July 2017. "There's no question that the headline job growth is gangbusters strong," said Frances Donald, head of macroeconomic strategy at <span class="companylink">Manulife Asset Management</span>
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I would caution us against celebrating too quickly, however, because wage growth is decelerating sharply."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Experts have been expecting wage growth to pick up its pace, thanks to the tightened labour market. But the opposite has been happening - wage growth has dropped every month since its May peak of 3.9 per cent and now sits well below inflation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">Bank of Canada</span> keeps a close watch on wages ahead of its interest-rate decisions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The central bank has raised the rate five times since the summer of 2017 in response to Canada's strong economic performance. Governor Stephen Poloz has signalled that more increases will be needed to keep inflation from rising too high.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Wednesday, however, Poloz held the benchmark rate at 1.75 per cent. In explaining the decision, he highlighted other economic negatives such as weaker-than-expected business investment and the steep slide in oil prices. The bank's next rate announcement will be Jan. 9. Donald expects the bank to remain focused on oil prices, the capacity of the energy sector to engage in business investment and the ability of Canadians - many of whom are carrying very high debt loads - to manage higher interest rates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Canadians need more wage growth to offset higher interest rates," she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"If we're seeing wage growth that can't even keep up with the pace of inflation, it makes it much more difficult for households to absorb the <span class="companylink">Bank of Canada</span>'s desire to lift rates higher from this point forward."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Poloz, she added, will be more concerned about the slowdown in wages rather than optimistic about the overall job gain, particularly since it could affect the pace at which he will lift rates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Royce Mendes of CIBC Economics said the <span class="companylink">Bank of Canada</span> will take notice of the "massive reading" in the November jobs report as it mulls next month's rate decision.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By region, employment rose in six provinces and was led by gains in Quebec and Alberta.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><br/><b>ART</b>&nbsp;</td><td><br/>The overall jobs number marked the monthly labour force survey's largest increase since March 2012.

 Workers are pictured at the Vancouver Shipyard. Statistics Canada says the country gained 63,000 jobs in September, edging the unemployment rate lower to 5.9 per cent.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MONTREAL — Premier Brian Pallister is challenging his colleagues to come forward when they're responsible for the patchwork of laws and regulations that impede economic growth.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“What we have to start doing is being more transparent as provincial leaders on what we're doing and what we're not doing. And if some of the premiers don't want certain regulatory changes, they can say so," Pallister said as he left meetings with the other 12 premiers and Prime Minister Justin Trudeau in Montreal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While other premiers focused on the federal carbon tax and Alberta's plunging oil price, Pallister said his months-long push to break down barriers to interprovincial trade is bearing fruit. He also said Ottawa is hinting at support for a transmission line to send some of Manitoba's hydro power into coal-dependent Saskatchewan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While he voiced support for helping Alberta get its oil to market and briefly decried the federal carbon tax, Pallister struck his own path Friday by focusing on trade rules and requirements that vary by province.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">Statistics Canada</span> estimated last year those barriers mean Canadians pay what's effectively a 6.9 per cent tariff on goods from other provinces.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I wanted these things resolved 20 years ago. That being said, we've made more progress in recent months than we've made in long, long time as a country," Pallister told the Free Press.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In July, Ottawa and the provinces identified 23 issues for their departments to sort through, but postponed dealing with trucking requirements, such as fuel permits and the timelines for semi-trailer registration.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Some of our trucking companies, I'm told, have had to change tires at provincial borders, just crazy stuff," the premier claimed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The trucking industry has a strong foothold in Manitoba, and Pallister said he “should have something to announce fairly quickly" around harmonizing their tire regulations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pallister pointed out that territories will likely need their own rules because their roads are constructed differently than in the provinces. For him, it's an example of legitimate differences that some jurisdictions will have to hold onto while others cut red tape that doesn't serve a purpose.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Each of these things on their own don't sound like a big deal, but they add up. And there are hundreds and hundreds of these types of impediments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Perfection's been the enemy of the achievement of any real progress," he said, “because when you need everybody to agree, they don't."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pallister also said Ottawa seems open to supporting a project that aims to send some of Manitoba's hydro into Saskatchewan; he said Trudeau was “excited" about the idea of “a hydro pipeline" from Quebec to Saskatchewan, at least.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In late October, <span class="companylink">Manitoba Hydro</span> inked the largest of three recent deals with <span class="companylink">SaskPower</span> to send electricity to the neighbouring province for two decades beginning in 2022, through a transmission line announced in 2015.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Saskatchewan Premier Scott Moe didn't give details on what Ottawa said, but explained that the discussion came in the context of Alberta's struggles to get oil to market and the need to better link and export all forms of energy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We talked about the opportunities for corridors between our nation for all energy products," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“It's incumbent on us to maximize that value."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The premier said in a teleconference with reporters that it was a “win-win-win" for weaning Saskatchewan off coal-fired power, providing Manitoba an outlet for its excess hydro production and helping Ottawa meet its carbon-reduction targets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We'll be pursuing that with enthusiasm," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, Pallister had little to say about the federal carbon tax, which Ottawa will impose on Manitoba next year after the premier scrapped his own flat tax two months ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I'm not interested in having a fight with the prime minister today on this issue. But ultimately we have to agree to disagree on this approach," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On the eve of the meeting, media focused on premiers threatening to walk out or, in one case, dismissing federal briefings as “fluff."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The acrimony seemed to dissipate Friday, although Ontario Premier Doug Ford slammed Ottawa, claiming it had moved its climate change goalposts by asking Ontario to cut more greenhouse gas emissions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Premiers otherwise seemed content, but pointed to little concrete progress on virtually any issue.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pallister said it was a productive six hours of discussion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The prime minister's a congenial human being and he, I think, did an admirable job of building on that goodwill as we went through the meeting," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The reality is: we're thinking people, so we're not always going to agree."</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It looked for a while like a lot of premiers were going to band together to take on Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. But it was no united front. They disagreed among themselves more than with the feds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Alberta Premier Rachel Notley and Saskatchewan's Scott Moe came roaring into the first ministers' meeting in Montreal insisting an oil crisis might be the country's top priority, and three provinces came insisting they'd put a stop to federal carbon taxes.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But for every priority put forward by any two or three provinces, from oil-sector help to promoting pipelines to compensation for housing asylum seekers, there were other provinces who didn't agree, or didn't care.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And there was a divide between premiers of those oilproducing provinces and some of the others – notably Quebec's François Legault.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Notley's big mission here was to get all of the federation to agree that the top economic threat to the country is discounted Alberta oil prices exacerbated by a lack of sufficient pipelines and transportation – and to be seen demanding that Ottawa help.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Trudeau agreed it's a crisis and said Ottawa is looking at options – but Mr. Legault wasn't sympathetic. He argued he's got the same problem with undeveloped hydroelectricity that Quebec would like to sell.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Those oil provinces want more pipelines, and New Brunswick's new Progressive Conservative Premier, Blaine Higgs, has been calling for the revival of the nowcancelled Energy East pipeline project from Alberta to Saint John – but Mr. Legault said no way.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There's no “social acceptance" for a new oil pipeline across Quebec, he said – adding that he's “not shy about refusing dirty energy."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ouch. That's not going to create interprovincial unity. In truth, there wasn't that much from the start.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Legault's priority was asking for compensation for providing services for asylum seekers; Ontario Premier Doug Ford took a similar view, although he missed the part of the talks that dealt with the issue, but the other premiers didn't really care. Manitoba's Brian Pallister wanted to talk about interprovincial trade barriers, but most of the others seemed to have other things on their minds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The premiers never joined together for a full-court press on Mr. Trudeau. The provinces that came in asking for money from Ottawa mostly left saying the PM was seriously considering their request. Everyone wanted something, but not the same things.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Everyone wanted to talk about the economy, but their economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Ford came out blasting at Mr. Trudeau's carbon taxes – but the gist of his complaint was that Ontario is being asked to reduce emissions by a greater percentage than other provinces. In other words, he doesn't want to pick up the slack for Alberta.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Ford insisted that “the goalposts got changed" on climate targets – accusing Mr. Trudeau of suddenly telling his province it had to cut emissions by more than what was previously set.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It was an aggressive attempt to cast Mr. Trudeau as picking on Ontario – but it sowed confusion with his chief ally in the fight against carbon taxes, Mr. Moe.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Canada has a national target to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 30 per cent below 2005 levels by 2030. But at past meetings, premiers had accepted the notion that some provinces will cut more than others – Alberta, for example, was never going to meet the 30-per-cent mark. But Ontario, under the previous Liberal government, had pledged to make deeper 37-per-cent cuts until Mr. Ford's government lowered the targets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Suddenly, it was Mr. Ford complaining that Ontario had to pick up slack for provinces that haven't cut their emissions – and Mr. Trudeau, behind close doors, retorted that if some provinces didn't do more, it would mean shutting down the oil sands.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And comically, as Mr. Moe joined him in accusing Mr. Trudeau of “moving the goalposts" on emissions targets, he provided precisely the opposite argument: While Mr. Ford complained it is unfair to ask one province to cut more than another, Mr. Moe insisted it is unfair to ask a resource province such as his to cut as much as others.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the end, Mr. Trudeau wasn't engulfed by a confrontation with the premiers. Their goals were so divided they never made him their common target.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The returns offered by cash proxies such as guaranteed investment certificates and shortterm government bonds, while modest, are at least positive.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Long-term Canadian bonds, on the other hand, have retreated as yields have increased, while the S&P/TSX Composite Index is down 8 per cent this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Also in negative territory: equities, corporate debt and government bond indexes in many global markets, as well as a range of commodities from crude oil to gold and copper.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The global downturn in financial assets this year has produced a rare top ranking for cash.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Cash to me is a legitimate asset class," said John Zechner, president of Toronto-based wealth management company J.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Zechner Associates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I've been through too many cycles when I was kicking myself for not selling enough when valuations were extended and things were slowing down."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Over the course of the bull run that began when markets bottomed out in 2009, rock-bottom interest rates and meagre bond yields pushed income investors into the stock market as the only place to earn a decent return.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Cash was seen as dead money.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This year, however, cash has proved its value as a hedge against stock volatility.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Cash returns as approximated by Canada three-month treasury bills have exceeded Canadian equity returns by about 10 percentage points.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the United States, cash proxies have also outperformed the S&P 500, which has been driven into negative territory on the year by the recent sell-off.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Going into next year, muted expectations for equity performance, combined with rising interest rates, have shifted the prospects for relative performance between asset classes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Cash will represent a competitive asset class to stocks for the first time in many years," said David Kostin, chief U.S. equity strategist at <span class="companylink">Goldman Sachs</span>, in his 2019 outlook.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But U.S. investors are not positioned for a late-cycle market, when equity returns tend to become less reliable and more volatile, Mr. Kostin said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the end of the second quarter, households, mutual funds, foreign investors and pension funds with money in the U.S.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">market had a 44-per-cent weighting in equities – the highest level of equity exposure since the tech bubble in the late 1990s, Mr. Kostin said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the same time, those investors had cash allocations of 12 per cent, which is the lowest in 30 years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We recommend mixed-asset investors recalibrate their portfolios by reducing equity holdings and lifting cash allocations," Mr. Kostin said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">Goldman Sachs</span> is projecting that the S&P 500 will generate a modest, single-digit return next year, while three-month T-bills should see a total return of 3 per cent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Canada, returns on shortterm investments have risen in recent months as the <span class="companylink">Bank of Canada</span> has hiked policy rates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One-year GICs now offer as much as 3 per cent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“You're not going to retire rich on that, but cash is at least going to give you your money back, with a bit of return," said Ian de Verteuil, head of portfolio strategy for CIBC World Markets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Expectations for higher shortterm rates in Canada have fallen back of late, however, as the collapse of Alberta crude prices has clouded the domestic economic outlook.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But nominal cash returns will at least be guaranteed to be positive and with next to no volatility.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Holding cash provides some downside protection and defensiveness," said Colin Stewart, chief executive and portfolio manager at JC Clark Ltd. in Toronto.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“It can be useful in periods of uncertainty. And now would be one of those times."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In JC Clark's long-only funds, cash weightings sit between 10 per cent and 30 per cent, Mr. Stewart said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I would not want to suggest that we or anyone else have a long-term investment strategy of holding 30-per-cent cash.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“That's just not a smart idea," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Inflation erodes the value of cash, while equities have generally proven to generate superior returns over the long term.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Western Canadian Select was trading for US$38.12 a barrel on Friday afternoon, up 15.6 per cent from Thursday's close, marking the latest round of gains after Alberta Premier Rachel Notley announced production cuts, to take effect in January, aimed at lifting rock-bottom prices. Faced with a pipeline bottleneck and rising inventories, Alberta's oil prices had plummeted in recent months, with WCS hitting a record low of less than US$14 in November.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This week's rally has resulted in a significant narrowing of the price differential between WCS and West Texas Intermediate, the U.S. benchmark. WCS now sells for a US$15-a-barrel discount to WTI; in October, the price gap had ballooned to US$50, the largest discount in Bloomberg data going back to 2008. A key metric in the oil patch, the differential is now slightly better than the historical average of US$17.37.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Friday's rally also puts WCS in the neighborhood of some longrange estimates. Joan Pinto, associate and energy specialist at CIBC Capital Markets, issued a forecast this week that pegged WCS at an average price of US$40.50 a barrel in 2019 and US$41.75 the following year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Global oil prices rallied on Friday after “OPEC-plus" announced a bigger-than-expected cut to crude production. (“OPECplus" refers to the <span class="companylink">Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries</span>, along with other producers that had agreed to a previous supply cap, such as Russia.) WTI jumped 4.5 per cent to US$53.83 a barrel, and Brent crude was up 5 per cent to $63.06, as of early Friday afternoon.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This fall, after a lifetime working the fields surrounding his southwest Saskatchewan home, Gord Will retired. Over the years, he's been eyewitness to a changing industry – one that affects us all. He's also one of a dwindling number. His stepdaughter, Joanne Will, examines the disappearance of the family farm, and what we stand to lose</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Joanne Will is a journalist based on Vancouver Island.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She has been a regular contributor to The Globe and Mail since 2009. In 2014, she was a Knight-Wallace Journalism Fellow at the University of Michigan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In August, my stepfather, Gord Will, announced that this fall would be his last harvest. At 72, and with each of those years spent on the vast agricultural plains in the rural municipality of Wheatlands, near the village of Mortlach in southwest Saskatchewan, he is putting away his combine and his grain trucks, his tractors and granaries, his auger, swather, cultivator, baler, sprayer and seeder.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Gord's fleet of equipment, some of it dating back to the 1960s, is in solid working condition, and each piece carries untold memories. Sentimentality aside, the machinery and implements can be sold, rented, lent or gifted to other grain, pulse, oilseed, hay and forage farmers. It will live on, so long as it is found useful, and so long as someone tends to it with the same meticulous care that he has.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But what of Gord's accumulated and intimate knowledge of more than 2,000 acres of prairie pasture and cropland, including significant wetlands and wildlife habitat, cared for throughout his lifetime? Or his keen observations of the weather and changing climate in this semi-arid region of the Great Plains known as Palliser's Triangle? And his lifetime of experience and understanding of what has increasingly become the “business" of farming? And what of the community that counts on him, and others like him, to be its lifeblood?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">My stepfather is not the last farmer, but he represents the last of a certain type.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The family farm is disappearing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When you think of farming, you may well picture the industrialscale factories and megafarms that produce the lion's share of what you'll find for sale at your local supermarket. Or you may think of the truly small-scale operations whose proprietors sell their hand-picked wares at farmers' markets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But in fact, there's another size of operation, one that sits in the middle of those two extremes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Owned and operated by families firmly linked to the local community, medium-sized family farms are big enough to supply significantly more food than the vendors you'll meet at those Saturday-morning booths staffed by a farmer who operates an acre or two. And yet, they manage to be much better for the land, for rural communities and, I'd argue, for the health of Canada, than outfits that are run by large corporations or land-owning investors who either hire their own managers or lease out their land to those who work it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">My stepfather's final harvest has reminded me that the family farm is home to one of the most important and noble jobs on the planet – one that involves working with one's neighbours and with the land, all in the name of feeding a lot of people you will likely never meet face to face.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When families own the land, that is what they do.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The loss of any family farm is, in my eyes, nothing less than a tragedy. For all of us.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">FARMING IN THE BLOOD Gord is a wellspring of information and of history that originates long before his birth, and that was passed on by elder farmers in fields and coffee shops, in grainelevator lineups and at farm-supply stores and community gatherings. Such history was also transmitted at home, by his father, James Will, who emigrated to Saskatchewan from Scotland in 1921 at the age of 19.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Gord was only 10 when his father died of cancer. But the young boy was surrounded by family and community, including uncles and several neighbouring farmers who showed him the ropes. In the spring of 1965, the year after he graduated from high school, Gord planted his first crop.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“There was never any time I can remember that I had any notion of doing anything else," he told me recently, as we walked through one of our favourite fields in the undulating Coteau Hills. “I remember going to the circus with my dad, and the main thing I was interested in was how much horsepower the elephants had."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">My mother, Nora, moved to Mortlach while I was a toddler, in the late 1970s, after she and Gord married. A 30-minute drive west of Moose Jaw, this is where they had three more children: twin girls and a son. Although Gord grew up on what we call “the home farm" – the three quartersections of land south of Mortlach that his father bought after working for several years at a nearby ranch – our family always lived in the village (current population 261) in view of the K-to-12 school.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When Gord and my mother started their family, things were booming. They paid cash for the house they built in 1978, and worked hard to acquire more farmland and the tools needed to work it. I remember well the fall of 1983 and the arrival of Gord's first four-wheel-drive tractor.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Back then, he always had a fulltime hired hand from spring until fall, through the busy seeding and harvest seasons. At harvest time itself, an assortment of other help would show up: relatives whose jobs were far from the land, and a farming friend and neighbour or two who had finished their own work. Everyone pitched in before the frost and snow arrived.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">My mother would make dinner for the crew. Along with pots of meat and vegetables, Thermoses of steaming tea and coffee, trays of pies and other desserts, she'd pack us kids in the car, a dust trail following us down the gravel roads to the field being worked that day. It was our nightly ritual from late August to early November.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At our destination, we'd spread two or three heavy wool blankets and quilts over the golden stubble and dirt, unfold stools and lawn chairs, and unpack the meal. The men would pull up in their harvest equipment, and while they ate, we played in the grain truck box, chewing mouthfuls of wheat kernels until they transformed into wads of wholewheat “gum." (I'm obliged to mention that today, playing in grain trucks, whether empty or loaded, is discouraged by farmsafety experts.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">THE SEEDS OF CALAMITY Then came the one-two punch of sharply rising interest rates and plunging commodity prices. Inflation-fighting rates that soared to nearly 22 per cent in 1981 stubbornly remained in the double digits for the best part of a decade, making land-mortgage payments hugely difficult, and sometimes impossible, to meet. By the summer of 1986, meanwhile, the price of wheat – the dominant crop then grown in the Prairies – dropped by more than 50 per cent from where it had stood in the fall of 1980. And as if those economic demons were not trouble enough, a drought rivalling that of the Great Depression descended on the Prairie provinces in the early eighties. Although it let up for a spell mid-decade, it came roaring back in 1987 and held firm through ‘89, packing its hardest punch in 1988, the single driest year in two decades.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 1988, roughly 10 per cent of farm workers left agriculture.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Crops were so poor – virtually non-existent in some areas – that Gord didn't even take his combine out of the Quonset hut. That fall and winter, he had to find work elsewhere to support our family and farm: He left for the oil rigs on the Saskatchewan-Alberta border, returning just in time to join Christmas dinner with his extended family in Moose Jaw.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As with the Depression of the thirties, the recession of the 1980s eventually ended; but it was long enough that many farmers had to let go of precious land for which high mortgage payments had become untenable. Land prices plummeted; it would be more than 20 years before they fully bounced back.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And there were new challenges to come. For those who survived, such as Gord, the industrial revolution of farming began to really take off: more mechanization, more chemicals, ever more costly equipment, constant consolidation. The pressure built, in the mantra of the time, to “get big or get out." On some levels, this created efficiencies. But on many others, something important was lost.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Just as Gord didn't foresee the downturn of the 1980s, we four children never envisioned, from within the landscape of our youth, the realities of agriculture today: sky-high land prices; farms comprising many thousands of acres; an explosion of technology, including tractors with GPS and automated steering; and maximum farm-credit loans reaching sky-high levels.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The most recent Canadian Census of Agriculture, in 2016, tells much of the story.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Between 2011 and 2016, the value of all farm machinery and equipment, owned and leased, increased more than 15 per cent, to $54-billion. Agricultural land and buildings increased in value by more than a third, to $428-billion. In the same period, the total value of the largest category of tractors grew a stunning 50 per cent, to $9.4-billion, accounting for more than half the value of all tractors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Farming has become a case of survival of the fittest. Or more accurately, the biggest.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One result of this relentless shift: Fewer farmers are “required." In 2016, 193,492 agricultural operations were counted nationwide, down roughly 6 per cent from 2011, while the size of farms (once again) increased.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is, in many ways, an old story.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Saskatchewan alone, between 1911 and 2016, the number of farms dropped by 64 per cent, even as the amount of total farmland more than doubled. And over that century, the size of the average farm sextupled – from 295 acres to 1,784 acres. And where will it end?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“One day, and it's not too far off, there won't be any people out there farming the land," Gord predicts. “In some ways, I'm glad I'm finishing before that happens." This isn't science fiction: Small autonomous tractors, just like driverless cars, are already being introduced at agricultural shows.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As a country, we're the world's fifth-largest exporter of agricultural commodities – even as fewer than 1 per cent of us operate farms.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But a robot driven solely by the corporate profit motive cannot smell the soil it is tilling. It does not feel in its very core the need to preserve that soil for future generations. And the only meal it presents you with is one produced at the lowest possible cost, using the cheapest possible inputs, grown on industrial-sized fields. Your health, and the health of the community in which you live, will not be the driver of this kind of food production. The stock market, with its eye on instant gratification for investors, will be.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We will no longer have any farmers at all – only “food production."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">‘IT'S NOT A HEALTHY SYSTEM' The average Canadian farmer is 55 years old. The next generation, those under 35, represent fewer than 10 per cent of farmers. And the future for them does not look bright. Only one in 12 farms nationally has a formal succession plan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Saskatchewan – the province with the largest area of field crops, the largest average farm size and the most (relatively) affordable land – is a microcosm of what's occurring in the rest of the country. The average value of land and buildings in the province (about $1,200 an acre) increased 76 per cent from 2011 to 2016. And yet, that's still less than half the national average (almost $2,700 an acre), which increased close to 40 per cent over the same period.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At today's prices, apart from taking over an existing family operation – itself a daunting prospect, given the competitive pressures kindled and stoked by Big Agribusiness – how can a new farmer ever afford to get started?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Gord's first tractor, a used model, cost $1,700. His next, also second-hand, was $7,500. His third, a brand-new 1976 model, was $17,000 when he ordered it; due to high demand, by the time it arrived at the dealership, the price had shot up to $22,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sound like a lot? Today a new combine can run up to $750,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Altogether, a combine, seeder, tractor and sprayer can run from $1.5-million to $2-million and even higher.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Interest rates are relatively low these days. But what happens if you're highly leveraged and rates go up, as they did in the 1980s?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“You'd pretty much have to turn and run," Gord says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Gord himself has witnessed a fourfold increase in crop production in his lifetime. Yields per acre have doubled thanks to better technology, not to mention new seed varieties, pesticides and fertilizers – and thanks, as well, to more land being constantly pressed into service: Summerfallow – alternately working a field one year, then leaving it to rest the next – is no longer widely practised. “In a good year now, 40 to 45 bushels-to-the-acre crops are common," my stepfather says, while “in the old days, if someone had a 30-bushels-tothe-acre crop, people would drive to that field just to see it."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But grain prices have not kept pace with the increasing costs of production. The price of wheat is roughly the same today as it was in 1980. In addition to weather, farmers are at the mercy of world markets and a system of transportation over which they have no control. To make matters worse, the farmer's share of the food dollar has sharply declined.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To afford the inputs and equipment “required" to farm, you need to produce a lot. And to do that, you need to cover a lot of land.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On balance in Canada, we don't have anything approaching the level of subsidies that European and American farmers receive.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In fact, here, it seems, farmers themselves subsidize agriculture: More than one-third of Saskatchewan farmers depend on a second, non-farm job for extra income. And still they struggle to balance the books. Farm cash receipts doubled between 1996 and 2016 – but farm debt increased 3.5 times. In 1996, cash receipts exceeded the debt load, but in 2016, that reality had reversed itself: Farm debt exceeded cash receipts by a factor of 1.6.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“You just look at the economics of the whole thing and you know it's not right," says Kent Mullinix, director of the Institute for Sustainable Food Systems at British Columbia's Kwantlen Polytechnic University and an adjunct professor at UBC. “It's not a healthy system."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Today, even as I ardently assert the importance of the Canadian family farm, I'm the first to admit that I'm in no position to take over ours. Nor are my siblings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">My brother, James, a father of three who manages a city-government parks-and-recreation department in Alberta, has at least given it more thought than his sisters. But they have, on the whole, been sobering thoughts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As a teen, during those difficult 1980s, he wanted only to insulate himself from the uncertainties of farming. He describes an imaginary ad campaign of the era: “Hey, all this could be yours someday: the drought, the astronomical interest rates, the debt, the grasshoppers!"</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Today, he runs through staggering numbers as he outlines the money he'd need to run the family farm. And those numbers do not add up to anything he could feasibly manage. Family farming is in our blood, but our wallets tell us to turn the other way.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">LOSING HISTORY In 1986, just 2 per cent of farmland in Canada was rented. Today, more than a third of all agricultural operations rent or lease some of the land they work. Among Canadian farmers under the age of 35, half of the land they tend is rented. On the one hand, we have absentee landlords; on the other, the farmers who are, effectively, their employees, even when they live on the land.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the world of family farmers such as Gord, a “good" farmer works to be sustainable – not only financially, but ecologically: You must look after the land, the future health and viability of your soil. But in the world of corporate agriculture, farms get worked to within an inch of their life.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When we see only the bottom line, we lose sight of the need to nurture the land. And to nurture, as well, human relationships, and the accompanying human values, that are tied to the land: those involving our family, our neighbours and their families, and the broader community – all the things that ownership, and a local multiplicity of family-sized farms, have long led to.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the words of American farmer and environmental activist Wendell Berry, the “contest between industrialism and agrarianism now defines the most fundamental human difference, for it divides not just two nearly opposite concepts of agriculture and land use, but also two nearly opposite ways of understanding ourselves, our fellow creatures and our world."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I'm not arguing for a wholesale return to the old days of backbreaking work unaided by technological advances, but rather for a renewed awareness of our collective future – one that includes incorporating values of stewardship, both for the land and for the culture of community that family farms nurture. Large-scale farming has a place in this future, but we must weigh its costs against its benefits.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Gord's youth, the village of Mortlach had an array of businesses, including a butcher, two grocery stores, three implement shops, a livery and a lumber yard.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At one time, the village even had two banks and a weekly newspaper.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They're all gone now.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There were also five grain elevators. Today, just one stands – and it's closed. All the grain in the surrounding area is trucked to Moose Jaw, consolidated in four “high-throughput" elevators, the newest of which can fill up to 147 grain cars in a single day.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 1964, when Gord graduated from Mortlach's only school, it was home to more than 300 students. “Remember when we attended in the eighties and early nineties?" my sister Janice asked me a while back. “There were eight buses sitting out front of the school each day." Now, says Janice, who lives in the area and whose boys go to school there, “there's just three." With only 75 students from kindergarten to Grade 12, there are no longer enough kids to form viable sports teams. Another tradition, and all that comes with it, is lost.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Or consider this: Our family has always called each piece of land by the name of its previous owner – Harley's, Percy's, Nicholson's. Some of these people have been gone now for many decades.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Gord still carries the history and knowledge of the peculiarities of each parcel that those families passed on. We'll be the last generation who can name those fields, my brother reminds me.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And then he asks me: Who will remember, protect or even appreciate the ancient tepee ring and buffalo jump that border the Coteau Hills field, just a few kilometres from our home farm, that we so love?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“When it comes to land, if you lose the memory, the stories and knowledge of the people who were on it before you, it becomes merely a corporate enterprise," James says. And then, suddenly, the enterprise itself is “just a company that's going to farm 15 sections, with no historical context.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When you don't hear about the struggles and challenges of the older farmers who came before, you don't know or remember that people lived a certain way.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">You lose history."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">PLANNING NOW, TO HARVEST LATER So, maybe it's time to take a step back from the treadmill – call it big, call it industrial, call it what you will – that is farming today.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Years ago, Gord attended a farm-management seminar hosted by so-called experts in modern agriculture.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“They had a blackboard full of figures, and they were leaning toward the idea that unless you have an awful lot to harvest, you can't afford a combine," my stepfather recalls. “They were talking about someone who had 800 acres, and they said: ‘He can't really afford a combine, because it's so massively expensive,' and on and on. Finally I spoke up, and said, ‘Well, if you've only got 800 acres to harvest, you don't buy that new $200,000 combine. You buy a used pull-type for $15,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Then I added: ‘If you don't believe it, well, that's what I'm doing.' “Besides, he points out, when times get tough – and at some point, he notes, they always do – what's even nicer than not having to repair older equipment is not having huge payments for new equipment hanging over your head.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And when you are not as beholden to the latest technology and the debt that comes with it, Gord says, you don't feel as much pressure, when the time comes to retire, to sell your land to the highest bidder. “True, dedicated farmers won't sell their land. They just won't," he says. “Someone could offer a million dollars a quarter and we still wouldn't sell."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Gord intends to practise what he preaches: He and Nora will remain in the area, and rent out their land to farmers they know and trust. They will not be absentee landlords, and intend to keep a close connection with the farm, and those tending it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is a connection that extends to parts of their land that don't even get farmed. There is a major slough, or wetland, on the parcel of Gord's land we call “Nicholson's," whose water could be used for irrigation. But while draining it would increase the farm's value, Gord has let it be. For one thing, he says, “I've always enjoyed watching the pelicans, and all the birds, that use it."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And, it's too early to say for certain, but there is hope that some of my stepfather's knowledge and experience may come in handy to some of his grandchildren. My sister Janelle and her husband, Larry, live near Saskatoon, on the site where his great-grandfather homesteaded in 1901. Janelle works in the city, and, in addition to farming, Larry runs a landscaping company. They've purchased some fertile land, on which they grow peas, oats and canola, and raise cattle, a few Berkshire pigs and heritage chickens – all of which are cared for with the help of their two young boys. While my sister and brother-in-law have encouraged their children to go to college, the boys are already asking: If everyone leaves the farm, who will be left to look after the animals and the land?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Or perhaps there is a middle way: going to college precisely in order to cultivate better ways to tend the land. B.C.'s Kwantlen Polytechnic, Prof. Mullinix says, focuses on teaching its students about “sustainability, and regenerative, agro-ecological-based agriculture." In Craftsbury Common, Vt., just over the Quebec border, Sterling College cultivates farming methods that are suited to the local environment and that employ both age-old techniques and cutting-edge research. The college has also partnered with the non-profit Berry Center in Kentucky on a new degree program in place- and communitybased agriculture. As instructor Rick Thomas told me when I toured Sterling last spring “Our graduates don't go very far."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There is also the kind of education that we consumers can undertake for ourselves. We need to learn more about our food, where it comes from, who makes it, how healthy it is and how healthy the community that created it is. And we need to learn that convenience comes at a cost – that, for instance, farmers typically make pennies on the dollar for what we buy at our local grocery megastore. Certainly, many of us can afford to pay more: In 2017, Canadians spent only 11 per cent of their household income on food, among the lowest of any country in the world.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And all of us, even those living in cities, need to start supporting policies that help the family farm.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some of those policies are financial (for example, reducing the tax burden on existing and inherited farms). Some are environmental (everything from maintaining soil fertility to weaning food producers off expensive chemical inputs that aren't absolutely necessary). Some are educational (as simple, say, as sponsoring field trips in our local schools to teach kids where good food comes from).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Finally, farmers can help themselves by exploring new crops, such as organic or heritage grains, and new methods that require less-intensive inputs and that the public is often waiting for with open arms. Perennial grains such as Kernza (a wild relative of annual wheat being researched at the universities of Manitoba and Minnesota, and at the Land Institute in Kansas), which require fewer inputs than soil-depleting annual crops, show great promise.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">FOR GORD, A LAST HARVEST This year, the annual Mortlach Fall Supper, a long-standing community gathering that caps the harvest season, welcomed 360 attendees; that's 100 more than the population of Mortlach itself. In my youth, the event, held at the village hall, was packed with locals, and pretty much everyone who came was involved in farming.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now, many attendees come from surrounding towns, and even from Moose Jaw. A tradition built around those who owned and worked family farms – and who built an organic community on their way to feeding their fellow Canadians – is becoming a gathering untethered to the land.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But not every farming ritual has been lost, at least not quite yet. In late October, when Gord was racing to complete the final stretch of his final harvest, 320 acres of Northern Spring wheat, he (along with many other farmers across Saskatchewan and Alberta) was halted for a month by wet weather, including early-season snow. When the sun finally reappeared for a few days, drying the wheat, he was able to resume the harvest, only to face another weatherdriven deadline: With four days of combining work still to finish, he had only two days before rain was set to come in again. And his crop would not withstand another downpour.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As he raced against time, working late into the night, he called everyone he could think of for assistance – including his former hired man, who had retired. No one was available.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Then, at the 11th hour, he got ahold of a local father and his two sons who had just completed their own harvest work and were now ready to lend a hand.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The next morning, they arrived with two combines and a grain truck, and, together with my stepfather, finished the work in just more than a day.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Gord's last harvest was one for the history books.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Conservative premiers are accusing Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of “moving the goalposts" on the national plan to reduce carbon emissions by demanding deeper cuts than previously set – even as some provinces chafe at the imposition of a carbon tax.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Premiers emerged from a first ministers' meeting on Friday to say there was agreement on some issues, especially the need to reduce barriers to interprovincial trade.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Ontario Premier Doug Ford said Mr. Trudeau surprised the premiers by saying he expected some provinces to reduce emissions by more than 30 per cent over 2005 levels by 2030 – the target adopted for the country as a whole – because others, notably Alberta and Saskatchewan, cannot reach that goal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ontario says it has devised a plan to meet the 30-per-cent target, one that is far less ambitious than the goal set by the former Liberal government under Kathleen Wynne.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“But all of a sudden, we have a little surprise in the room, the goalposts got changed," Mr. Ford said. “After everyone signed on to 30 per cent, some will carry more water than other provinces. That sets uncertainty within our economy, within manufacturing."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Saskatchewan Premier Scott Moe also accused the federal Liberal government of revising it targets. “With this discussion today, that is essentially moving the goalposts," Mr. Moe said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But he would not elaborate on how he believes the federal position has changed. And Mr. Moe seemed to contradict Mr. Ford by telling reporters that the last panCanadian agreement on climate change said each province would contribute to emissions reduction to the degree of its own capabilities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Trudeau government had been counting on more ambitious efforts by Ontario, Quebec and British Columbia to make up for slower progress in the two prairie provinces that rely heavily on oil and gas production and coal-fired electricity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Trudeau characterized the carbon-reduction plan devised by Ontario's Conservative government as a step backward.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We have an approach that recognizes Canada's targets are national targets. [Mr. Ford] wants to play games with numbers. But what is clear is, we are going to move forward as we always have in a very consistent way. If anyone is moving goalposts, it's Premier <span class="companylink">Ford</span>," Mr. Trudeau said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nova Scotia Premier Stephen McNeil said he did not share Mr. Ford's interpretation of the discussion. “Mr. Trudeau said some provinces would end up doing more than the 30-per-cent target based on what is happening in their jurisdiction. Some provinces are going to achieve more than others," he said, adding Nova Scotia will probably cut emissions by 50 per cent by 2030.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Saskatchewan, Ontario and New Brunswick are going to court to challenge the constitutionality of Ottawa's move to implement its climate-change plan by imposing a carbon tax in jurisdictions that don't have their own broadbased emissions strategy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although it was predicted that political divisions and disagreements over the carbon tax would lead to tense discussions at the first ministers' table, premiers characterized the meeting as being both amicable and productive.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Alberta Premier Rachel Notley said she had to get her “elbows up" as she called for urgent action to mitigate the combined effects of a sharp increase in production of crude and a shortage of pipeline and rail capacity to get the oil to markets. Alberta has curtailed its production by about 325,000 barrels a day to ease what Ms. Notley describes as a “price crisis" that sees the rest of the world sell its oil at about US$50 a barrel, while Alberta earns just US$10. “When Alberta's oil is sold in Canada, the profit from it actually goes back to Canada," Ms. Notley said. “So it makes sense for all of Canada to be more strategic around this."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Notley said premiers from across Canada spoke about the importance of prosperity in Alberta and Saskatchewan, which is also heavily dependent on the oil sector, to the health of the national economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Quebec Premier François Legault, however, reiterated his position that opposition to any pipeline is too intense in Quebec to even consider it. “I'm not at all embarrassed to refuse dirty energy when we have clean energy," Mr. Legault said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Trudeau went into the meeting being able to boast about a healthy economy, with the release of numbers on Friday from <span class="companylink">Statistics Canada</span> that showed Canada had gained 94,100 jobs in November and the unemployment rate had fallen to 5.6 per cent – a 40-year low.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even Alberta added 24,000 jobs and saw its unemployment rate decline to 6.3 per cent, which was a drop of one percentage point.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Notley acknowledged that job growth: “But it is threatened if we don't take charge of the situation with the discounted price in oil."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On interprovincial trade, Manitoba's Brian Pallister noted the progress that has taken in place in eliminating barriers and cutting tariffs over the past two years, and that positive effort continued at Friday's meeting. The barriers “are antiquated; there is no reason for them to exist," Mr. Pallister said. “There is a commitment to work together and that is critical."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Several Indigenous groups across Western Canada are backing a First Nations-led pipeline proposal that has received the endorsement of Alberta Premier Rachel Notley and which they say would serve as an alternative to the imperilled Trans Mountain expansion.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">However, a federal law making its way through the Senate would legislate a ban on oil-tanker traffic off of British Columbia's North Coast and would quash their hopes for future development.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Such a law, they argue, would be a violation of their Indigenous rights.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The clashing interests of First Nations looking at pipelines as an economic lifeline while other Indigenous groups oppose tanker traffic on environmental grounds will leave Prime Minister Justin Trudeau facing a dilemma before next year's federal election. The proposed tanker ban has already raised the ire of political leaders in Alberta and Saskatchewan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Calvin Helin is the president of Eagle Spirit Energy Holdings. His company is eyeing an energy corridor across British Columbia's north where he says he has secured 100-per-cent backing from local chiefs. Mr. Helin's proposal turns the usual pipeline process on its head: First he designed the pipeline project over three years of talks with 35 local chiefs, and only after obtaining their consent has he started looking for the money to make the dream a reality. He wouldn't disclose whether he had secured any funding arrangements.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“You can't build a project like this without the First Nations on side, even our so-called reconciliation Prime Minister is learning that with Trans Mountain," Mr.Helin told The Globe and Mail.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Trans Mountain pipeline expansion from Alberta to Burnaby, B.C., is stalled after a court ruling said, among other things, that consultation with First Nations communities was insufficient.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The route for the $12-billion Eagle Spirit pipeline would link Fort McMurray, Alta., with a new export terminal about 30 kilometres north of Prince Rupert, B.C. Built near Mr. Helin's home of the Lax Kw'alaams band, the terminal would be only a few kilometres from the Alaska border. It faces many hurdles, including the challenge of selling the idea in Alberta's oil patch, a lack of financing and the likely opposition of other Indigenous bands that resolutely opposed Enbridge's Northern Gateway project which would have had its terminus 260 kilometres further south.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the tanker ban, also known as Bill C-48, would make the project impossible.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Notley has called on the federal government to cancel the tanker ban and amend another piece of legislation, Bill C-69, which overhauls the regulatory process behind pipeline approvals. She has cited the Eagle Spirit pipeline as an example of the projects that would be killed by the legislation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The federal government is telling First Nations to park their plans and park their economic ambitions. Really, is that the message we want to send?" she said in late November in Ottawa.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Premier has stepped up her opposition to the tanker ban in recent weeks as Alberta has faced an economic crisis because of the widening gap between the price of Canadian oil and benchmark international oil prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Chief Isaac Laboucan-Avirom from the Woodland Cree First Nation said the tanker ban would kill his community's economic ambitions. He said his people feel that as a sovereign nation, they should be allowed to proceed responsibly with the few opportunities they are presented with.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“There hasn't been real consultation. You have opposition from First Nations, industry and politicians, basically across-theboard. How did it get this far?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There is something flawed with this. There's some form of prejudice here or a premeditated agenda that isn't being acknowledged," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I want to see our environmental standards improved, even from what they are today. But to improve environmental standards doesn't mean we need to kill all our economic opportunities. We just need to be more innovative."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to Mr. Helin and Chief Laboucan-Avirom, a number of First Nations will file complaints under the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples if the tanker ban becomes law.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Supported by Mr. Trudeau, the <span class="companylink">UN</span> document says national governments should not curtail the development of First Nations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Chief Laboucan-Avirom plans to travel to Ottawa next week with a dozen more chiefs to present their concerns to the federal government.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A spokeswoman for federal Transport Minister Marc Garneau, who tabled the tanker ban, said he has met with a number of hereditary chiefs of First Nations, as well as political leaders, who have expressed support for the ban.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“No relationship is more important to Canada than the one with Indigenous Peoples and that is why the <span class="companylink">Government of Canada</span> consulted extensively with Indigenous groups, communities and stakeholders to gather input on the proposed legislation for the tanker moratorium," Mr. Garneau's office said in a statement.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Eagle Spirit has earned the support of some First Nations that had opposed Northern Gateway, according to Mr. Helin. He says the proposed pipeline would adhere to strict environmental standards and would use only partly upgraded bitumen that would float in the case of a spill.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Martin King, analyst at GMP FirstEnergy, said an Indigenousdriven project makes sense, given the regulatory and legal hurdles that pipeline developers face. Indeed, there are recent innovative models for participation and financing, including the acquisition of a Fort McMurray-area oil storage facility, which included a $545-million bond issue led by the Fort McKay and the Mikisew Cree First Nations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“So maybe that will carry some weight in the First Nations community, and maybe ultimately will carry enough weight to get a project to the finish line," Mr. King said. However, starting any project from scratch now would mean that any benefits to the industry would still be many years off, he said.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After days of speculation and predictions of the most acrimonious meeting in years, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's fourth annual gathering with all provincial and territorial premiers came off without any major hitches - or major results.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">During a press conference Friday evening, Trudeau said the meeting had been an opportunity to discuss "our common priorities, like the need to grow the Canadian economy and to create good, well-paid jobs for the middle class."</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Trudeau had promised during the 2015 election to hold annual first ministers meetings, a change from the former Harper government. But with a growing chorus of provincial premiers who oppose the federal government on issues ranging from carbon pricing to support for asylum seekers, it seemed this year's meeting was likely to feature more discord than in years past.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the days leading up to the meeting, reports circulated that the premiers were unhappy with the prime minister's agenda, which focused on trade and didn't explicitly mention issues of concern to them, including Alberta's struggling energy sector, federal environmental assessment legislation or the federal carbon tax.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But by the end of the day on Friday, most premiers said the meetings had been "productive," and seemed to feel their concerns had been heard. They all signed a joint communiqué that said they had "discussed ways to collaborate to help grow the economy."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, there was little tangible progress on any of the provinces'major concerns, including what Alberta Premier Rachel Notley called a "crisis in the oilpatch." Last weekend, Notley announced a temporary 8.7 per cent cut in the province's oil production, an attempt to address discounts in Alberta oil prices caused by a lack of transportation capacity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We definitely raised the profile of the issue," Notley told reporters. "But we don't have the answer yet. I've got to be frank on that."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Saskatchewan Premier Scott Moe emerged from the meeting to say Trudeau had made a commitment to work with the provinces on the regulations for Bill C-69, the Liberal government's new environmental assessment legislation currently before the Senate. Alberta and Saskatchewan are especially concerned about the bill, and claim it will throw up more barriers for major resource projects.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Trudeau was non-committal, saying only that he's looking forward to the Senate's work.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ahead of the meeting, reports suggested that Ontario Premier Doug Ford might walk out in protest, possibly taking other premiers with him. But by Friday morning, provincial officials were making it clear no such plan was in the works, saying it was never his goal to leave.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">However, <span class="companylink">Ford</span> touched off another small skirmish later in the day, when he told reporters Trudeau had changed his expectations on climate action by saying that Ontario should do more than cut its own greenhouse-gas emissions by 30 per cent below 2005 levels by 2030, in line with the federal target.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I'd just like to know where's the new goalpost? Where is it now?" he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the fight dwindled to nothing almost as soon as it had started, with other premiers saying Trudeau hadn't changed anything. Federal officials said there was nothing new in Ottawa's position that the <span class="companylink">Ford</span> government isn't doing enough to fight climate change.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Premier Ford put forward a plan that is a step backwards," Trudeau said. "Canada's targets are national targets, even though the premier may wish to play games with numbers. If anyone is moving the goalposts, it's Premier <span class="companylink">Ford</span>."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Quebec Premier François Legault, who is aligned with Trudeau on carbon pricing because of his province's capand-trade system, seemed in good spirits and cracked jokes with reporters as the meeting came to a close. Asked if it was strange for Quebec to find itself in agreement with the prime minister and watching as other provinces pick fights, Legault laughed: "I sensed there were a lot of people who wanted me in their camp."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Earlier in the day, Legault had said he would use the meeting to press Trudeau for $300 million to cover the costs of irregular asylum seekers crossing the border into Quebec. The province had previously asked for $146 million to cover last year's costs, and Legault said the bill is about the same this year. After the meeting, Legault said Trudeau was willing to discuss Quebec's request.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even on trade, which Ottawa had highlighted as the main focus of this year's meeting, there were few signs of progress. Manitoba Premier Brian Pallister, who'd gone into the meeting calling for a "unified commitment" to eliminate interprovincial trade barriers, emerged to report that the provinces had not reached a consensus to end limits on the personal transport of alcohol between provinces, though nine provinces have agreed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But if the meeting was thin on results, it was equally light on theatrics. Overall, a gathering that seemed on Thursday at risk of being derailed by disgruntled premiers ended with little fanfare on Friday evening. Earlier in the day, P.E.I. Premier Wade MacLauchlan had predicted that no premiers would walk out, injecting a little perspective into a day otherwise consumed by political posturing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We are not in an existential crisis in this country today," he said. "We know what the challenges are for our country. ... We know what our responsibilities are. And frankly, we know how we can work together and move forward."</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a drab, windowless room at the Vancouver Island Conference Centre this week, at the tail end of a weeks-long series of hearings that some have called a sham, there was a rare break from the formal proceedings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Three <span class="companylink">National Energy Board (NEB) </span>panel members assigned to gather oral evidence from Indigenous leaders about the possible effects of marine traffic related to the controversial Trans Mountain pipeline expansion were asked to assemble in the middle of the room to watch members of the nearby Snuneymuxw First Nation re-create a salmonhonouring ceremony.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Elder Gary Manson, covered head-to-toe in regalia and his face painted with ochre, delivered a solemn monologue that touched on his love of the ocean, his spiritual connection to killer whales and his fears about what could happen in the event of a tanker spill. At one point, he turned to introduce his young grandchildren and said he was compelled to share a phrase in his language - "thi qwum."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Have pity," he said. One of the <span class="companylink">NEB</span> panellists bowed her head and appeared to wipe away a tear.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But this moment of quiet rapture and human connection was, according to observers and transcripts of previous hearings, more the exception than the rule during three weeks of oral testimony that concluded Thursday. In fact, many participants were not shy in telling the <span class="companylink">NEB</span> panel they had little faith in the process and feared it was headed for a "predetermined outcome."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That the hearings were happening at all was the result of an August ruling from the Federal Court of Appeal which overturned the government's approval of a pipeline expansion that would triple the amount of diluted bitumen it carries from Alberta to B.C. The government had to redo its consultations with First Nations, the court ruled, because the first round hadn't been done in a meaningful way. The court also found the <span class="companylink">NEB</span> had made a "critical error" when it recommended the government proceed with the project without taking into account its possible impact on the marine environment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As part of its response, the government told the <span class="companylink">NEB</span> to draw up a new report with a focus on the impact of increased tanker traffic, particularly the southern resident killer whale and other species at risk. It set a deadline of Feb. 22, 2019. And so the <span class="companylink">NEB</span> panel held meetings in Calgary, Victoria and Nanaimo to hear oral traditional evidence from Indigenous leaders.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Complaints about the process soon followed. Why weren't any of the hearings being held in Vancouver? How was it possible to cover adequately in the given twohour time limits their spiritual and cultural connections to the ocean? "I know that this is just a formality. This is kind of like checking off that little box that's there that we were consulted," Elder Paula Giroux of the Driftpile Cree Nation told the panel in Calgary. "I hope that my words are not sitting on a shelf collecting dust like a lot of First Nations words do."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Members of the Squamish Nation were upset the panel declined their invitation to attend a sacred ceremony in a longhouse so they could see first-hand their cultural and spiritual practices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"When they're engaging with First Nations, they need to do it in good faith and it needs to be meaningful," Dustin Rivers, a Squamish Nation councillor who goes by his traditional name Khelsilem, told the National Post.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The new hearings, he said, were reminiscent of the initial consultations when "they met with us, they listened to us, but then nothing changed."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Adam Olsen, a B.C. MLA and member of the Tsartlip First Nation, testified in Nanaimo that the evidencegathering process smacked of being "watered down."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's actually quite cute, I called it the Hilton Hotel version of oral traditional evidence - the conference centre, the sterilized environment that we're in today," he told the panel.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And following a special sitting of the <span class="companylink">Assembly of First Nations</span> chiefs in Ottawa this week, several leaders issued a blistering news release demanding the government "engage in real consultation that listens to Indigenous peoples."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">NEB</span> officials have said they were unable to find a suitable venue in the Vancouver area to hold hearings in November and December. While acknowledging that travelling from the mainland to the island was a bit of drag, they didn't feel it was placed an unreasonable burden on mainland First Nations. Plus, they said, interveners had the option to provide oral evidence through recorded audio or video.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Given the number of people wishing to appear before the panel, the <span class="companylink">NEB</span> said it had to set a cap of two hours on each of their testimony. And, <span class="companylink">NEB</span> panel members said, while they appreciated the Squamish Nation's invitation to visit a longhouse, if they accepted one request they would have to do the same for all other requests.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An official with <span class="companylink">Natural Resources Canada</span> told the Post this week that Ottawa was "definitely hearing the concerns," but stressed that the consultations didn't stop with the <span class="companylink">NEB</span> hearings and that the government is separately planning further conversations with Indigenous communities in the months ahead.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Former Supreme Court justice Frank Iacobucci will lead consultations with all 117 Indigenous groups affected by the project. Those consultations have no fixed end date, and are just getting underway, said the official, who agreed to speak only on background. Iacobucci is now holding roundtables to sort out what the process will look like, and consultation teams are beginning to schedule meetings with interested communities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"As soon as you set a deadline, you're kind of predetermining ... the issue," the official said. "We've been very clear that the outcome is not predetermined."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Chris Bloomer, head of the Canadian Energy Pipelines Association in Calgary, said it is the hope of industry that the government doesn't allow these consultations to stretch on in an open-ended fashion, arguing there need to be time constraints on the process.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Somebody's going to have to step up and say, 'No, that's sufficient time, we're not going to keep it open-ended.'Because open-ended doesn't serve anybody's purposes."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Oil and gas lobby groups have been increasingly critical of the regulatory approval process in Canada, saying that a failure to build major pipelines has restricted foreign investment into the industry.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bloomer said pipeline opponents have continued to delay approvals through regulatory and legal means, sometimes pushing project start dates years beyond their initial targets. He said many other jurisdictions in the world - not just Canada - also aim to enforce regulatory timelines for major projects.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"What we've experienced is that within these processes, there's simply too many ways to stop the clock," he said. "That has not created the clarity and certainty that we need."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, the government of Alberta and other proponents of the pipeline expansion have seized on the figure of $80 million, the amount of money they say Canada is losing every day the pipeline expansion isn't completed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Not all Indigenous leaders who appeared before the <span class="companylink">NEB</span> panel over the past three weeks were opposed to the project.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I think with proper technology that we can get this pipeline built and also with proper monitoring. We want to monitor what's going on here in our territories," said Chief Calvin Bruneau of the Papaschase First Nation at the Calgary hearing. "And also we want to be involved in the construction of this thing."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Victoria, members of an Indigenous advisory committee that includes Cheam First Nation Chief Ernie Crey, a vocal supporter of the project, spoke about the need for Indigenous people to be involved in monitoring and spill response, if the pipeline is built.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"By not including the Indigenous voice in some of these plans and in some of these responses, you're missing a wealth of technical, detailed knowledge on a very specific place that needs that protection," said Caitlin Kenny, chair of the marine subcommittee.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other Indigenous leaders, however, expressed grave concern about the projected increase in marine traffic and spoke at length about their ties to salmon and clean water.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I'm really not sure if you folks can even conceive of that connection that we have with those salmon people, that it's more than a protein, it's more than a healthy oil," Chief Tyrone McNeil of the Sto:lo Tribal Council told the panel. "It's in our DNA. It's in our spirit."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Steven Teed, a councillor with the Adams Lake Indian Band, implored the panel to "remember that not if, but when an incident occurs in our waters - orcas, gone. Salmon, gone. Clean water, gone. Our culture, gone. Our people, gone."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Chief Wayne Sparrow of the Musqueam First Nation, whose reserve sits within Vancouver city limits, told the panel there have already been "close encounters" between fishermen and large freighters and worries that smaller fishing boats could get "swamped" - or capsized - by big wakes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite the federal government's pledge to protect Canada's coasts through its $1.5 billion ocean protection plan, Sparrow said the Musqueam community has been provided few tools to respond effectively to an oil spill emergency that spreads into its territory. The only thing they've received so far is a trailer containing a boom that can be deployed in the water to absorb the oil. But the boom stretches for only 50 yards, he testified.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"When our band members are saying, 'If a spill happens, what's going to happen?'and we look pretty foolish as political people when I can only respond, 'I don't know,'because I don't know," Sparrow said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Asked what impact an oil spill would have on the people of Snuneymuxw, Manson, the elder, said it would be "unimaginable."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I would carry that sadness to my grave. ... I can't imagine it. It would be - for me, it would be like losing my children."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Similarly, if the killer whale was to disappear from coastal waterways, Manson, who brought to the hearing an intricately carved stick with a killer whale at the top, said he would grieve "a long, long time."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I can't go there," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's - I can't imagine that. If a people's going to disappear, how far behind am I? It scares me."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Following his submissions, the <span class="companylink">NEB</span> panel, as was often the case during these hearings, didn't ask a single question. But Manson was reluctant to question their engagement or criticize the process.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I believe in the power of the plea that I'm making," he said. "I want them to go home with a thought."</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MONTREAL — Prime Minister Justin Trudeau managed to keep the peace at what began as a tension-filled first ministers meeting Friday but had few concrete achievements to show for the day-long gathering.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The one sour note was sounded by Ontario's Progressive Conservative premier, Doug Ford, who accused Trudeau of moving the goalposts on Canada's climate-change plans, requiring Ontario to cut its greenhouse-gas emissions more than <span class="companylink">Ford</span> had expected.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But other premiers, including fellow Conservative Brian Pallister from Manitoba, disputed <span class="companylink">Ford</span>'s interpretation of what the prime minister said behind closed doors in Montreal and Trudeau himself dismissed the charge.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">Ford</span> at least did not follow through on a threat to walk out of the meeting, which he had criticized for being too narrowly focused on Trudeau's priority — reducing interprovincial trade barriers — and not enough on the priorities of provinces and territories.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Trudeau managed to mollify the premiers by letting them talk about whatever they wanted.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Everything was discussed," said Blaine Higgs, New Brunswick's Conservative premier and the chair of the meeting from the premiers' side. "I was encouraged by the kind of no-holds-barred discussion. That's what we wanted and that's what we got."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Higgs, who had never attended a first ministers meeting before, said many of the others "said this was one of the most productive meetings they've been in for a long time."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Trudeau and all the premiers, including <span class="companylink">Ford</span>, signed onto a final communique that was long on general statements about working collaboratively to create jobs, grow the economy, protect the environment, reduce red tape and knock down barriers to trade between provinces.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After spending the biggest chunk of time discussing the oil-price crisis that is devastating Alberta's energy industry, everyone agreed in the communique with Alberta Premier Rachel Notley's call for federal investments in short-, medium- and long-term help to get her province's oil and gas to ports for shipment overseas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Alberta has been suffering from a glut of oil that has been trapped inland, away from buyers, because there hasn't been enough transportation capacity to get it out. Customers have only been willing to take it at a steep discount to world prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The communique says all agreed the federal government should invest in short-term support for energy businesses hammered by the price differential for Alberta's oil. The federal government should also invest in medium-term efforts to get energy products to market — which Notley took as supporting her plan to buy tanker cars to move oil by rail — as well as long-term efforts to build the infrastructure, presumably pipelines, needed to get oil and gas to tidewater.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I am pleased to say that the vast majority, if not all, supported what I had to say," Notley said. "I am pleased that we were able to spend more time on the agenda talking about something that I think everyone understands is fundamentally important to the economic well-being of every Canadian."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The communique acknowledged that while all first ministers agree on reducing carbon emissions, they disagree on how to go about it. Four conservative premiers — <span class="companylink">Ford</span>, Saskatchewan's Scott Moe, Higgs and Pallister — are going to court to challenge the federal plan to impose a price on carbon in their provinces starting in the new year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Under the Paris agreement, the Trudeau government has agreed to reduce Canada's greenhouse gas emissions by 30 per cent below 2005 levels by 2030. Ford said his plan will achieve emission reductions of 30 per cent in Ontario — without a carbon tax — but that the prime minister told premiers some provinces will have to do better than that.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"All of sudden, we have a little surprise in the room. The goalposts got changed," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Moe backed <span class="companylink">Ford</span>'s version of events but Pallister said there was "nothing new" in what Trudeau said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Federal officials pointed out that 30 per cent is a national target and that under the pan-Canadian climate change accord, provinces agreed to varying reductions to reach that goal. In any event, Nova Scotia Liberal Premier Stephen McNeil said all Trudeau said during the meeting was that some provinces will cut emissions more than others, not that they will be required to do so.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"On climate change, I think it's clear that Premier Ford and I differ on the matter," Trudeau said during a closing news conference. "I believe that we need to put a price on pollution ... He believes we should make pollution free again."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">Ford</span>'s recently unveiled climate-change plan is a "step backwards," Trudeau said, noting that the Ontario premier has scrapped his province's involvement in a cap-and-trade regime with Quebec and California.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Even though the premier may want to play games with numbers, what is clear is we are going to move forward, as we always have, in a very consistent way and if anyone is moving the goalposts, it's Premier <span class="companylink">Ford</span>."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although <span class="companylink">Ford</span> had been at the centre of demands to expand the agenda for the meeting, sources said neither he nor any member of his team was in the room when one of the issues he'd insisted upon — the influx of irregular border crossers — was discussed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite some of the pre-meeting theatrics, sources, who were not authorized to speak publicly, also said Ford spoke only several times during the meeting and did not bother to use his translation device when French was spoken.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Among the few concrete results to emerge from the meeting, Moe said Trudeau committed to amending Bill C-69, legislation to beef up environmental assessments for energy projects. The bill has been heavily criticized for creating regulatory hurdles and uncertainty that will scare off investors in things like pipelines.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Trudeau would not specify what changes he's willing to make but said there need to be "clearer and faster timelines so businesses can have certainty" and elimination of overlapping federal and provincial assessments. He noted that the bill is currently before the Senate and said he looks forward to any amendments the upper house may make.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A spokesman for the Canadian Chamber of Commerce said that while the group was happy to hear the government was willing to make changes to Bill C-69, it had hoped for more concrete action on issues affecting the oil and gas sector.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Phil Taylor said the premiers should have promised not to block interprovincial energy and infrastructure projects — such as pipelines — that originate outside of their jurisdiction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On interprovincial trade barriers, the first ministers agreed to what the communique called "bold steps" — harmonizing standards in the trucking sector, including tire size and size and weight restrictions, and eliminating duplication in federal and provincial food safety regimes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pallister, who has been crusading to reduce internal trade barriers for years, was thrilled to finally see some modest progress.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Each of these things on their own doesn't sound like a big deal but they add up and there are literally hundreds and hundreds of these types of impediments to our ability to do business with each other and shouldn't be there," he said.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MONTREAL — New Brunswick Premier Blaine Higgs remained optimistic Friday that, someday, a pipeline would be built to bring western crude oil to ports in his region for transport overseas. But the Quebec premier tried his best to kill that dream.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While the prime minister and Canada's premiers found common ground on issues such as trade during their meeting in Montreal, they were confronted with the harsh reality that Quebec will not accept a pipeline.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I understand that Alberta and the other provinces that produce oil want to find ways to get it (to tidewater), but I was very, very clear," Francois Legault told reporters after the closed-door meeting.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There is no social acceptability for a pipeline that would pass through Quebec territory."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Legault saw no contradiction in lobbying premiers Friday to buy more hydroelectricity from his province while rejecting western energy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We are offering an energy that is not expensive and is clean," Legault said. "I am not embarrassed to refuse dirty energy while we are offering clean energy at a competitive price."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">TransCanada Corporation</span> had proposed the $15.7-billion Energy East pipeline to bring western crude through Quebec and onwards to New Brunswick before being shipped overseas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The company abandoned the project more than a year ago, and a spokesperson recently said it has no plan to revive it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But despite the hurdles placed by <span class="companylink">TransCanada</span> and Quebec, Higgs told reporters Friday he isn't giving up.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"This is the first time I had a discussion with Mr. Legault (about the pipeline)," Higgs said. "I understand the political sensitivities. And the first process (for Energy East) was a flawed one."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The New Brunswick premier acknowledged Legault gave him "no indication (the pipeline) will be a possibility — so I won't pretend otherwise."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"But I am optimistic that if we work together with people in our province and his province and across the nation that we'll find solutions."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While he remained hopeful, Higgs also offered a warning.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The country is still very much dependent on oil revenues and if Alberta continues to suffer economically, it will hurt the entire country — regardless of how much hydroelectricity Quebec has.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He said New Brunswick continues to receive federal equalization payments, which represent 30 per cent of the province's budget.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Quebec is also a major benefactor of equalization, while Alberta remains a "have province" that subsidizes others.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Alberta has been feeding our kids for a long time with the royalties, with the money that has come from oil," Higgs said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"My concern is how will the federal government continue to pay, how will transfer payments survive in the current form? Will the next message be that transfer payments need to be cut because the revenue is no longer there?"</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This was welcome news for all those fighting to prevent the worst, most catastrophic impacts of our rapidly changing climate.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An alliance of Indigenous Nations from across Canada and the U.S., now numbering 150 Nations, warned back in 2016 when the Treaty Alliance Against Tar Sands Expansion[http://www.treatyalliance.org/] was first launched, that all attempts to further increase production of the tarsands, whether by pipeline, rail or marine tankers, would be blocked.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An entire Indigenous-led movement of people of all ages and backgrounds has been standing up to these tarsands pipelines and enforcing the ban, including by starving the tarsands of its financial backers, sometimes by even going to jail and putting their bodies on the line. Heroes, all of them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Industry chose to ignore these warnings and continued to increase production, with plans for much more. They are now butting up against current pipeline capacity, adding to the already existing price differential that heavy tarsands oil always suffers from as a result of increased refinement costs and its distance from refineries.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These production cuts are exactly what are needed and what this movement has been fighting for — to limit expansion of the Alberta tarsands.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And for those saying this will be a temporary problem that will soon be solved when Enbridge's Line 3 comes on line next year, don't count on it — the resistance to that tarsands pipeline is massive and growing. <span class="companylink">Enbridge</span> is truly in for a repeat of its Northern Gateway experience.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As for the Trans Mountain expansion tanker and pipeline project, one way or another, it will be stopped. And as for Energy East, <span class="companylink">TransCanada</span> already closed the door on that one after they saw the resistance they faced. <span class="companylink">TransCanada</span> knows it will not even be able to get Keystone XL built.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When will government and industry learn that you need the consent of the Indigenous peoples whose lands and waters these projects cross and they don't have it? Canada ignored First Nations the first go around in the Trans Mountain expansion review and is doing so again at its peril in this new, desperately slapped together process.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Just as we saw at Standing Rock, this pipeline resistance is a demonstration of the Indigenous resurgence taking place on Turtle Island (North America) and all over the world. And it could not have happened at a more important time because Indigenous peoples are ready to make the hard, life-preserving decisions that we need to make to fight climate change.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Various government leaders have said they understand the climate emergency we are living in but have done little about it, saying the transition will take time. Meanwhile, greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions keep going up and scientists tell us we have run out of time for modest measures.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prime Minister Justin Trudeau wants to build pipelines that will allow GHG emissions from the tarsands to continue to rise and yet Canada is not even on pace to meet its weak Harper-era emission reduction targets. One of the biggest reasons Canada has not been able to reduce emissions is that tarsands production has kept going up.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now let us be clear. Our target is not Alberta, communities or workers. We have said since the beginning that we need a rapid but just transition away from the tarsands that supports workers, communities and First Nations. We need government to invest in renewable energy and a decarbonized economy that leaves no one behind.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A true friend of Alberta would not help it take yet another step into the tarsands abyss and allow industry to leave behind an even bigger toxic disaster. So many also seem to forget that Albertans will be a huge victim of climate change, with more events in store like the devastating wildfires and floods they have experienced.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That's why we absolutely must and will do anything we can to address the climate crisis that our planet is facing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And that's why this movement will continue to win, for everyone's benefit.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CALGARY — Prices for western Canadian oil continued to strengthen on Friday as markets adjusted to a plan by the Alberta government to eliminate a glut of oil that has plagued producers for months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After hitting highs of more than US$52 per barrel in October, the discount on Western Canadian Select bitumen-blend crude versus New York-traded West Texas Intermediate settled at about US$15 per barrel on Friday, according to Net Energy.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That's a level that analysts consider to be normal or typical based on higher transportation costs and lower quality compared with WTI.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A week earlier, just before Alberta Premier Rachel Notley announced the province would curtail production from large companies to remove 325,000 barrels per day of oil from its over-taxed pipelines starting Jan. 1, the WCS-WTI differential was twice as much, at US$29 per barrel.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"What changed with the premier's announcement is now there's confidence that the market will be balanced with the cuts that are being made in the first quarter and the increase in crude-by-rail," said Jackie Forrest, research director for the ARC Energy Research Institute in Calgary.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I expected it would happen fairly quickly because the futures market is really set by expectations about how things will evolve over the year and, with the premier's announcement, that view changed drastically."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The province also announced it would buy railcars and locomotives to move more oil starting in late 2019.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Forrest said increasing prices for WTI linked to production cuts announced Friday by <span class="companylink">OPEC</span> and its allies are also good news for the Canadian oilpatch.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The oil price improvements came as a pair of junior Calgary oil companies announced they would cut payouts to shareholders and reduce production because of the current quarter's low oil prices to date.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Both Cardinal Energy Ltd. and Granite Oil Corp. said they can't afford to wait and see if Alberta's production cuts will result in a sustained recovery in oil prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Cardinal shares closed down 8.1 per cent on the Toronto Stock Exchange on Friday after it announced late Thursday it would cut its monthly dividend from 3.5 cents to a penny per share and had trimmed 15 per cent from what had been record production of 22,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Granite stock closed 3.5 per cent lower after it announced it would suspend its monthly dividend of 2.3 cents per share and had stopped production of about 200 boe/d after posting third-quarter output of just under 2,000 boe/d.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Although we don't think that the current pricing differentials between Canadian barrels and U.S. barrels will be permanent, we are obligated to our shareholders to protect our business and our balance sheet until Canadian prices improve," said Cardinal in a news release.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Junior oil firm <span class="companylink">Bonterra Energy Corp</span>. announced last month it would cut its monthly dividend to a penny from 10 cents per share because of low oil prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bonterra and several other Alberta oil companies have said they will delay announcing budgets and providing guidance for 2019 until January in anticipation of more visibility on where oil and gas prices are headed.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MONTREAL — Quebec Premier Francois Legault said he made progress during Friday's first ministers' meeting on his demand that the federal government pay $300 million in compensation to cover the cost of refugees arriving in the province.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Legault said Ottawa had previously offered to cover only the cost of lodging the asylum seekers — about half of what Quebec was seeking.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"This afternoon they have moved forward a little more to say they are ready to look at other expenses besides lodging," Legault told reporters at the end of the meeting. "We will have discussions with the bills between ministers and bureaucrats to get as close as possible to $300 million. It is a lot of money."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since 2017, there has been an influx of asylum seekers entering Quebec across the United States border. Legault said it takes more than 18 months for would-be refugees to find out if they can remain in the country.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the meantime, Quebec pays for their housing, education and health care costs, which have totalled roughly $300 million over two years, Legault said. He said Ottawa is responsible for the lengthy delays in the system.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I expect Mr. Trudeau to compensate us," he said before meeting the prime minister and his fellow premiers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's unacceptable for it to take 18 months before (asylum seekers) get an answer. And in the majority of cases, they are refused, because they cannot prove that their life is in danger."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Federal authorities processed 24,745 asylum claims made in Quebec in 2017 — five times more than the previous year. The pace has continued this year, with 23,595 claimants in Quebec processed through the end of October.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The province receives more than half of all asylum claims in Canada, including the vast majority of those entering through non-official border crossings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Legault said it is Ottawa's responsibility to pay for the direct costs of asylum seekers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Ottawa, opposition members representing Quebec ridings called on the Trudeau government to agree to Legault's request.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The request is totally appropriate, and I hope that the government is going be attentive to this request," New Democrat MP Matthew Dube said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Conservative MP Pierre Paul-Hus said Quebec should not be left with the bill for what he called "the mistakes and the failures of the prime minister."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Gabriel Ste-Marie of the Bloc Quebecois said Ottawa should be compensating Quebec rather than helping Alberta buy rail cars to ship oil, something Trudeau has said he would consider.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The crisis is being badly managed by Ottawa," he said. "It's Quebec that is left with the bill."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The issue of compensation for refugee costs is part of larger negotiations between Ottawa and Quebec over immigration.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Legault government this week announced plans to reduce annual immigration to the province by 20 per cent starting next year. The province wants to reduce all three types of immigration: economic, family reunification and refugees.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It only controls economic immigration, however, so it needs Ottawa’s co-operation to curtail immigration in the other two categories. And Trudeau has already raised concerns about Quebec’s plan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to a 1991 agreement between Quebec and the federal government, the province is guaranteed 25 per cent of the total money Ottawa transfers to the provinces for immigration settlement.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite its planned reductions, Quebec is set to receive about $550 million in 2019 – up from about $490 million in 2018.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Thank the bout of stock market volatility we’ve seen in the past few months. While the overall market sinks, utility stocks have been an island of stability. In fact, they’ve been bond-like in their lack of correlation to the broader market.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Utility stocks spent much of the year under pressure thanks to an outlook for interest rates to climb steadily higher in the months ahead as a result of growing economic stability. To their consternation, dividend-focused investors re-discovered the vulnerability of utilities, as well as pipelines, telecom and real estate stocks, in a rising rate world.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The investing outlook has changed somewhat in recent months. There’s growing talk of a global economic slowdown and investors are starting to wonder just how many more interest rate increases we’ll see. The <span class="companylink">Bank of Canada</span> passed on a chance to raise its benchmark rate earlier this week, and rates in the bond market have been in decline for a few weeks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The S&P/TSX Capped Utilities Index has been pretty bad over the past 12 months – the total return to Nov. 30 was a loss of 5.6 per cent, compared to a loss of 2.5 per cent for the S&P/TSX composite index. But in the most recent three months, the utilities index managed a gain of 0.5 per cent while the S&P/TSX composite fell 5.8 per cent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As for bonds, the FTSE TMX Canada Universe Bond Index has a 12-month total return of minus 0.4 per cent and a three-month decline of 0.6 per cent. Utilities have played a better game of defence in this small sample.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Looking ahead, the outlook for utilities stocks depends a lot on what happens with the economy, inflation and interest rates. The more uncertainty we see, the more appetite there may be for old reliables like the utility sector. And what if the economy firms up again and rates continue higher? If you buy utility stocks today, you’ll have to console yourself with dividend yields in the 3.6 to 6 per per cent range.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Final thought: You can buy the utility index directly through the <span class="companylink">BMO Equal Weight Utilities Index ETF</span> ( ZUT[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/investing/markets/stocks/ZUT-T/] ) or the <span class="companylink">iShares S&P/TSX Capped Utilities Index ETF</span> ( XUT[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/investing/markets/stocks/XUT-T/] ). Even after fairly stiff fees of around 0.6 per cent, you get a yield around 4.3 per cent.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Answer: If you own a U.S. stock like <span class="companylink">Coca-Cola</span> inside your RRSP whether it be in Canadian dollars or U.S., there is not a non-resident withholding tax deducted from the dividend.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Canada has a tax treaty with the U.S. that allows U.S. companies that are publicly traded to not be subject to non-residency taxes providing that they are held in an account that is for retirement purposes, (such as RRSP, RRIFs and pension plans). I will point out that if you owned <span class="companylink">Coca-Cola</span> in your tax-free savings account (TFSA), there would be a non-residency withholding tax deducted from the income. That is because a TFSA is not specifically used only for the purpose of providing income for retirement.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. stock futures broke higher Friday with the latest U.S. jobs numbers suggesting the <span class="companylink">Federal Reserve</span> could take a more conservative approach to raising interest. On Bay Street, futures also turned positive just ahead of the open as oil prices strengthened as Russia and major <span class="companylink">OPEC</span> producers neared an agreement to cut production.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Wall Street, Dow futures had been negative throughout the predawn period, but pushed higher with about an hour to go before the opening bell after the release of the November employment figures. On Thursday, the Dow was down almost 800 points at one point before an afternoon rally clawed back most of those losses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Overseas, markets were firmer ahead of the start of North American trading with MSCI’s all-country index up 0.3 per cent. That index, however, still appeared headed for a weekly drop of about 0.2 per cent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“These wild swings that we are seeing show just how unsure investors are regarding the future direction of this long-in-the-tooth bull market,” Jasper Lawler, head of research for <span class="companylink">London Capital Group</span>, said. “As far as the day’s new, a more cautious Fed went some way to alleviating concerns over where exactly relations stood between the U.S. and China.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Thursday’s losses were limited by reports that the <span class="companylink">U.S. Federal Reserve</span> is weighing whether to signal a wait-and-see approach to rate hikes in the new year. In remarks late Thursday, Fed chair Jerome Powell said the U.S. economy is performing “very well overall” although the benefits have not been spread evenly across the country. Mr. Powell was speaking at a rural housing conference in Washington.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Before the start of trading Friday, investors on both sides of the border got figures on November hiring. In Canada, the gains came in much stronger than expected, with the economy generating 94,100 positions, pushing the jobless rate to 5.6 per cent, the lowest since 1976.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the U.S., meanwhile, job creation was a bit softer than forecast with nonfarm payrolls climbing by 155,000. The markets had been looking for an increase of 198,000. Unemployment held at 3.7 per cent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In corporate news, B.C.-based athletic wear maker <span class="companylink">Lululemon Inc</span>.'s stock was up modestly in premarket trading after the retailer topped analysts' forecasts in the third quarter. he company’s net income rose to US$94.4-million, or 71 US cents per share, in the quarter ended Oct.28, from US$58.9-million, or 43 US cents, a year earlier. Total revenue rose to US$747.7-million from US$619-million a year ago. Excluding items, <span class="companylink">Lululemon</span> earnings 75 US cents a share, ahead of the 70 US cents analysts had forecast. The company also issued revenue guidance[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/business/article-lululemons-quarterly-profit-jumps-60-per-cent/] roughly in line with analysts' forecasts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Marlboro-maker Altria Group Inc. is making a $2.4-billion investment in Canadian cannabis company <span class="companylink">Cronos Group Inc</span>. The investment will give <span class="companylink">Altria</span> a 45-per-cent stake in <span class="companylink">Cronos</span>. <span class="companylink">Cronos</span> said the deal gives it additional financial resources, production development capabilities and regulatory expertise. “<span class="companylink">Altria</span> is the ideal partner for <span class="companylink">Cronos Group</span>, providing the resources and expertise we need to meaningfully accelerate our strategic growth,” Cronos CEO Mike Gorenstein said in a statement. “The proceeds from <span class="companylink">Altria</span>’s investment will enable us to more quickly expand our global infrastructure and distribution footprint, while also increasing investments in R&D and brands that resonate with our consumers." <span class="companylink">Cronos</span> stock shot up on the news. The company’s U.S.-listed shares were 24 per cent higher in premarket trading.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Overseas, the pan-European STOXX 600 - which fell as much as 3.2 per cent during Thursday’s rout - was 1.26 per cent with most sectors in positive territory. Britain’s FTSE 100 rose 1.56 per cent while Germany’s DAX gained 0.68 per cent and France’s CAC 40 added 1.46 per cent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“European stocks have rallied this morning following the impressive comeback that U.S. markets underwent [on Thursday],” CMC Markets analyst David Madden said in an early note. "The huge swing we saw in U.S. markets yesterday underlines the volatility in markets, and that nervousness still exists. "</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Asia, markets finished the week’s final session mostly higher. Japan’s Nikkei rose 0.82 per cent. The Shanghai Composite Index was up 0.03 per cent. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng ended down 0.35 per cent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Commodities</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Crude prices jumped just ahead of the North American open on reports that Russia and major <span class="companylink">OPEC</span> producers were near a deal to cut output. Brent crude was up nearly 3 per cent while West Texas Intermediate gained nearly 2 per cent. The day range on Brent so far is US$59.10 to US$61.86. The range on WTI is US$50.60 to US$52.68. Both were near the upper end of those ranges.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Oil prices found their footing overnight after reports suggested Russia was likely to contribute a bigger output in an agreement with <span class="companylink">OPEC</span> and its allies. However, sentiment was tempered by indications from Saudi Arabia remained unconvinced that an agreement could be reached because Iran was insisting on an exemption to the reductions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Crude prices fell nearly 3 per cent on Thursday when the <span class="companylink">OPEC</span> meeting in Vienna ended without an agreement. <span class="companylink">OPEC</span> sources cited by Reuters said Friday that Iran appeared to be the main obstacle to an agreement to curb production with Saudi Arabia having yet to agree to an exemption for Tehran, which faces U.S. sanctions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The terms of the cut appear to hang on Russia, with Energy Minister Alexander Novak reportedly seeking sign-off on the agreement from President Putin before agreeing,” <span class="companylink">OANDA</span> analyst Craig Erlam said in a note ahead of the <span class="companylink">OPEC</span> meeting.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"This clearly highlights the difficulty with negotiations this time around, with Libya and Nigeria also requested exemptions and Iran refusing to take part while under sanctions. This also comes after Qatar announced it will leave the cartel after 57 years of membership."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Gold prices, meanwhile, traded near their best levels in five months on expectations that the Fed could take a break from hiking interest rates next year. Gold now looked set for a weekly gain of about 1.5 per cent, its best showing for any week since August. Spot gold was up 0.2 per cent at US$1,240.38 per ounce by late morning in Europe, having hit US$1,244.32 per ounce in the previous session, its best level since July 17.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Currencies and bonds</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Canadian dollar popped above 75 US cents early Friday after <span class="companylink">Statistics Canada</span> said employment growth in November far exceeded market forecasts. The day range on the loonie so far is 74.63 US cents to 75.16 US cents, with the dollar holding close to the upper end shortly after the latest figures were released.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The loonie has been struggling near 18-month lows this week, slammed by weak crude prices and growing expectations that the central bank won’t go ahead with a rate hike at its January meeting. That came after the <span class="companylink">Bank of Canada</span> struck a more dovish tone in its policy announcement on Wednesday. Before that, markets had priced in about a 60-per-cent chance of an interest rate increase in January. The odds fell dramatically after the announcement.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The random-number generator that is the Canadian Labour Force Survey spat out a massive reading for November,” CIBC economist Royce Mendes said. "The increase of 94,000 jobs is essentially the largest monthly gain since 2012 and left the unemployment rate at 5.6 per cent, the lowest on record ."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The details, he said, were also “very constructive” with nearly all of the jobs created in the full-time category and labour participation climbing. The only sore spot, he said, was the deceleration of wages, which fell 1.5 per cent on an annual basis. He noted the report also said Alberta was a major contributor to the monthly increase, adding 24,000 jobs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“That will create more concerns than usual surrounding the sustainability of the November jobs reading,” Mr. Mendes said. “Still, the large gain in jobs will keep a January rate hike on the table for now, but we’ll need to see similarly positive evidence from other indicators and no major reversal in the next jobs report.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In other currencies, the U.S. dollar fell overnight although it had recovered to trade mostly flat against a basket of currencies ahead of the North American open. Reuters notes that the index is on track for its biggest weekly decline in about two months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The dollar has come under renewed pressure as market hopes of peak U.S. interest rates have grown and the only reason the dollar is not much weaker from current levels is because global growth concerns have also grown,” Ulrich Leuchtmann, an FX strategist at <span class="companylink">Commerzbank</span> in Frankfurt, told the news agency.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In bonds, U.S. yields were little changed ahead of the latest U.S. employment figures. The yield on the 10-year note was marginally higher at 2.886 per cent. The yield on the 30-year note was also up slightly at 3.145 per cent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Stocks set to see action</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">Tesla Inc</span> will pay a 50-50 mix of stock and cash to holders of its bonds due in March, if they elect to convert the debt, Bloomberg reported, citing a copy of the settlement notice. Tesla has 0.25 per cent convertible senior notes coming due in March. As of September 2018, it had an unpaid principal balance of $920,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A Brazilian federal court on Thursday granted an injunction blocking the proposed tie-up between plane makers <span class="companylink">Boeing Co</span> and <span class="companylink">Embraer SA</span>, according to a court document seen by Reuters. The decision, which can be appealed, forbids Embraer’s board of directors from signing the deal with <span class="companylink">Boeing</span>. <span class="companylink">Boeing</span> declined to comment and Embraer did not immediately reply to a request for comment. The legal action was brought by four congressmen with Brazil’s left-wing Workers Party, which is opposed to the deal.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">TODAY’S HEADLINES</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Trudeau is in Montreal today for a meeting with the country’s premiers. Early in his time in office, the Prime Minister enjoyed a period in which most of the other people at the table with him were fellow Liberals. But now that a string of elections have produced new governments in Ontario, Quebec and B.C. (to name a few), things are a little more tense[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/politics/article-premiers-look-to-push-trudeau-for-help-at-first-ministers-meeting/] around the first ministers' table. Most are coming to the meeting with a list of grievances, from Ontario Premier Doug Ford’s complaints about the “job-killing carbon tax” to Alberta Premier Rachel Notley’s proposal that Ottawa should help pick up the tab for rail cars carrying oil.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Also in Ontario, Mr. Ford’s government is defending its decision[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/business/article-ontario-defends-hydro-one-interference-after-44-billion-acquisition/] to fire the CEO of Hydro One earlier this year, despite the fact it seems to have killed a business deal in Washington state and forced the utility to pay a cancellation fee of more than $100-million. Mr. Ford said his government’s focus is on reducing hydro rates. Shares of Hydro One actually rose from the news, with some investors relieved the deal with Avista may not go through.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The drama in the B.C. legislature has taken another bizarre twist, with the Speaker, Darryl Plecas, promising that he and his adviser Alan Mullen will quit[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/canada/british-columbia/article-speaker-of-bc-legislature-threatens-to-resign-calls-situation-a/] if auditors do not uncover problems with the legislature’s financial books. “And if the outcome of those audits did not outrage the public, did not outrage taxpayers, did not make them throw up, I will resign as Speaker, and Mr. Mullen will resign as well," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The federal Liberal government says it will go ahead and sign[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/politics/article-liberals-tout-plans-to-sign-un-migration-agreement-amid-tory/] a non-binding United Nations agreement on migration next week in Morocco over the protests of the Conservative Party.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And a federal agency that gives out money to health researchers is itself racking up some big bills for hospitality and travel, CBC reports[https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/health-cihr-research-scientists-medical-expenses-travel-hospitality-philpott-1.4933405] .</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Campbell Clark (The Globe and Mail)[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/politics/article-this-weekends-matinee-the-return-of-political-theatre/] on Justin Trudeau vs. the premiers: “Stephen Harper didn’t hold many first ministers' meetings, and Mr. Trudeau campaigned on making them a regular thing again. Now he has to face a room of premiers who are as much against him as for him, for a variety of reasons.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
John Ibbitson (The Globe and Mail)[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/politics/article-canada-will-pay-a-price-no-matter-what-for-its-part-in-the-worsening-u/] on Canada-China trade after the <span class="companylink">Huawei</span> arrest: “Whether we like it or not, Canada is now a key player in a dangerously escalating contest for global dominance between China and the United States. In any such conflict, this country will always stand with its closest ally and trading partner. But we will pay a price.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Wenran Jiang (The Globe and Mail)[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/opinion/article-after-huawei-arrest-china-should-take-a-deep-breath-and-wait-for-the/] on what China could do next: “While Ottawa will continue to argue that it is simply following a legal procedure and defer the case to the justice system, it should not underestimate Beijing’s resolve in protecting <span class="companylink">Huawei</span> against what is perceived in China as yet another Western strike aimed at one of its leading tech companies.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Andrew Willis (The Globe and Mail)[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/business/commentary/article-doug-ford-gets-rid-of-the-6-million-man-and-costs-hydro-one-18/] on the Ontario Premier and Hydro One: “Ontario Premier Doug Ford promised to get rid of the $6-million man running utility <span class="companylink">Hydro One Ltd</span>. during his successful election campaign last spring. Keeping that promise appears to have cost Hydro One at least $185-million, killed plans to create a market-leading company and sullied the province’s reputation as a place to do business.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Denise Balkissoon (The Globe and Mail)[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/opinion/article-finally-a-meaningful-definition-of-pro-life/] on expanding the definition of what it means to be ‘pro-life’: “In both Canada and the United States, young people are more likely to believe climate science. Young conservatives might be more skeptical than their liberal counterparts, but they’re less skeptical than their parents and grandparents. And so, as they try to shake their elders out of their fossilized position on fuel, some are invoking the pro-life cause.”</p>

(“Bellatrix” or the “Company”) (TSX, NYSE: BXE) announces the planned timing of its 2019 capital budget and guidance release, reiterates its commodity price risk management protection and market diversification exposure, provides an update regarding its ongoing debt refinancing efforts, and the publication of its annual corporate responsibility report.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bellatrix plans to release its 2019 capital budget and guidance in January 2019. The Company intends on balancing financial flexibility and profitable resource development, incorporating the benefits of the market diversification contracts as outlined below.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Reiterated Commodity Price Risk Management Protection and Market Diversification Benefits</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bellatrix entered into a series of market diversification contracts approximately one year ago that give the Company access to non-AECO market natural gas prices. Bellatrix’s market diversification sales into the Dawn, Chicago and Malin markets represent approximately 55% of Bellatrix’s natural gas volumes (based on the mid-point of 2018 average production guidance). Each of these three markets has demonstrated material price improvement in concert with strengthening Henry Hub prices. Accessing premium priced markets on more than half of Bellatrix’s natural gas volumes provides a unique and differentiated advantage in the current price environment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Furthermore, Bellatrix has proactively fixed the prices on a portion of these markets to reduce the impact of commodity price volatility on our business. As at November 30, 2018 Bellatrix has locked in fixed prices in December 2018 (approximately 30% of natural gas volumes based on current annual 2018 production guidance at a Canadian equivalent price of approximately $4.33/Mcf) and the first quarter of 2019 (approximately 20% of natural gas volumes at a Canadian equivalent price of approximately $4.20/Mcf) as follows:</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bellatrix completed a debt refinancing transaction in September 2018 pursuant to which approximately one-third of its outstanding 8.5% senior unsecured notes due 2020 (the “2020 Notes”) were exchanged for new 8.5% second lien notes due 2023 (the “Second Line Notes”).

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">OTTAWA -- Political tensions crackled into public acrimony as Prime Minister Justin Trudeau convened with his provincial counterparts for what may be the most divisive first ministers' summit in recent memory.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Just hours before a one-on-one meeting with Trudeau in Montreal Thursday afternoon, Ontario Premier Doug Ford's office signalled he was willing to walk out of the conference on Friday if the prime minister doesn't change the agenda to reflect the province's priorities.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Seated next to Trudeau at the outset of their discussion, Ford said he wants to focus on Ottawa's "job-killing carbon tax," as well as the impact of the <span class="companylink">General Motors</span> plant closure in Oshawa and the cost Ontario bears for asylum seekers crossing into Canada from the United States.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At Queen's Park, Economic Development Minister Todd Smith outlined why <span class="companylink">Ford</span> was upset with Trudeau's agenda for the first ministers' confab.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The agenda ... is basically 60 minutes of the premiers of all the provinces being lectured to by federal ministers, and that's not what this should be about," Smith said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"What (<span class="companylink">Ford</span>) wants is for the prime minister to change his mind."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Speaking to reporters earlier at a press conference in Montreal, Trudeau said it is important for Canadian leaders to come together to discuss priorities across the country even when they disagree with each other.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I don't have any illusions that we're all going to agree on everything, but I certainly know that Canadians expect us to be able to roll up our sleeves and talk constructively about how we're going to solve the challenges they're facing," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">Ford</span>'s walkout threat came as premiers from Alberta and Saskatchewan also demanded the agenda for the meeting be changed to emphasize the malaise in their oil and gas industries, where a long-standing dearth of pipeline capacity has contributed to a slumping price for Canadian crude.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Before boarding a plane at the Edmonton airport, Alberta Premier Rachel Notley scoffed at the prime minister's plan for the meeting, which is slated to include presentations from federal cabinet ministers on economic competitiveness, interprovincial trade, and climate change and clean growth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We don't need to waste time, for people to take sort of self-congratulatory victory laps," she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"That means that we cut the fluff and we change the agenda."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Chantal Gagnon, senior press secretary in the Prime Minister's Office, said the agenda will include "a discussion on the oil and gas industry" as well as the "impact of struggling oil prices on Canada's energy sector and energy workers."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These issues are expected to come up during an economic discussion with Federal Finance Minister Bill Morneau, an official from the PMO said on background. There will also be time during a session with Intergovernmental Affairs Minister Dominic LeBlanc for premiers to bring up any other issue they want, the official said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The leaders were also scheduled to meet for a private dinner Thursday night at an undisclosed location in Montreal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Friday's summit is the fourth first ministers' conference since Trudeau took power in 2015 and promised to resurrect the tradition of regular federal-provincial summits that fell dormant when Stephen Harper was prime minister.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Trudeau has never faced such outright opposition at the premiers' table.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Liberal leaders in Ontario, Quebec and New Brunswick have been replaced by right-leaning premiers with policy priorities that clash with Trudeau's aims at the federal level. Blaine Higgs, the Progressive Conservative premier of New Brunswick, has said he wants to discuss the chance of revitalizing the abandoned Energy East pipeline project, a proposal to carry Alberta oil to the Maritimes that many political observers assume is dead-on-arrival for voters in Quebec. And Quebec Premier François Legault wants to restrict the number of immigrants allowed to settle in the province - a decision the prime minister questioned because of concerns of a labour shortage for certain businesses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, provincial opposition has coalesced around Ottawa's carbon price plan and the fuel levy that will be imposed in four provinces next year. Ontario and Saskatchewan have launched court challenges to fight the federal carbon price, decrying the levy as a job-killing tax that will hurt the economy. New Brunswick and Manitoba are also opposed to the fuel levy, which will be imposed in their jurisdictions as well in April 2019.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">Ford</span>, Higgs and Saskatchewan Premier Scott Moe met Thursday night to lay down their priorities for Friday's six-hour summit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Speaking to reporters Thursday afternoon, Moe said the premiers' concerns over the agenda for the summit might deter some from attending Friday's meeting, but that he wants to focus on his own goals for the conference. Those include convincing Trudeau to scrap Bill C-69, the federal government's legislation to overhaul the assessment process for major resource projects, and drop his plans to impose its carbon price and allow provinces like Saskatchewan and Ontario to move forward with their own climate plans that don't include putting a price on carbon.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"This would be a first step by this federal government in showing that they are listening to provinces and listening to working Canadians across the nation," Moe said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jennifer Wallner, an associate professor of political science at the University of Ottawa, said she laments how first ministers' meetings can get hijacked by political squabbling that overshadows policy discussions between the leaders of different orders of government. The prime minister's control over the agenda, and how it is released to premiers only days before the meeting, only amplifies the "petty" political games that sometimes get played, she said. One way to avoid this is to hold these meetings more regularly, with a clear agenda nailed down well in advance, she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It shouldn't descend into this type of absurdity."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But even though the meeting presents Trudeau's opponents with a platform to slag his policies, there may be some political advantage for the prime minister, said David Coletto, chief executive of Abacus Data.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Having a conflict with Premier Ford, for example, can play to the Liberals efforts in Ontario and really be a counterpoint to some of the policies that the Ontario government are proposing that go against the ideology and world view of more progressive voters," Coletto said.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MONTREAL — While tanking oil prices and the federal carbon tax are not on the official agenda as Prime Minister Justin Trudeau meets with premiers and territorial leaders in Montreal today, both issues are bound to garner a lot of attention.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The meeting is supposed to tackle interprovincial trade barriers, but the historically low price of oil, due to a glut on the market, appears set to derail that topic. Economists have warned the problem is having negative effects across the country, not just in Alberta, whose economy depends on oil.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some of the premiers had pushed Trudeau to put it on the agenda.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Liberal government has wanted to focus on business-tax competitiveness, its environmental goals and improving trade between the provinces, an issue Manitoba Premier Brian Pallister has advocated for nationally.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Thursday, Alberta Premier Rachel Notley urged Ottawa to “cut the fluff" and focus on the oil crisis. Ontario Premier Doug Ford threatened to walk out if the meeting doesn't include discussions on the “job-killing carbon tax."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Dominic LeBlanc, the federal minister for intergovernmental affairs, dismissed the threat of a walkout by Ford, characterizing carbon-tax opponents as environmental laggards. “Premiers can practise whatever partisan politics they want on the eve of a first ministers meeting," he told reporters. “Canadians, I think, will judge harshly people who don't want to constructively engage."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ford, along with the premiers of Saskatchewan and New Brunswick, held a news conference Thursday to repeat their criticism of the federal carbon tax, which Ottawa will impose on their provinces next year. Manitoba will also be forced to adopt the federal carbon tax, but Pallister didn't attend the news conference because he was travelling to Montreal from Winnipeg.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Wednesday, Pallister said the meeting should focus on the oil crisis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Clearly, when some of your family are suffering, you should be concerned about that, and right now we have some real, real problems affecting the oilpatch, and that affects the GDP of our country," Pallister said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The premier noted the meeting only has four hours of open discussion, after briefings from officials and ministers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pallister raised the issue at the premiers meeting in July. Since then, jurisdictions have standardized some regulations, including construction codes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The premier believes trade barriers cost each family in Canada $1,500 a year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">LeBlanc highlighted the “patchwork quilt" of provincial regulations in a speech in Montreal on Thursday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He cited progress on harmonizing the definition of “vodka." LeBlanc said federal rules used to mean vodka could only be sold in another province when derived solely from wheat or potatoes. He said that only allowed two Manitoba firms to market the drink abroad and within the province. The rules changed recently.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">LeBlanc said success at today's meeting would mean “substantial progress" on removing internal trade barriers “on a much more accelerated scale."</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Governor says <span class="companylink">Bank of Canada</span> became more concerned about state of economy when prices for light crude from Alberta began to slump</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bank of Canada Governor Stephen Poloz does not think the country has another 2014-15 oil shock on its hands, but he said the central bank needs more time to figure out how hard the current slump in Canada's oil market will hit the broader economy.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“It looks like it's material at this stage, but smaller," Mr. Poloz said in a news conference after a morning speech in Toronto, noting the industry makes up a much smaller portion of the Canadian economy than it did before the oil shock of four years ago. “That doesn't make it less important – certainly to the people who are affected."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Poloz made his comments one day after the <span class="companylink">Bank of Canada</span> held its key interest rate steady at 1.75 per cent while issuing a statement that painted a much gloomier portrait of the Canadian economy than it expressed when it raised rates in late October. The oil sector's troubles were the main factor in the bank's change in tone.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Markets interpreted the new statement as a signal that the central bank will delay its next rate hike, which had been widely anticipated for January – buying the bank time to better calculate the meaning of this latest shock to the oil sector.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We have to do our work in order to understand the shock better and what its magnitude actually is," he said. “We need some time."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Poloz said the central bank was aware of the deep decline in the price of heavy oil from the Alberta oil sands when it issued a more upbeat assessment of the economy in October. However, it felt the slump would clear up later in the year, once temporary shutdowns at U.S. refineries ended.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the bank became more concerned when prices for Alberta's light crude also slumped amid transportation bottlenecks and swelling inventories. The Alberta government's decision to institute mandatory production cuts beginning in January to reduce the supply glut, announced last Sunday, has further complicated the bank's economic assessments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“It's the effect on light [oil] that is the newsworthy item here," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Poloz noted that the oil and gas sector's footprint on the Canadian economy today is considerably smaller than it was before 2014 and ‘15, when oil prices collapsed, investment in the oil patch plunged and the <span class="companylink">Bank of Canada</span> cut interest rates twice to help support a slowing national economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The contribution of oil and gas to gross domestic product has been cut nearly in half since 2014 – to 3.5 per cent of GDP from 6 per cent. The sector's share of Canadian business investment, which was about 30 per cent in 2014, has shrunk to about 18 per cent today, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nevertheless, “it is already clear that a painful adjustment is developing in Western Canada, and there will be a meaningful impact on the Canadian macroeconomy," he said in his speech.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some economists have suggested the oil downturn could knock 0.5 per cent off annual GDP.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">Bank of Canada</span> will issue its own updated economic forecasts in its quarterly monetary policy report on Jan. 9, in conjunction with its next interest-rate decision.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Poloz said the bank will use the intervening weeks to conduct a deeper analysis of the economic effects of the oil slump, including talking with oil-industry executives to gauge how the downturn might affect their spending and hiring plans.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We'll have a lot more information by the time we get to January," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The oil market is not the only thing clouding economic prospects.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Poloz said “ongoing trade tensions between the United States and other countries, particularly China," now pose the greatest risk to the bank's outlook for the economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The United States is threatening to impose tariffs of 25 per cent on nearly everything China exports there, escalating a tariff showdown between the world's two largest economies. Last week, Washington said it would delay pulling the trigger on additional tariffs until the end of February, pending the outcome of trade negotiations with China.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And while financial markets have focused on how a trade war would weigh on global economic growth, Mr. Poloz warned that traders are overlooking the important inflationary effects of rising tariffs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“It's true that we would have slower growth, but I believe we would also have an enhanced inflation risk," he said. “I don't think markets have embraced that."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Poloz said economic data in Canada in recent weeks have been “on the disappointing side." That means the economy has “less momentum going into the fourth quarter than we believed it would," he said. The <span class="companylink">Bank of Canada</span> had been forecasting GDP growth of 2.1 per cent in the final three months of this year, but it could now be slower.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Canadians don't value our fossil fuel economy, explaining why so many are OK to trash pipelines and see Alberta tank. Only 19 per cent think it more important to pursue oil and gas development than to go green and regulate oil, according to EKOS polling. That 19 per cent figure shrinks to eight per cent for Canadians who consider themselves Liberals, six per cent for NDPers and two per cent for those who vote Green, meaning that politicians of most stripes have no interest in alienating their supporters to help Alberta's energy economy recover.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Those figures also explain why Alberta's sense of alienation is on the rise. According to Ipsos, fully 62 per cent believe Alberta "does not get its fair share from Confederation" (up from 45 per cent two decades ago), 46 per cent feel more attached to their province than to their country (up from 39 per cent) and 34 per cent "feel less committed to Canada than I did a few years ago" (up from 22 per cent). Just 18 per cent of Albertans believe "the views of western Canadians are adequately represented in Ottawa."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One-quarter of Albertans now believe that Alberta "would be better off if it separated from Canada," a number that may well rise if the Alberta economy founders, and would certainly rise if Albertans realized that they need Canada a lot less than Canada needs them. Without Alberta's wealth and foreign-exchange earnings, the living standard of Canadians outside Alberta would drop and the Canadian dollar would plummet, likely leading to inflation as the cost of imports rose. Albertans, in contrast, would see their affluence rise and, because oil sales are denominated in U.S. dollars, Alberta would be largely insulated from the inflation to its east and west.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Those pooh-poohing independence claim Alberta, being landlocked, would be held hostage if it were an independent state. Those scoffers have it backwards. Alberta is today held hostage, its pipelines east and west kiboshed by its fellow Canadians. If Alberta were independent, its newfound bargaining power would certainly cause the Rest of Canada to capitulate, and speed to completion any and all pipelines Alberta needed to either ocean.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An independent Alberta would control access to its land mass as well as the skies above it, requiring Canada's federal government to negotiate rights for, say, Vancouver-to-Toronto flights over Alberta airspace. Canada would also need Alberta's agreement to have trains and trucks cross its now-international borders. Threats of tolls and tariffs could abound as needed to chasten those perceived to be wronging Alberta, whether Quebec, which exports dairy to B.C., grain interests that now commandeer rail to the detriment of Alberta's oil shippers, or the B.C. ports that depend on commodities going to and from points east. Anyone thinking that Alberta would be unable to police its borders needs to be reminded that, for the last 70 years, Alberta's patrols have made it the continent's only rat-free jurisdiction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Rest of Canada has other reasons to avoid pushing Albertans to the point of separation. Should Alberta become a credible threat to leave the Canadian federation, the debate would likely embolden Quebec separatists, make Canada seem unstable and scare off both domestic and international investment. Alberta would have the United States as a bargaining chip, too: Manifest Destiny, the U.S. dream of controlling the entire continent, would experience a revival at the prospect of welcoming Alberta as its 51st state, strengthening America's influence over the world's energy markets and, in particular, over a now energy-dependent Rest of Canada.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While history suggests Alberta would almost surely be better off outside Canada - Singapore, Norway, Taiwan, the Czech Republic and other breakaways have generally thrived - divorce would be messy, costly in the short term and unnecessary. The <span class="companylink">Supreme Court of Canada</span> made separation plausible - separation negotiations would start as soon as a clear majority of Albertans in a clearly stated referendum voted to leave Canada. It wouldn't take too many more blows to Alberta's economy and Albertans'pride for the 46 per cent who now see themselves more as Albertans than Canadians to become 56 per cent or even 66 per cent, figures setting Canada on a path to dismemberment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The last time Alberta was pushed toward the brink, it argued that "the West wants in." The next time it might argue that "Alberta wants out." The Rest of Canada needs to understand it has no hand to play if it continues to fuel Albertans' discontent. If we don't come to have regard for the needs of Alberta, Alberta will come to have no regard for Canada.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The federal government will create a new centre of excellence in Ottawa to support aircraft testing, but it will come at the cost of relocating staff and shutting down existing military facilities in Alberta.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The move affects the Canadian military's Aerospace Engineering Test Establishment, or AETE, which has been at Cold Lake, Alta., since 1971. Under the new plan AETE would be relocated to the international airport in Ottawa and partnered with the National Research Council Flight Research Laboratory and Transport Canada Aircraft Services Directorate to create a centre of excellence for flight testing and evaluation. The move would affect almost one-third of the unit, which employs 166 military personnel and 22 public servants. The remaining twothirds would be reassigned to other air force functions, Department of National Defence spokesman Dan Le Bouthillier said.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Moving ATE will save $14 million a year and free up space for the arrival of more fighter jets at Cold Lake. Canada is in the process of purchasing used fighter aircraft from Australia and the federal government has committed to buying 88 new jets to replace the existing fleet of CF-18s.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"This partnership will streamline our flight testing and evaluation capability, while ensuring sufficient space is available for the arrival of additional fighter aircraft in Cold Lake," Le Bouthillier said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The move is not sitting well with local politicians, however.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">David Yurdiga, the Conservative MP for the area, said he'd heard about the move on Monday when it was raised at the House Commons Standing Committee on Public Accounts. DND officials briefing the committee said there had been consultation about the move with local politicians. "It's totally not true," Yurdiga said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Craig Copeland, the mayor of Cold Lake, said the city hasn't yet received a briefing from officials in Ottawa. "It's been sort of verbally mentioned over the years that there would be a re-org," he explained. "We're hoping to get somebody to brief us."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Details about the exact number of jobs that will be moved from Alberta are still not clear. It is not known how many of the air-force personnel who will be reassigned to new jobs would continue to operate from Cold Lake.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yurdiga said the loss of jobs would hit the community hard but he added that defence minister Harjit Sajjan had assured him there would be a "net benefit" to the community. "Cold Lake can't afford to lose even one position," Yurdiga said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There are so many unanswered questions and uncertainty is what the community is facing," he added.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Copeland said he had heard an estimate of 50 jobs being lost. That would be a real blow to the area, already suffering from depressed oil prices, and with a home foreclosure rate, he said, of around 10 per cent. "That is concerning to me," Copeland said. "On the one hand it's tough to see people leave our community but on the other hands, we are hopeful - and expecting - that the Canadian military's going to be investing (locally) for the new fighter jet program."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">AETE currently occupies the second-largest and newest hangar at Cold Lake, which will be repurposed for other air force needs, including the new fighter program.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The final details of the move are still being worked on, including costs, Le Bouthillier said. DND is in ongoing discussions with the Ottawa International Airport Authority regarding the location of the new centre, he added.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The costs for relocating AETE are included in the $470 million the Liberal government has set aside for buying the used Australian F-18 fighter jets, and would not take place before summer 2021.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Cold Lake location was primarily selected for AETE because of the large evaluation range nearby and its favourable climate for flight testing. AETE employs test pilots, flight test engineers, qualified systems evaluators, specialist engineers, and technologists.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Postmedia first revealed the proposal to move AETE in April 2016. The plan first started under the Conservative government but the Liberals continued with the relocation initiative. At the time the Canadian Forces said it would still use the bombing ranges associated with the Cold Lake installation but other test work could be moved.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the time, the military told defence industry representatives the remote Cold Lake location made it challenging to attract or retain people and that relocating could save money.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CALGARY, Alberta, Dec. 06, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- <span class="companylink">GRANITE OIL CORP</span>. (“Granite” or the “Company”) (TSX: GXO) (OTCQX: GXOCF) provides an update to its dividend policy.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">From September 2018, the Canadian energy sector has faced unprecedented discounts for its crude products that have had major impacts on the industry, the province and the country. These discounts are a result of crude inventory builds related to American refinery maintenance shutdowns and Canada’s lack of access to international markets outside of the United States. More recently, broader industry sentiment has been affected by concerns of increasing global supply, particularly in the United States, which has pushed West Texas Intermediate ('WTI') down nearly $10 USD per barrel since the end of October.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The recent decisions by the Alberta Government to instate mandatory production cuts and purchase additional transport-by-rail capacity are positive steps to alleviate negative pressure on Canadian pricing. However, concerns regarding continued volatility, commodity price pressure and political uncertainty over the coming months remain high. While Granite expects improvement in Canadian oil pricing through the first half of 2019, the Company also believes it is critical to take prudent, decisive steps to maximize the strength and flexibility of the Company over the long-term. To this end, management and the Board of Directors of Granite have decided to suspend the payment of dividends effective December, 2018. The November 2018 dividend, payable to shareholders of record on November 30, 2018, will be paid in the normal course on December 14, 2018.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Granite views its dividend as a valuable component to its business strategy and stakeholders, and is committed to its reinstatement when prices warrant and a more balanced supply-demand picture improves industry stability. In the interim, the Company will redirect this capital to debt repayment to ensure preservation of the Company’s balance sheet and further improve Granite’s strength going forward.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Risk Management</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the first quarter of 2019, Granite has 800 bbl/d of oil hedged at an average price of approximately $85.85 CAD compared to a fourth-quarter 2018 average of 1200 bbl/d at $72.68 CAD (assumes an exchange rate of $0.77 CAD/USD). The Company is also receiving improved pricing relative to WCS market prices as a result of its direct-to-refinery sales agreement. This agreement has the added benefit of ensuring the Company’s access-to-market when many producers are facing increased pipeline apportionment and associated pricing risks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Outlook</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Granite continues to position itself to take advantage of more positive market conditions. The Company has industry-leading capital efficiencies and operating costs, which in depressed price environments will out-perform peers. Granite also currently has approximately 200 bbl/d of oil production shut-in which is being re-pressurized by the Company’s EOR scheme. This production can be brought on-stream quickly, when appropriate, to take advantage of improved prices for no incremental capital. The Company has the flexibility to act quickly and will adjust its capital program and allocation of free cash flow accordingly to maximize shareholder value.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Management and the Board would like to thank the employees and shareholders of Granite for their ongoing commitment to the Company. We will continue to manage these challenging times to ensure the Company’s shareholders benefit over the long-term.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">EDMONTON — Alberta politicians have wrapped up what could be the final sitting of the current legislature, with all eyes now turning to a provincial election in the spring.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Premier Rachel Notley has committed to holding the election sometime next March, April or May, as mandated in legislation, meaning the campaign could begin as early as February.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But she isn't saying whether a spring sitting will be held or a budget introduced before voters go to the polls.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I will commit to ensuring that we consider all the options that are available to us to ensure that Albertans have a good understanding of what their options are before we go into the next election," Notley said Thursday prior to heading off to Montreal for a first ministers meeting.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The election will be held within the times that the current legislation suggests."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Opposition United Conservative Leader Jason Kenney said Notley's policies are damaging Alberta's economy and that the sooner the vote comes the better.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"This is a government that has lost massively the support of Albertans," said Kenney.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It would be, I think, a huge mistake for them to try to foist on Albertans as a lame duck government a budget when their entire fiscal plan is in tatters."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Alberta party house leader Greg Clark agreed the sooner the better.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But he said he wants to make sure voters see the state of the province's finances when the third quarter update on the current budget is due to be presented in late February.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I think (the update) is going to show the impact of the oil downturn, and the government shouldn't use that as (political) cover," said Clark.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Albertans should be given full information with which to make a decision at the ballot box."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Alberta Liberal Leader David Khan said he wants to see a spring sitting or at the very least a budget. He said Notley needs to show her plans before seeking a renewed mandate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"One of the big problems is they (the NDP) have not had a real plan to reduce the deficit at all really, and the debt keeps ballooning," said Khan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Alberta's fragile oil economy has been buffeted by stalled pipelines and transport bottlenecks in recent months, forcing the province this week to mandate oil production cuts to keep prices from bottoming out.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The province's economy has been slowly rebounding, but government house leader Brian Mason said he understands hard times have ripple effects</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There's no question that when times are tough, people are a little harder on their governments," said Mason.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We know that. And it's just going to make us work that much harder."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mason said the government had a successful sitting by capping tuitions, hiking payments to the disabled, improving protections for patients to prevent sexual misconduct by doctors, and passing a new long-term funding deal for Edmonton and Calgary.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MONTREAL — Premiers arrived Thursday for a first ministers' meeting still grumbling about the agenda set by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, with one — Ontario's Doug Ford — threatening to walk out if the program isn't expanded to reflect a host of provincial priorities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The tone as they prepared to dine privately with Trudeau on Thursday evening underscored the tensions that seem likely to turn Friday's meeting into the most acrimonious first ministers' gathering in years.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sources close to Ford said he's prepared to walk away from the meeting if it does not include discussion of the federal carbon tax, which Ontario is challenging in court.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And when he met Trudeau in person at a downtown hotel for a preliminary meeting Thursday, <span class="companylink">Ford</span> went right at him.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I'm glad to sit down with you, Justin, and talk about things that matter to the people of Ontario," he said, as the two sat stiffly in arm chairs several feet apart.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I'll tell you what matters to the people of Ontario is the job-killing carbon tax."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ontario also wants to talk about finding new jobs for workers affected by <span class="companylink">General Motors</span>' plans to close a plant in Oshawa next year and "the illegal border-crossers that are costing our province over $200 million," Ford said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Trudeau was generous with <span class="companylink">Ford</span>, at least overtly, even though federal officials privately expect the premier to do his level best to derail the meeting.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's a pleasure to welcome Doug here to Quebec, to Montreal, my hometown," he said. "This is an opportunity for us to talk about the issues that matter to Ontarians, to Canadians - economic growth, continuing to work hard to create good jobs for the middle class, creating opportunities for everyone."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Trudeau has said he'll discuss anything the premiers want to talk about. But that has not quelled the criticism that the written agenda is too narrowly focused on reduction of interprovincial trade barriers and gives too much time to presentations from several federal ministers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ford said he was looking forward to Friday's meeting but, after his tete-a-tete with Trudeau, he refused to answer reporters' questions about whether walking away from the table is still an option. A spokeswoman for the premier, Ivana Yelich, said, "We remain hopeful the prime minister will see fit to reflect the concerns of his provincial partners."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">Ford</span> later sat down with two of his conservative, anti-carbon tax allies — Saskatchewan's Scott Moe and New Brunswick's Blaine Higgs. All three continued to criticize Trudeau's agenda.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We don't need to be lectured by his ministers, we need to talk about things that matter for people in each of our provinces," said <span class="companylink">Ford</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Moe and Alberta Premier Rachel Notley are pushing hard for the oil price crisis to be given prime time during the meeting. On that score, Notley predicted she'll have plenty of allies in the room.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There is really no province in the country that doesn't owe Alberta to some degree for their schools, their hospitals, their roads. The fact of the matter is Alberta has to do well for Canada to do well," Notley said before leaving Edmonton.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She noted that forecasts for Canada's economic growth are already more muted because of the low price Alberta is getting for its oil in the United States and its inability to move its product to ports for shipment overseas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Notley also said she doesn't want to spend time listening to what the federal government says it is already doing to try to address Alberta's concerns.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It just doesn't make sense ... talking about things that have already happened," she said. "We don't need federal ministers to explain to us what they've already done. We're all capable of reading their press releases."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Moe said he also wants to talk about his demand that the feds repeal Bill C-69, legislation to re-write the rules for environmental assessments of energy projects, which is currently stalled in the Senate. Critics, including Moe, maintain the bill would create regulatory hurdles that will scare off investment in energy projects, particularly pipelines.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Tomorrow will be a test to see if our prime minister is listening to working people across the nation," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We have had large job losses in certain industries across this nation and some of that is attributed to some of the federal government's policies, policies such as carbon taxation, policies like C-69 that have essentially shut down conversation about Energy East (pipeline)."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Higgs said he was pleased to hear "a lot of common interests" among premiers during a conference call earlier this week. "Unfortunately, a lot of those common interests didn't show up on the agenda."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Whether it be the carbon tax, whether it be the pipeline issue and our stranded (oil and gas) assets in Alberta being devalued at 70 per cent, not acceptable," said Higgs, adding that premiers will insist that Friday's gathering be "a results driven meeting" on those issues.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Federal officials have privately conceded that little headway is likely to be made on the official objective of the meeting: knocking down barriers to trade between provinces.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">EDMONTON—Grand Chief Arthur Noskey said the First Nations People of Treaty 8 are “insulted” by United Conservative Party Leader Jason Kenney's suggestion that land in their territory could be sold off to farmers without any consideration or consultation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“When we signed treaty with the Queen, it said our hunting, our fishing, our trapping, living off the land would remain as if we never entered treaty. Every time there are land sales or when it comes to the oil and gas industry or farming, there needs to be a consultation process,” said Noskey, speaking to media in the rotunda of the Alberta Legislature on Thursday.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At a Rural Municipalities of Alberta convention in Edmonton in November, Kenney said he wants continue an initiative that began under former premier Ed Stelmach where more than 100,000 acres of crown forest land was cleared and auctioned to farmers for agricultural development.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Noskey said first nations in the area were not consulted during that process.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When questioned by media about his proposal Thursday, Kenney said, “this is not land in a reserve or treaty area, it's crown land and it's land that belongs to Albertans which is not being put to economic use.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The whole province was built on converting crown land into productive economic use,” Kenney said. “The notion that all of Northern Alberta should suddenly be turned into a park, I think, runs contrary to our entire history as a people where we seek in a responsible way to allow for the development of our resources.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In response, Noskey offered a brief history lesson.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Treaty 8 was signed in 1899, the province came after in 1905, so whose land was it prior to the province assuming authority over it? It has been our lands, it will always be our lands,” Noskey said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Treaty 8 was an agreement signed in 1899 between the Dene, Beaver and Cree Nations and Queen Victoria, covering a vast swath of Northern Alberta and parts of British Columbia.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The land in contention is in the Peace Country are in Northern Alberta. Kenney said he considered the proposal at the behest of officials in Mackenzie County.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a rare move, Richard Feehan, New Democrat MLA Edmonton-Rutherford and Minister of Indigenous Relations stood in the Alberta Legislature Chambers Thursday afternoon and read a scathing statement penned by Noskey before criticizing United Conservative Party leadership for lacking interest and insight into Indigenous affairs in the province.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Feehan said he was “appalled” that Kenney could have had such a long political career and yet “doesn't understand the relationship between crown land and treaty land.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“You have to do the consultation with appropriate First Nations in that area, that's just standard policy federally, provincially, across the country. I can't believe he didn't understand that,” Feehan said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He also called out UCP MLAs for not posing a single question to his ministry during the entire Fall session, saying, “your silence is deafening.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“It just simply tells you how unaware they are that this is an important part of our country. The establishment of our country is three nations. First Nations is one of those three groups,” Feehan said. “Any time you exclude them you are denying our history, you are denying where we are going in the future.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Not only does Kenney's proposal run afoul of protected treaty rights, Feehan said it is not in keeping with the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples that outlines a duty for government to engage in meaningful consultation with Indigenous people.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Should the United Conservative Party win Alberta's next provincial election — expected sometime in the Spring — and Kenney become premier, Noskey warned there would be a “major court case in the making,” if Kenney wanted to move forward with this proposal.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CALGARY—A city councillor wants Calgary to make an official statement of support for Alberta oil and pipelines, but at least one expert questions how effective the move would be with limited municipal powers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ward 11 Councillor Jeromy Farkas released a lengthy notice of motion Wednesday that proposes making a formal city council declaration of support for new pipelines and officially acknowledging that the oil price differential is a “crisis.” He also wants to direct city administration to review the city's “advocacy options,” including legal or policy moves or using city facilities and vehicles to spread “education” about the province's energy industry.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The mayor has spoken at great length about the importance of our oil and gas industry, but never have we formally recognized the fact that Calgarians are in crisis,” Farkas said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“There's a lot of misinformation out there, and I think the city can play a role.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mount Royal University political science professor Lori Williams said it's fair for council to discuss the issues Calgary is facing as a glut of oil production plagues Alberta, but the city doesn't have much authority to do anything concrete.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“It's not a matter of necessity. Clearly, it isn't necessary. What really matters is what would be effective,” she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Raising awareness about how the current economic situation is affecting Calgarians makes sense, Williams said, but the message needs to be clear — and she's not sure if all the options Farkas is proposing would deliver that.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I get that lots of people want to do something,” she said. “These are understandable expressions, but I think strategically, you have to actually think about what's actually going to make an impact ... And this kind of motion and this kind of language is unlikely to move the needle.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The motion will be discussed at council on Dec. 17.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Farkas has been accused of “grandstanding” by other councillors in the past with his calls for a freeze to city council salaries and investigations into closed-door meetings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ward 13 Councillor Diane Colley Urquhart said she's uncertain how council will interpret his latest motion when the time comes to talk about it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“It certainly is provocative, no question about it,” she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We are all used to, in council now, provocative steps being taken in a whole number of areas. We just have to take it as it comes.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While Farkas said he thinks this kind of advocacy is “absolutely” a city responsibility, the provincial and federal governments are the ones directly involved in getting the Trans Mountain pipeline built.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Farkas points to precedent for cities like Burnaby, B.C., taking legal action on pipelines, but they challenged the pipeline route going through their municipality. While building the Trans Mountain would have an impact on Calgary's economy, the pipeline itself is planned for well outside the city limits.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ward 6 Councillor Jeff Davison, who has critiqued Farkas's tactics in the past, said he thinks it's unlikely there would be concrete policy that comes from the motion, but talking about how the city might present a united front on the issue is worthwhile.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I actually welcome the discussion on this. ... The reality is, if you have an available platform to get the word out to, it's worth talking about.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Davison formerly worked in the oil and gas sector, and has been promoting pro-energy sector campaigns on social media in recent days.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I believe any attention we can have, even though to some degree there's not a ton we can do as a city council, we can try to influence,” Davison said. “And if it takes turning the volume up in unconventional ways, perhaps, that's fine. I'm OK with that.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As for any action council would direct city administration to explore, Davison said he'd like to hear council debate the merits of making those moves, especially considering Calgarians might have different views on the oil and gas industry.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Any time we direct administration, there's a cost, so you have to always consider that, too.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Williams said it's likely to be a tough sell to spend city money on local messaging about Alberta's energy industry, and it could be problematic to put what might be considered advocacy in otherwise neutral city spaces.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“What are people going to learn? This is going to involve money ... It's not at all clear to me that any expenditure of money is going to add anything to the discussion,” she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Making it clearer to Canadians the impact this has had on the Calgary economy, sure — put it in a form in words that are likely to enhance understanding or awareness or even sympathy.”</p>

</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Volatility in Canadian oil price differentials, coupled with the recent decline in world oil prices have caused Cardinal to re-evaluate the current level of its dividend.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">During the fourth quarter, Canadian oil producers have received embarrassingly low prices due to lack of pipeline egress. Industry is looking to truck and rail solutions to move oil to market instead of transporting it through the safest most cost effective way in pipelines. Our lack of provincial and federal government leadership and failure to act in getting new export pipelines built is costing not only Alberta, but all Canadians significant revenue and future investment in our country. This week's Alberta government announcement is a much needed short term solution but will not solve the long-term takeaway capacity issue facing our industry.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We encourage our shareholders to voice their disapproval with the Alberta government and their local Federal Member of Parliament on the lack of progress on the construction of new export pipelines out of western Canada.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although we don't think that the current pricing differentials between Canadian barrels and US barrels will be permanent, we are obligated to our shareholders to protect our business and our balance sheet until Canadian prices improve.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Cardinal will temporarily reduce its monthly dividend to $0.01/month ($0.12/year) commencing with the December 2018 dividend payable on January 15, 2019.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Board of Directors plans to review the dividend in April, 2019 and make adjustments to the dividend rate to reflect changes to price differentials and market conditions at that time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Cardinal has been designed and organized to be a low decline, dividend paying company. We work on a daily basis to reduce our operating costs, to run our operations more efficiently and to maintain our peer leading low decline rate. We cannot however, control differential pricing, especially in a situation that has arisen to the extreme levels experienced in the last 90 days.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Our priority, first and foremost is to operate our business in the most prudent manner, to ensure Cardinal shareholders retain their long term value we have embedded in our assets and in our company.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In October, November and December we saw oil pricing below our cost to produce at some of our properties. The resulting loss of revenue caused our simple dividend payout ratio to exceed a level we are comfortable with. The announced dividend adjustment will allow Cardinal to catch up the lost free cash flow and maintain our balance sheet strength.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">During the first part of the fourth quarter, Cardinal reached record production of approximately 22,000 boe/d, well ahead of our production guidance of 21,000 – 21,500 boe/d, driven by a combination of lower than forecasted base declines and positive drilling results at Bantry and Elmworth. Our development drilling inventory has materially expanded providing Cardinal confidence in both the long-term sustainability of the asset base and the future growth potential of our company. Since then, with widening Canadian oil price differentials we began to systematically shut-in our higher operating costs properties to avoid cash production losses. As of December 1, approximately 15% of our production was shut-in.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With the Alberta government's announced mandatory production curtailment and the expected pricing improvements in Canadian oil differentials, we expect to bring back the majority of the shut in production in January 2019. Taking into account the estimated curtailed volume, January production is currently forecasted to average approximately 20,100 to 20,400 boe/d.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Our focus for 2019 will be to maintain the integrity of our asset base, reduce long term debt and undertake capital projects that create long term reductions in our operating costs.</p>

Derek Burney was Canada’s ambassador to the United States from 1989 to 1993 and served as a director of TransCanada Corp. from 2005 to April 2018.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Alberta’s energy sector is hurting severely but few in the rest of Canada seem to care. What had been a locomotive for growth both in the province and the country is reeling under the combined pressure of collapsing oil prices and policy paralysis. What limited amounts of oil Alberta is able to export sells at roughly US$13 per barrel, 40 per cent below the world price and well below the costs of production. With world prices at US$40+ the lost revenue from the “Canadian discount” is about US$100-million per day or US$36-billion per year. Cuts are being implemented by energy producers on capital spending, on work forces and on production and are prompting demands by some for <span class="companylink">OPEC</span>-style production quotas that would help stabilize the market.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">All this at a time when global demand for oil and gas continues to grow. Oil production in the United States alone has increased by two million barrels a day, to 11 million, which, along with increased global production, is squeezing Canadian supply even further. Transportation costs, especially by rail, for lengthy supply chains are an additional burden.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The major problem is the chronic lack of pipeline capacity in Canada that would enable shipments to markets south, east and west of our borders. Plans have either been delayed, discarded or rejected outright by policy gridlock in Ottawa, regulatory delays and erratic, judicial activism. The only plan that is still alive is the extension of the Trans Mountain line in British Columbia. When the owner (<span class="companylink">Kinder Morgan</span>) backed away because of political and regulatory uncertainties, the government nationalized the project at a cost of $4.5-billion to taxpayers. Yet, there is still no guarantee that this pipeline will ever be built.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Earlier, the federal government had rejected the Northern Gateway pipeline, which has been conditionally approved by the <span class="companylink">National Energy Board</span>, leaving Trans Mountain as the only option to tidewater on the west coast.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A circuit judge in Montana, who had been appointed by former U.S. president Barack Obama, recently overruled President Donald Trump’s approval of Keystone XL contending that the approval had been "political” while ignoring the fact that Mr. Obama’s rejection had itself been “political” and not supported by any environmental analysis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Energy East was abandoned by the proponent (<span class="companylink">TransCanada</span>) due to the excessive regulatory burden imposed on the project and lukewarm political support from Ottawa. Meanwhile, hundreds of tankers carry oil from Saudi Arabia and other countries up the St. Lawrence River free of regulatory restrictions on “upstream emissions.” (A curious bonus for Saudi Arabia these days).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Absent pipelines, shipments by rail have doubled to 400,000 b/d increasing carbon emissions if not risks substantively. New startups for refining capacity in Canada would help but only marginally.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Strong pressure from environmentalists and some Indigenous groups prompted the government to attempt a compromise allowing for a pipeline (Trans Mountain) in exchange for a commitment to a carbon tax. But the attempt at a Solomon-style balance did not work. According to polls, environmentalists represent a minority view on the issue of pipelines but that minority has major, political influence, notably in British Columbia and Quebec. Several other provinces are now resisting implementation of the carbon tax. However, Bill C-69, now before the Senate, will only add further complexity to an already stultifying process for regulatory approval.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Major shifts downward in the pump price for gasoline will challenge any government attempt to manage supply and demand with carbon taxes or “prices on pollution.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It should not be a binary choice between one or the other but there is a pressing need for a realistic balance between the two. Given the availability and demand for relatively low-priced supplies of oil and gas, the global carbon-reduction targets inspired by the Paris Accord are unattainable by any measure. Not one G20 country, including Canada, is currently compliant so a major recalibration is in order, preferably one that re-engages the United States.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There is no easy solution to the self-made conundrum. Even if pipelines were approved quickly, it would take three to four years to make them operational.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The hard reality is that Canada is losing vast amounts of revenues and curtailing its oil production while the rest of the world profits.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The principal challenges for any <span class="companylink">Canadian government</span> are national unity, prosperity and security. Given the gross dysfunction throttling Alberta energy, the first two are now in jeopardy. Calls for Western separation from frustrated Albertans are gathering steam. Speaking in Calgary on Thursday, the Prime Minister acknowledged the crisis, described the oil price as “unacceptable” adding the market factors were “complex.” But “I feel your pain” empathy is not sufficient. The problem affects Canada as a whole, not just Alberta, and cries out for bold leadership that will break the logjam and serve the national interest.</p>

The video that appears under the attention-grabbing title features a discussion between Mr. Brown and Ritholtz’s strategist Michael Batnick on the importance of the yield curve for investors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The investment ramifications of a yield curve inversion – the 10-year <span class="companylink">U.S. Treasury</span> yield dropping below the two-year yield – should be taken seriously by investors. Mr. Batnick notes that going back to 1957, “the last nine times the yield curve inverted, a recession followed” after an average of 14 months. Inversions have also predicted equity market peaks consistently, with bear markets starting eight months afterwards, on average.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The video also covers reasons to believe the yield curve is now less reliable as an indicator of imminent economic disaster. Previously, the average yield on the 10-year Treasury as the curve inverted was just over six per cent. The current 10-year yield is about 2.85 per cent, thanks in large part to a decade of central bank monetary stimulus. The low nominal level makes inversion more likely than in the past, and possibly means it would be less relevant this time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Brown also warns investors that financial media will stoke market panic if the yield curve inverts, and he’s almost certainly correct.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The video is useful for investors in both content and tone, in my opinion.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">Emera Inc</span>. ( EMA-T[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/investing/markets/stocks/EMA-T/] ). Buying good companies when they are out of favour can be a profitable investing strategy. Case in point: <span class="companylink">Emera Inc</span>. When John Heinzl wrote a column in mid-October titled The Compelling Case for Buying Utilities While They’re Down,[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/investing/investment-ideas/article-the-compelling-case-for-buying-utilities-stocks-while-theyre-down/] Emera’s shares were trading at about $39 – roughly a dollar above their 52-week low. Since then, shares of the North American utility operator have gained nearly 16 per cent. He explains why there’s been such a big recovery in this stock.</p>

David Rosenberg: Ignore the yield curve ... at your peril</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is fascinating to have seen the stock market’s reaction to the more dovish tone from the Fed of late – an initial relief trade until the realization set in as to why the central bank is backing away from its prior aggressive posture. The futures market has gone from pricing in 26-per-cent odds that the Fed would hike three more times in 2019 a month ago to just 7 per cent currently. The odds of two rate increases next year – not including Dec. 19 of this year, which the Fed has boxed itself into – have similarly dwindled to 41 per cent from 70 per cent. ‎Some keep saying that we should ignore the curve inversion because it merely reflects a fund-flow shift from bond investors abroad out of the low-yield regions to the high-yield U.S. Treasury market[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/investing/markets/inside-the-market/article-ignore-the-yield-curve-at-your-peril/] . What a crock of you-know-what. David Rosenberg explains his view (for subscribers).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Why investors are suddenly so fearful again about bond yields</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">North American stocks plunged on Tuesday as skepticism grew about a U.S.-China trade accord, and a closely watched recession indicator broke into ominous territory[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/investing/markets/inside-the-market/article-markets-tank-amid-trade-economic-slowdown-fears/] . The U.S. yield curve, which measures the difference between shorter- and longer-term government bond yields, narrowed to its tightest point since before the financial crisis. The curve is important because short-term interest rates are nearly always lower than long-term rates. On the rare occasions when that pattern has inverted over the past 60 years in the United States, and it has cost governments more to borrow money for shorter periods than for longer ones, a recession has nearly always followed within a year or two. Ian McGugan reports.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Seeking shelter from the market turmoil? Here are some ideas for Canadian investors</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It’s not difficult to find an investment strategist counselling a defensive approach that can provide protection[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/investing/markets/inside-the-market/article-assets-to-draw-the-defensive-investor/] against the kind of convulsions seen in financial markets lately. On Tuesday, equity markets once again lost their composure as any positive sentiment resulting from an easing of global trade tensions vanished, reinstigating a global sell-off that started in early October. The vacillation between fear and confidence with little warning is itself a sign that the bull market is in its later stages, said Ian de Verteuil, head of portfolio strategy for CIBC World Markets. Tim Shufelt reports.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">25 high-growth stocks that can withstand volatile markets</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Finding secular growth stories – those stocks representing above-average revenue and profit growth and with high probabilities of continuing market-beating growth in the future – is the holy grail of equity markets. Companies capable of sustaining strong growth paths without the help of falling interest rates or strong global economic growth are particularly attractive in the current period of market volatility. Thankfully, the research team at Morgan Stanley recently released its 25 top picks of secular growth stocks for the next two years[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/investing/markets/inside-the-market/article-25-high-growth-stocks-that-can-withstand-volatile-markets/] . The research team defines secular growth companies as those it believes “can deliver strong growth, driven by forces such as sustainable competitive advantages, product cycles, market share gains, or pricing power.” Scott Barlow takes a look at the stocks on this list (for subscribers).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For bargain hunters, these two small Canadian banks offer big potential</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some of Canada’s smaller banks are having a terrible year, but there is a bullish case for these stocks that rests on cheap valuations, attractive dividends and a history of recovering from sell-offs.[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/investing/markets/inside-the-market/article-two-small-canadian-banks-with-big-potential/] Brace yourself though: <span class="companylink">Laurentian Bank of Canada</span> is down 28 per cent in 2018 and <span class="companylink">Canadian Western Bank</span> is down 30 per cent, opening a horrendous performance chasm with the Big Six – which are also struggling this year – that is now 22 percentage points wide, on average. The banks’ fiscal fourth-quarter results this week may provide some hints about whether these two banks can close the performance gap. David Berman reports.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Canadian oil prices primed to see ‘further improvement’</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Canada’s heavy-oil benchmark surged after Alberta announced its crude production cuts – and prices should see “further improvement” in the coming years, according to a research note.[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/business/industry-news/energy-and-resources/article-canadian-oil-prices-primed-to-see-further-improvement/] Western Canadian Select catapulted to US$32.91 a barrel on Monday morning, up around US$11 from Friday’s close, as the market immediately priced in the impact of Alberta Premier Rachel Notley’s plan to draw down the province’s crude backlog via production cuts. WCS now stands at around US$29 a barrel, and sells at a US$23.85 discount to the U.S. benchmark, a sharp improvement from a record US$50 differential earlier this fall. The heady days of US$100 oil aren’t expected any time soon, but Canada’s heavy crude should continue to perk up in 2019 and 2020, according to a report from <span class="companylink">CIBC Capital Markets</span>.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ask Globe Investor</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Question: When is the last day I can sell a stock in 2018 and claim the capital loss for the current year?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Answer: When you sell (or buy) a stock, there are two important dates you need to know. The first is the trade date, which is when the order is executed. The second is the settlement date, which is when the money and the shares actually change hands. For the purposes of claiming a capital loss, it’s the settlement date that matters.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For years, settlement took place three business days after the trade date. As of September, 2017, however, the settlement period for stocks was shortened to two business days. Because Dec. 29 and Dec. 30 fall on a weekend this year, if you want to your trade to settle by Dec. 31 you will need to sell the stock no later than Dec. 27.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If you wait until Dec. 28 or later, your trade will settle in 2019 and you won’t be allowed to claim the capital loss this year. You’ll still be able to use the loss eventually, however.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When you have a capital loss, you must first apply it against capital gains recorded in the same year. If you still have net losses left over, you can carry them back up to three years or forward indefinitely to offset capital gains in those years. Only losses incurred in non-registered accounts qualify, so if a stock has dropped inside your registered retirement savings plan (RRSP) or tax-free savings account (TFSA), for example, you can’t use it for a tax loss.</p>

<span class="companylink">Laurentian Bank of Canada</span>’s ( LB-T[https://beta.theglobeandmail.com/investing/markets/stocks/LB-T/] ) fourth-quarter results brought “uncertainty on many fronts,” said Canaccord Genuity analyst Scott Chan, leading him to lower his rating for its stock to “sell” from “hold.”</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Wednesday, the bank reported a “significant” earnings miss for a second consecutive quarter. Adjusted earnings per share of $1.22 fell below the projections of both Mr. Chan ($1.30) and the Street ($1.26) and represented a drop of 25 per cent year-over-year. Revenue missed expectations by 4 per cent and came alongside “flattish” net interest margins, higher-than-anticipated provisions and a lower tax rate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We have reduced our 2019/2020 EPS estimates by 7 per cent/3 per cent, respectively to account for our lower revenue forecasts (NII, other income) and higher credit provisions,” said Mr. Chan. “As a slight offset, we have reduced our non-interest expenses (NIX) going forward. Our downgrade is supported by a negative total return assumption, further earnings volatility going forward and uncertainty surrounding ongoing labour negotiations that could impact the firm’s retail banking transformation plan.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Seeing lower revenue, “tempered” NIM expansion and larger credit provisions, Mr. Chan’s EPS projections for 2019 and 2020 now sit at $4.84 and $5.13, respectively, from $5.19 and $5.29.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">His target price for Laurentian shares dipped to $37 from $40. The average on the Street is currently $44.33, according to Bloomberg data.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“With our revised EPS estimates, LB trades at a price-to-earnings (2019) of 8.2 times (versus average of 8.9 times), and 20-per-cent discount to peers (in line with its historical average),” he said. “This is in spite of a more challenged outlook for the business and negative near-term EPS growth.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Elsewhere, <span class="companylink">Desjardins Securities</span>’ Doug Young lowered his target by a loonie to $44 with a “hold” rating (unchanged).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Young said: “The seven-year transformation plan has been a lot bumpier than we initially expected: NIM could be weighed down by higher liquidity balances, NIX is expected to remain elevated through FY19 and we still view management’s goal of closing the ROE [return on equity] gap vs large-cap peers by 2022 as aggressive. That said, we could argue a lot of bad news is already priced in (8.3 times our estimated FY19 EPS and 0.8 times book value).”</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a separate note, Mr. Chan said the risk-reward proposition for <span class="companylink">National Bank of Canada</span> ( NA-T[https://beta.theglobeandmail.com/investing/markets/stocks/NA-T/] ) “appears balanced” following another “clean” quarter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">National Bank reported fourth-quarter adjusted EPS of $1.53, exceeding the Street’s expectation by a penny and Mr. Chan’s estimate by 3 cents.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Overall, we view core operating earnings as relatively in line with Street estimates,” he said. “NA raised its dividend by 5 per cent (above consensus) signifying a strong outlook; in our view.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Chan hiked his 2019 and 2020 EPS estimates to $6.45 and $6.70, respectively, from $6.30 and $6.70, “almost entirely driven by slightly higher revenue.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Maintaining a “hold” rating for its stock, he increased his target to $67 from $64. The average is $66.67.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We forecast revenue growth decelerating to 6 per cent/4 per cent over the next two years with growth moderating in P&C, WM and Credigy,” he said. “NA provided a robust outlook for F2019, in part based on the expected strength of Quebec relative to the rest of Canada.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Based on Canaccord Genuity estimates, NA trades at a P/E of 9.3 times (2019), which is roughly in line with its historical average of 9.6 times. However, shares currently trade at a premium relative to its historical valuation.”</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Citing potential return following recent share price compression, Echelon Wealth Partners analyst Douglas Loe upgraded his rating for <span class="companylink">ProMetic Life Sciences Inc</span>. ( PLI-T[https://beta.theglobeandmail.com/investing/markets/stocks/PLI-T/] ) to “speculative buy” from “hold.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Wednesday, the Laval, Que.-based company confirmed its intention to pursue Phase 3 clinical testing for PBI-4050 drug, which targets fibrosis in multiple organs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We stand by our medium-term investment thesis that still advises caution on ProMetic’s lingering financial risk and on extended timelines to <span class="companylink">FDA</span> review for lead plasma-derived plasminogen formulation Ryplazim, particularly with most other affinity-purified plasma products, other than IVIG, that we originally thought would be in active clinical testing by now (alpha-1-antitrypsin & C1 esterase inhibitor, to name two of many), not yet achieving clinical status,” said Mr. Low. “But we have long since revised our model to solely reflect on IVIG, plasminogen/Ryplazim, and PBI-4050, and we remain positive about core scientific underpinnings of ProMetic’s capture affinity resin-purified plasma products program and on PBI-4050’s well-documented anti-fibrotic activity and the relevance of that activity to several metabolic/fibrotic disease markets, independent of financial risk percolating in the background.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Loe raised his target price for ProMetic shares to $1 from 60 cents. The average target on the Street is now $1.13.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We are mindful of ProMetic’s sustained balance sheet risk – a level of risk that made its recently announced up-to-$50-million at-the-market equity transaction strategically necessary – but we are still comfortable with ascribing a Speculative BUY to PLI based on pipeline attractiveness and on our expectation that at least two affinity-purified plasma products can advance to regulatory stage and then to commercial stage in F2019/20,” he said.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Possessing a “dynamic” business model with “a lot of moving parts,” <span class="companylink">Allied Properties Real Estate Investment Trust</span>’s ( AP-UN-T[https://beta.theglobeandmail.com/investing/markets/stocks/AP-UN-T/] ) financial results are likely to be “lumpy” from quarter to quarter, according to <span class="companylink">Desjardins Securities</span> analyst Michael Markidis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a research note released late Wednesday, Mr. Markidis updated his outlook for the Toronto-based REIT, projecting two-year compound annual funds from operations (FFO) per unit growth of 4 per cent through 2020.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“On the plus side, we anticipate (1) strong uplifts on renewal and replacement leases (particularly within Central Canada), and (2) incrementally positive contributions from King Portland Centre, Le Nordelec, 425 Viger and 250 Front,” he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We also see several factors that could weigh on FFO and AFFO per unit, including: (1) lease terminations as King and Spadina is prepared for construction, (2) temporary downtime related to the planned upgrade of 468 King, and (3) potential dilution during lease-up of the commercial and residential components of TELUS Sky.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Markidis feels Allied’s balance sheet now sits “adequately capitalized” and express confidence in the “trajectory of the underlying value of the business.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With a “buy” rating for its stock, he increased his target to $49 per unit from $47. The average is $47.75.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">=====</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite facing strong headwinds stemming from the drop in Western Canadian Select prices, <span class="companylink">Canadian Natural Resources Ltd</span>.'s (CNQ-N, CNQ-T) “strong FCF template [remains] intact,” said Citi analyst Robert Morris following the company’s Investor Day in Toronto on Wednesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Management staked out a conservative ‘base’ 2019 capital budget for now while total production guidance came in a bit light versus expectations,” he said. “But the company laid out a long list of projects that could boost production longer-term while re-emphasizing its policy to evenly distribute free cash flow, after capex and dividends, to reducing debt and repurchasing stock. As such, management expects to post a per-share production CAGR [compound annual growth rate] of 7.5 per cent through 2022. Also, we expect continued strong annual dividend growth going forward.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He added: “While the 2019 budget likely ends up closer to $4.4-billion if this week’s initiative by the Alberta government is successful in lifting WCS oil prices, CNQ laid out a $3.7-billion ‘base’ budget, versus our prior $4.4-billion forecast. Total production is pegged at 1.030-1.119 million BOE/d [barrels of oil equivalent per day], or essentially flat vs. this year, and below our prior 1.137 million BOE/d forecast due in part to a step up in production curtailments in Q1’19 per the Alberta government mandate. But even at the higher budget, the 2019 production outlook won’t change as the incremental $700-million would be directed to projects that would start production in 2020 to 2024. Notably, this ‘base’ budget entails drilling only 87 oil wells in Canada next year vs. closer to 300 oil wells under a ‘normalized’ $4.7-billion budget expected in 2020.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In reaction to the presentation and the company’s lower fourth-quarter production guidance, Mr. Morris moved his 2019 earnings per share and cash flow per share projections to US$2.27 and US$7.30, respectively, from US$2.18 and US$7.49.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Maintaining a “neutral” rating for CNQ shares, his target dipped to US$29 from US$38, which falls below the average on the Street of US$39.27.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“With regard to 2019 pilot projects that could add significant future production or reduce operating costs, we would keep an eye on the Septimus gas reinjection pilot, heavy crude oil multilateral development pilots, Horizon reliability projects including an autonomous truck pilot, oil sands mining IPEP pilot, along with initiatives to reduce GHG emissions and continuously reduce CNQ’s environmental footprint in espousing social responsibility,” he said. “Also, CNQ will be largely carried for its 25-per-cent interest in the cost to re-enter a 1.0 billion barrel oil exploration well offshore South Africa with results likely in Q2’19.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Elsewhere, <span class="companylink">BMO</span> Nesbitt Burns analyst Randy Ollenberger lowered his target to $55 from $58, keeping an "outperform" rating.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“While the company’s Q4/18 financial results will be negatively impacted by weak prices, discounts are expected to improve in 2019 as inventory levels fall and rail capacity grows, allowing for a recovery in the company’s free cash flow generating capabilities," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We believe that the company offers compelling longer-term value for investors.”</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Dream Office REIT has repositioned itself into a smaller, internalized, and more focused urban Central Business District office landlord,” he said. "Downtown Toronto is a market with favourable fundamentals and represents 66 per cent of Dream’s comparative portfolio fair value, making it the REIT with the largest exposure to this geography. With a portfolio more concentrated on markets with strong fundamentals, we expect a return to positive organic growth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Our overall positive view is tempered by our expectations of below-average FFOPU [funds from operations per unit] growth and higher relative returns available elsewhere in the REIT universe. In addition, while current market fundamentals are strong for downtown Toronto office, supply under construction is at an elevated level, which in the mid-term could lead to a moderation in the presently robust market.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Couprie set a target of $25 per unit. The average is 46 cents higher.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The arrest of Chinese smartphone maker Huawei Technologies Co Ltd’s chief financial officer in Canada for extradition to the United States cast fresh doubts over the prospect of Washington and Beijing striking a deal in their 90-day truce period.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But optimism over a trade resolution faded Tuesday and, along with a drop in longer-dated <span class="companylink">U.S Treasury</span> yields, rekindled worries of slowing economic growth and sent Wall Street sliding.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Benchmark 10-year Treasury yield held at three-month lows on Thursday and piled more pressure on the market along with a drop in oil prices after the <span class="companylink">OPEC</span> signaled it may agree to a smaller-than-expected cut in crude output.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“In general, we all have the same questions we did on Tuesday,” said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at B.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Data showed the U.S. trade deficit jumped to a 10-year high in October, suggesting the Trump administration’s tariff-related measures to shrink the trade gap were ineffective.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At 10:24 a.m. ET, the TSX/S&P composite index was down 318.55 poinbts, or 2.1 per cent, to 14,854.18</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In New York, the Dow was down 473.95 points, or 1.86 per cent, at 24,572, the S&P 500 was down 43.89 points, or 1.64 per cent, at 2,655.80 and the Nasdaq Composite was down 83.29 points, or 1.17 per cent, at 7,074.68.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">All the 11 major S&P sectors were lower, led by the technology sector’s 1.93-per-cent drop.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Worries over <span class="companylink">Huawei</span>, one of the largest buyers of chips according to research firm Bernstein, sent the Philadelphia Semiconductor index tumbling 2.30 per cent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The trade-sensitive industrial sector fell 1.88 per cent. Energy stocks retreated 2.92 per cent, while the drops in the bond market pushed financials 2.51 per cent lower.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Asian markets took a beating. <span class="companylink">Huawei</span> is not listed, but China’s second-largest telecom equipment maker, <span class="companylink">ZTE Corp</span>, sank 9 per cent in Hong Kong while most of the nearby national bourses lost at least 2 per cent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">London, Frankfurt and Paris then slumped to 2-year lows as tech companies, banks and carmakers fell nearly 3 per cent.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We had this very ugly new turn and just the degree to which the market has reacted just suggests to me that they are vulnerable right now,” said John Hardy, <span class="companylink">Saxo Bank</span>’s head of FX strategy. “It think we should all be very careful. It is not looking good, especially if the S&P 500 goes to new lows.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Japan’s Nikkei had shed 1.9 per cent, closing at its lowest level since Oct. 30, with semiconductor-related shares leading the losses. <span class="companylink">Huawei</span> is one of the world’s largest makers of smartphones and telecommunications network equipment.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Canadian dollar fell against its U.S. counterpart on Thursday to a nearly 18-month low, as Bank of Canada Governor Stephen Poloz said the economy was weaker than forecast and predicted low oil prices would cut growth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Poloz’s comments were likely to reinforce market expectations that the pace of future rate hikes will ease off.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Canadian dollar was trading down 0.4 per cent against the greenback, at $1.3415 or 74.54 U.S. cents. The currency hit its weakest level since June 12, 2017 at $1.3445 earlier in the session.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Poloz, speaking a day after the central bank kept interest rates on hold, repeated that more tightening would be needed to keep inflation on track but added the pace would be decidedly data-dependent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Much of the bank’s discussion ahead of the interest rate announcement on Wednesday had been focused on oil, he said. Prices for crude, one of Canada’s main exports, are sinking amid a supply glut and this is hurting Alberta, the western province which is home to the domestic industry.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Canada’s trade deficit widened in October to $1.17-billion, as both imports and exports dipped, <span class="companylink">Statistics Canada</span> said on Thursday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The unexpectedly large widening of the trade deficit in October is a sign of things to come, with continued falls in energy prices in November set to cause export values to decline further,” Stephen Brown, senior Canada economist at Capital Economics, said in a note.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Oil tumbled in a volatile session on Thursday after <span class="companylink">OPEC</span> signaled it may agree to a smaller output cut than expected and as concern over the economic impact of trade tensions hit global stock markets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (<span class="companylink">OPEC</span>) is meeting in Vienna to decide its production policy in coordination with non-OPEC producers including Russia, Oman and Kazakhstan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Expectations had been for a joint cut of between 1 and 1.4 million barrels per day (bpd), until Saudi energy minister Khalid al-Falih said before the meeting that the “OPEC+” group would be happy with a cut of just 1 million bpd.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Brent crude futures was down $1.41 on the day to $60.15 a barrel, having hit a session low of $58.36, while U.S. futures were down $1.38 to $51.51 a barrel.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The two have lost 30 per cent in value this quarter alone.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Overall, this shows the weak momentum in the market right now and it has clearly not been helped by what has happened over night ... with the sell-off in stocks and weakness in bond yields,” <span class="companylink">Saxo Bank</span> senior manager Ole Hansen said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“But (<span class="companylink">OPEC</span>) know how to handle markets. They might be talking it down and then delivering a sucker-punch a bit later, that could also be the outcome.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Led by Saudi Arabia, <span class="companylink">OPEC</span>’s crude oil production has risen by 4.1 per cent since mid-2018, to 33.31 million bpd.</p>

<span class="companylink">OPEC</span> begins a meeting today that is expected to see the cartel and its oil allies agree to a production cut of at least 1 million barrels a day.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That’s because the oil and gas sector’s contribution to the economy has been cut nearly in half since 2014 – to 3.5 per cent of GDP from 6 per cent, The Globe and Mail’s Barrie McKenna reports.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">All is far from well between Rachel Notley's Alberta government and Justin Trudeau's Liberals. With the prime minister in the eye of the storm over the failure to get more oil to tidewater, no federal gesture between now and next fall's election is likely to really lower the temperature between the two capitals.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The combination - within a space of six months next year - of an Alberta and a federal election probably guarantees that the rhetoric between the two capitals will become more heated.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But those who expect that the federal vote will wash away the clouds should think again.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For months now, the trend in the voting-intention polls has pointed to a Conservative sweep of Alberta next fall.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A Liberal victory would almost certainly see the province consigned to the opposition benches, with no voice within the federal government.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And that would only exacerbate the current frustrations with Ottawa.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the alternative is not necessarily promising of a more harmonious climate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Anyone who expects a Conservative victory to result in peace or even decisive action on the pipeline front is almost certainly in for a disappointment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For all the talk among Conservatives about Trudeau messing up the file, Stephen Harper - had he been re-elected as prime minister in 2015 - would have faced many of the same roadblocks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Northern Gateway pipeline green lit by his government over its last term in office was anything but a done deal. The controversial project was mired in litigation. Shortly after Harper left office, a court overturned his approval of the pipeline.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Instead of scrapping the project as Trudeau did, a Conservative government would probably have appealed the decision and, in the end, the Supreme Court would have had the last word.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But there is no guarantee that the top court would not have doubled down on the original ruling and ordered the government to more properly acquit itself of its duty to consult the Indigenous communities affected by the pipeline. No federal government is exempt from the rule of law. The duty to consult is part of Canada's constitutional framework. There is no opting out of it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The notwithstanding clause only applies to some sections of the Charter of Rights and Freedoms. It is not a get-out-of-jail card at the disposal of governments looking for a way to ignore any inconvenient court ruling.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When it comes to dealing with landmark cases, the Supreme Court tends - to put it politely - to proceed at a measured pace. It would probably have taken 18 months to two years to secure a definitive ruling on Northern Gateway.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That same timeline would have attended an appeal by the Trudeau government of the more recent Trans Mountain court ruling - again with no guarantee that the outcome would have cleared the way to an immediate resumption of the expansion rather than to a court-ordered return to the drawing board.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Any government - Liberal or Conservative - looking to meet the court requirements rather than to challenge them would have to avoid shortcuts liable to bring about a new round of litigation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By the same token, a federal Conservative government could hardly have prevented the replacement in Victoria of a pipeline-friendly B.C. Liberal government with one led by the NDP.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Premier John Horgan is within his rights to test the extent of his government's power to limit the oil that transits through the province in court just as Saskatchewan, Ontario, New Brunswick and Manitoba are entitled to challenge the federal carbon tax.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Were the federal government to start to retaliate financially against provinces for exercising their legal options, a major unity crisis would be the likely result.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The hurdles standing in the way of more pipelines are hardly unique to Canada.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the U.S, where no one would accuse the current administration of being anti-pipeline or even in the least concerned over the impact of fossil fuels on climate change, a Montana court has just put the brakes on the Keystone XL project.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Trudeau's Liberals are counting on shovels eventually hitting the ground on the Trans Mountain expansion site to prove their Alberta critics wrong. But even that is unlikely to buy peace on the carbon tax front.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That much-vilified federal measure is becoming a lightning rod of dislike for Trudeau himself, and recent events in France are demonstrating that it could have the potential to ignite a populist protest movement.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Over on the Conservative side, the commitment to do away with the carbon tax would not speed up the construction of new pipelines by a single day. A government led by Andrew Scheer would soon discover that steamrolling the opposition in some key provincial quarters to its pipeline ambitions was easier said than actually done.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One way or another, federal-provincial peace is unlikely to be on next fall's ballot.</p>

Mr. Harper had much more love for the natural resources underneath Alberta's ground than for the natural wonders that rose above it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The scale of environmental despoliation involved by theoilsands is of Anthropocene proportions and no one knows how all those abandoned oil wells are going to be capped and cleaned up. Our manufacturing base is shrinking, and we must join countries like Germany and even China by switching to production that relies on renewable energy.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Calgary-based oilsands producer announced Wednesday a 2019 base budget of $3.7 billion, below its "normalized" range of $4.7 billion to $5 billion and about 20 per cent less than this year's $4.6 billion.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Our capital program is very flexible and we can curtail capital spending down to the $3.1 billion range and still keep production flat," president Tim McKay said during a webcast from the company's investor day in Toronto following the announcement.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Should prices improve and stabilize, and we see clarity on market access, we would look to increase our capital to approximately $4.4 billion."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 2019 budget contains $600 million for long-term growth projects, including the completion of the 40,000-barrel-per-day steam-driven Kirby North oilsands project (expected to deliver first oil in late 2019) and building additional multi-well pads at Canadian Natural's Primrose thermal heavy oil project in northern Alberta.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer knows political correctness when he sees it. Lamentably, in his rush to condemn it, he sometimes forgets to pay attention to facts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Recently, Mr. Scheer lustily condemned comments made by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau at the recent G20 summit in Buenos Aires. During a news conference, Mr. Trudeau talked about the negative social consequences that accompany mostly male construction camps in rural or remote regions.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“There are gender impacts when you bring construction workers into a rural area," Mr. Trudeau said at a news conference at the G20.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Trudeau was assailed for his comments. The Toronto Sun newspaper lambasted Mr. Trudeau for an unacceptable “smear" on blue-collar workers. Sarah Michel, a waitress from Grande Prairie, Alta., posted a video defending the men who work in the oilpatch.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But none of those attacks matched the vitriol of Mr. Scheer's official <span class="companylink">Twitter</span> feed. “This is political correctness at its most ridiculous," he posted. “The impacts of construction workers building things are prosperity and strong families. They should be celebrated, not demonized.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I guess when you inherit family wealth you have the luxury to make such idiotic statements."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the rush to condemn Mr. Trudeau, however, his detractors seemed to have forgotten to do one thing: a simple <span class="companylink">Google</span> search would have found countless stories, studies and official government inquiries from all over the world describing the phenomenon Mr. Trudeau mentioned.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2017, a report from two British Columbia First Nations, supported by the provincial government, linked pipeline construction “man camps" to higher rates of sexual assault, family violence, substance abuse and higher rates of sexually transmitted diseases.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Similar studies have found the same negative social consequences across Alberta's oilpatch. And in western North Dakota's oil fields, over the past three years authorities have been combating one of the most successful, and reportedly profitable, commercial child sex rings in North America.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Manitobans hardly have to look east or south to find similar stories.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This past year, Manitobans learned about the legacy of racism and sexual violence that accompanied <span class="companylink">Manitoba Hydro</span> work camps in northern Manitoba, crimes that remarkably had never been reported to police.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When you consider this extensive body of evidence, it certainly seems fair to ask Mr. Scheer and others who share his perspective how they would explain the sexual violence that erupts whenever large numbers of men are stockpiled in work camps in rural or remote locations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, did Mr. Trudeau unjustly tar all construction workers with the same negative brush? There are no doubt many good men who work in these construction camps, men who never indulged their darkest fantasies simply because they were bored and lonely.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">However, as is the case with almost all forms of sexual violence, the men who harm women benefit when good men do nothing to stop the crimes committed by their fellow workers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A reputation is a valuable commodity, and all of us should be allowed to defend our reputations against spurious attacks. However, common decency dictates that we must never put the issue of reputation above the safety and well-being of human beings who are exposed to systemic violence and abuse simply because of their gender.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On the other hand, if you work hard enough at ignoring the plight of the women who have the misfortune of working too close to man camps, you have the luxury of making idiotic statements.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">British Columbia’s new climate action plan proposes sweeping changes that will touch every part of the economy from home heating to heavy transportation, using the province’s abundant supply of clean hydro-electric power to help shift individuals and industry off their reliance on the fossil fuels that currently make up two-thirds of B.C.'s energy consumption.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Details of the rebates and tax credits aimed at spurring the change will not be released until budget day in February, but Premier John Horgan says his province is now back on track to cut greenhouse gas emissions in line with Canada’s international commitments on climate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The challenges of climate change are clearly global, but the impacts are being felt here,” Mr. Horgan said, pointing to the province’s recent record-breaking forest fires and to communities battling both floods and drought.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A decade after B.C. rolled out North America’s first broad-based carbon tax, the NDP government has committed to a string of increases to the levy. The strategy announced on Wednesday supplements that tax policy with incentives designed to accelerate a shift to a low-carbon economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The plan aims to cut almost 19 million tonnes of GHG emissions annually from transportation, industry and buildings by the year 2030. The rising carbon tax will be used in part to help B.C. industries become global leaders in low-carbon energy and commodities. The building code will be revised to ensure new energy-efficient designs. Infrastructure to support zero-emission vehicles will be expanded. And new power transmission lines will offer heavy polluters the opportunity to convert to cleaner energy for production.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That still leaves the province looking for another six million tonnes of GHGs to cut in order to meet its 2030 targets; a second phase of the plan will be rolled out over the next two years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even with the construction of the massive Site C dam under way, the shift to electricity to power cars, homes and industry means B.C. will need additional sources of clean power.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Horgan promised the plan will be affordable for families, and that the province’s climate action tax credits for low-income families will be expanded over time to take the sting out of the planned increases to the B.C. carbon tax.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The provincial budget will include a major expansion of incentives designed to encourage homeowners to swap out fossil-fuel heating sources for electric heat pumps, and to improve conservation by replacing poorly sealed windows, for example, with more energy-efficient models.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Industry will be offered a chance to reclaim their carbon taxes if they can meet or beat world standards for low carbon emissions within each sector, which would allow B.C. to brand its exports – from forestry and energy to concrete and minerals – with an ecofriendly label.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Horgan will arrive in Montreal on Friday at the First Ministers’ meeting ready to defend his new climate action plan. He is one of a shrinking number of premiers still working with Prime Minister Justin Trudeau to put a price on carbon pollution.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ontario, Saskatchewan, Manitoba and New Brunswick have aligned against the broad-based federal carbon tax, while Alberta has frozen plans because of the lack of progress on new oil pipeline capacity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Horgan said he has already heard some push-back during a conference call with the other premiers on Monday. “There wasn’t a resounding amount of enthusiasm for carbon pricing, which is something we believe is foundational to a successful plan, so we’ll see how provinces like Ontario and Saskatchewan respond to that," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I think B.C. has a solid plan; it’s great to see them being so ambitious,” federal Environment Minister Catherine McKenna said in an interview. She noted the province has the fastest growing clean-technology sector. Ms. McKenna said there are plenty of opportunities for federal backing through its infrastructure bank and other funding mechanisms to support the industrial electrification that the plan proposes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In B.C., the climate plan was met with applause by both the environmental movement and the business community.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“By leveraging our low-carbon assets, including renewable hydroelectricity, British Columbia can play an out-sized role in reducing global climate impacts in high-emission jurisdictions, while building a competitive and innovative economy for British Columbians and reducing emissions here at home,” Greg D’Avignon, president of the Business Council of B.C., said in a statement.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“British Columbians should be excited,” said Clean Energy Canada’s Merran Smith, who served as co-chair of the advisory board that helped draft the plan. "Electric cars, more efficient homes: don’t think of these as green alternatives – think of them as upgrades. The B.C. government is helping British Columbians transition to better versions of the same thing with a smaller carbon footprint – not to mention a lower monthly energy bill.”</p>

</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In late October, when the <span class="companylink">Bank of Canada</span> raised its key interest rate a quarter of a percentage point to 1.75 per cent, the central bank sounded upbeat about Canada's economic prospects. The economy was running very near full capacity – and might have even exceeded its sustainable capacity level, Mr. Poloz said. The conclusion of Canada's trade negotiations with the United States and Mexico had removed a huge uncertainty hanging over the economy, clearing the way for a new wave of business investment and export growth. In light of the economic health, the bank signalled that it wanted to move rates considerably higher, and possibly faster, too.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By contrast, Wednesday's stand-pat rate announcement was a distinct downer. The tone of confidence has been replaced by caution, even outright worry. So much so that the financial markets, upon reading the bank's words, beat a hasty retreat from their rate-increase expectations, both for the near term and for next year as a whole.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What changed so much in six weeks?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Well, in a word: oil. For the second time in Mr. Poloz's tenure as head of the <span class="companylink">Bank of Canada</span>, a severe slump in prices for Alberta crude have thrown the Governor for a policy-setting loop.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The previous time the <span class="companylink">Bank of Canada</span> had to deal with a severe price slump in the oil patch, at the end of 2014, Mr. Poloz's response was to stun the markets with an utterly unexpected rate cut in January, 2015. He followed that with a second cut six months later.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now, 2018 is not 2014, and the current oil downturn almost certainly isn't as severe and economically damaging as that episode was. No one thinks Mr. Poloz is preparing to cut rates again to ease the economic pain of this latest slump. Yet, the mere fact that the bank's rate announcement referred to the current situation as an “oil price shock" – the same language used to describe the 2014 crude crash – underlines how this turn of events has shaken Mr. Poloz and his colleagues.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One could certainly ask what took them so long. The price for Western Canadian Select, the benchmark Alberta oil grade, has been generally in decline since summer; when the central bank issued its quarterly economic projections in October, the price was around US$20 a barrel.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet, oil didn't even get a mention in the October rate-cut announcement. For Mr. Poloz, who has preached a risk-management approach to monetary policy from Day 1, this was a pretty big risk to have overlooked.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, the Alberta government's decision to enforce mandatory oil production cuts to address the province's price-crushing supply glut, which it announced last Sunday, instantly ratcheted up the concern for the central bank. Those cuts, as the bank noted in its rate announcement, will “materially" weaken output in the sector – which, in turn, will put a meaningful dent in Canada's economic growth, especially early next year when the production cuts go into effect.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But let's remember that oil and gas extraction and related support activities accounted for only about 6 per cent of Canada's GDP last year. It's big enough that we'll feel a slowdown in the sector, but not so big that the rest of the economy can't overcome it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By the central bank's own reckoning, non-energy business investment should bounce back from a sluggish third quarter, now that the uncertainty stemming from the North American trade negotiations has been removed and the federal government has introduced tax breaks for business investments. And let's not forget that oil has an oversized impact on the Canadian dollar – which means that even as low oil prices weigh on the energy sector and Alberta's economy, the resulting weaker currency will help stimulate further export growth across the broader economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It should be noted that the Alberta government's announcement came pretty late in the game in the central bank's rate deliberations. There was certainly time to work itself into the text of the rate announcement, but almost certainly not enough time for any detailed analysis by the bank's economic team.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In that context, it could be that the true goal in the bank's shift in its message was to kick the market's expectations for the next rate hike a bit further down the road and buy itself some time to analyze the impact of the oil market developments and let them play out for a while. If that was the bank's intention, it worked.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The January rate hike that was previously baked into bond market prices has now effectively been pushed back to the March rate announcement.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Mr. Poloz himself doesn't have the same luxury of time. He has a speech and news conference in Toronto on Thursday morning, when he will be expected to explain himself. His words over the next 24 hours will tell us just how much the second oil shock of his tenure has shaken the central bank's economic and rate outlook.</p>

<span class="companylink">National Bank of Canada</span> is touting its heavy exposure to Quebec amid a shifting national economic outlook, arguing that recent strength in its home province will be a boon to its bottom line in the near future.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“As a superregional bank with leading market share in Quebec, we are well positioned to benefit from the strength of the Quebec economy," chief executive Louis Vachon said on a conference call on Wednesday to discuss the bank's fourth-quarter results. “Unemployment has been at historical lows for several years, business confidence is high and the province has recorded three consecutive budget surpluses." The narrative marks a significant shift for the country's sixth-largest lender. Montreal-based <span class="companylink">National Bank</span> spent years pushing west, hoping to increase its market share in provinces such as Ontario and Alberta. Today, however, Quebec's economy is glowing and the lender is happy to proclaim its exposure.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the moment, <span class="companylink">National Bank</span> generates about 60 per cent of its revenue in Quebec. In fiscal 2018, <span class="companylink">National Bank</span>'s profit jumped 10 per cent to $2.2-billion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The bank's return on equity sits at 18.4 per cent, which is the highest of the Big Six banks – largely due to its domestic exposure. ROEs are much higher in Canada and the five rival banks have all been boosting their footprints outside of their home borders.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Five years ago, <span class="companylink">National Bank</span> was much more focused on playing down its exposure to traditional banking in its home province. Quebec was highly indebted and Alberta seemed to be the country's growth engine. To expand, <span class="companylink">National Bank</span> made a splash lending to junior oil and gas companies and its financialmarkets arm was often thought of as its strength, largely because of its respected derivatives business.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Almost the exact opposite is true today. While <span class="companylink">National Bank</span> still has energy exposure, its loans to the sector as a percentage of its total portfolio has been chopped in half since 2016, and last year, revenues from wealth management topped those from the financial-markets division for the first time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For the next few years, <span class="companylink">National Bank</span> is counting on traditional banking from its home province to bolster its profit. “Looking forward, we'll maintain our overweight position in Quebec in secured lending and in commercial banking, which we view as favourable in the current economic environment," Mr. Vachon said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">National Bank</span> isn't solely counting on Quebec's strength to grow. The lender has also embarked on a transformation project to make it a much leaner and efficient organization, one that does away with a lot of manual tasks. Ninety per cent of core banking transactions – for example, client bill payments – are now completed using “unassisted channels" such as mobile and online banking.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">National Bank</span>'s efficiency ratio, which measures non-interest expenses as a percentage of total revenues, fell to 54.6 per cent at the end of fiscal 2018. Five years ago, the ratio sat at 58.6 per cent.</p>

<span class="companylink">National Bank</span>'s shares closed at $60.20 on Wednesday, up 14 cents for the day.</p>

<span class="companylink">Canadian Natural Resources Ltd</span>., the country's largest oil and natural gas producer, is slashing capital spending next year by 20 per cent amid low commodity prices and pipeline problems, but said it is ready to reverse the bulk of the cuts if conditions improve.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The company's strategy reflects the uncertainty in the oil business.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The price of Alberta heavy oil crashed earlier this fall, but has rallied. The Alberta government this week said it would order all major oil producers to cut output at the start of January to deal with an oversupply. Capacity to move oil by rail is set to rise, but pipelines are still full.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Canadian Natural said on Wednesday it will spend $3.7-billion in 2019, down some $900-million from $4.6-billion in 2018. Most of the cuts are in its heavy-oil operations. Canadian Natural also said it could turn up spending by about $700-million if market dynamics shift. In such a case, the budget for 2019 could reach about $4.4-billion, down only $200-million, or 4 per cent, from this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Canadian Natural is built to be able to manage through low prices," president Tim McKay told investors on Wednesday as the company detailed its plans.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a news release, Canadian Natural expressed concern about a lack of new pipeline capacity and questioned how the industry itself works. In a statement, Steve Laut, executive vice-chairman, called the process by which oil producers work with pipeline companies to get barrels on the move “dysfunctional."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For the longer-term, Canadian Natural's 2019 budget includes investments in the production of more heavy oil. Two new projects in northeastern Alberta will start operating late next year. One will produce 40,000 barrels a day by 2021, the other about 26,000 barrels a day through 2020. Canadian Natural said in its news release that the timing of both projects fits with expected “improved market access." Pipeline company <span class="companylink">Enbridge Inc</span>. has said the expansion of its Line 3, which goes to the United States, should be open by this time next year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a normal market, Canadian Natural said it would spend upward of $5-billion in a year to generate production growth. That amount would be close to a 10per-cent increase over its 2018 budget.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With its current plans to cut expenditures by 20 per cent, Canadian Natural said its production in 2019 will likely hold steady at about 1.075 million barrels a day.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The one area in 2019 where Canadian Natural plans to notably increase spending is at its oil sands mining and upgrading operations, where it produces a valuable synthetic oil. Expenditures there will be $1.53-billion, up almost 20 per cent from this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Production in 2019 could increase by about 6 per cent to 450,000 barrels a day.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Analyst Jon Morrison of CIBC World Markets said Canadian Natural showed “strong fiscal restraint" with its conservative budget, but also highlighted its ability to “dial spending" higher.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">TD Securities analyst Menno Hulshof noted that Canadian Natural's 2019 spending plan is lower, on a relative basis, than what it spent in 2016, at the depths of the oil bust. The stock price of Canadian Natural rose about 4 per cent on Wednesday to $37.33, up $1.52, in Toronto.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">West Texas Intermediate oil, the North American benchmark, traded at about US$53 a barrel.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Western Canadian Select (WCS), the Alberta heavy-oil benchmark, was going for about US$31 a barrel on Wednesday, according to Net Energy Exchange. The price for WCS dropped as low as about US$10 a barrel this fall.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Canadian Natural is the first major oil company to announce its 2019 plans, an indication of how the oil patch's strategy could unfold in the next year. <span class="companylink">Cenovus Energy Inc</span>., another major producer of heavy oil from the oil sands, will announce its spending plans on Dec. 11, around the same time it does each year. <span class="companylink">Suncor Energy Inc</span>. typically unveils its budget in mid-November, but has not as yet, and now says its decisionmaking has been delayed because of the Alberta government order to cut production.

</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Governor Stephen Poloz and his central bank colleagues pointed to a clutch of negatives now weighing on the Canadian economy that could slow the pace of future rate hikes, including the steep price discount on Canadian crude, uncertainty hanging over business investment and the U.S.-China trade showdown. The bank also highlighted the possibility that the economy could still grow more rapidly without sparking inflation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The persistence of the oil price shock, the evolution of business investments and the bank's assessment of the economy's capacity will also factor into our decisions about the future stance of monetary policy," the bank said in statement on the rate announcement.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Canadian dollar was down more than half a cent in midday trading following the announcement amid fading expectations that the bank will hike again in January.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It isn't quite a “mea culpa or a 180-degree turn," but Mr. Poloz is definitely trying to “walk back" the rate-hike expectations he planted just six weeks ago, said David Rosenberg, chief economist and strategist at Gluskin Sheff in Toronto.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">Bank of Canada</span> isn't likely to stop raising rates because of the oil price slump, but it appears to be in less of a rush than it was, Toronto-Dominion Bank economist Brian DePratto said in a research note.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“While everything points to a January hike being off the table, the path thereafter is less clear," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Poloz will have a chance to clarify the bank's thinking when he delivers a speech in Toronto on Thursday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The BoC's new tone could affect both the pace and the eventual high point for the bank's key interest rate. Before Wednesday, investors had priced in a roughly 64-per-cent chance that the central bank would hike by a quarter of a percentage point on Jan. 9, when it releases its next set of forecasts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists had expected up to three rate increases in 2019.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Trouble in the oil patch has apparently disrupted that narrative.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The BoC said the oil price shock and Alberta's decision this week to curb production means “activity in Canada's energy sector will likely be materially weaker than expected."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A January hike is now dependent on “much better economic data for October" plus a production cut from the <span class="companylink">Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries</span>, CIBC chief economist Avery Shenfeld said in a research note.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Heavy crude from the Alberta and Saskatchewan oil sands has been selling at near record-low levels in recent weeks amid a widening price gap with the North American oil benchmark, West Texas Intermediate. The price of heavy crude, which had tumbled to less than US$15 a barrel, has since bounced back to more than US$28 a barrel. But transportation bottlenecks and high inventories remain a serious problem for the Canadian industry.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The BoC had previously said it was on a course to raise its rate to what's called a neutral level – where it is neither spurring economic activity, nor slowing it down. The central bank has estimated that its neutral rate is between 2.5 per cent and 3.5 per cent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many economists assumed neutral was probably the midway point of 3 per cent, but after a recent speech in Britain, Mr. Poloz suggested that neutral is a moving target. The neutral rate, he told reporters, is “sufficiently uncertain" and “in principle, movable."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“All we know is that as we get closer to it, whatever it is, we'll begin to see signs that we're no longer stimulating demand," he explained at the time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The bank may be leaning toward the lower end of its range.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The statement pointed out that recent “downward historical revisions by <span class="companylink">Statistics Canada</span> to GDP, together with recent macroeconomic developments, indicate there may be more room for non-inflationary growth."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Should prices improve and stabilize, and we see clarity on market access, we would look to increase our capital to approximately $4.4 billion."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A glut of oil in Alberta as pipeline capacity fails to match production increases is blamed for dramatically lower local oil prices since last fall.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Analysts praised the budget for its restraint in the current oil price environment and Canadian Natural shares rose by about 4.5 per cent in early afternoon trading on the Toronto Stock Exchange.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 2019 budget contains $600 million for longterm growth projects, including the completion of the 40,000-barrel-per-day steam-driven Kirby North oilsands project (expected to deliver first oil in late 2019) and building additional multi-well pads at Canadian Natural's Primrose thermal heavy oil project in northern Alberta.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Production in 2019 is targeted to be between 1.03 million and 1.12 million barrels of oil equivalent per day, down slightly from this year's expected output, with a product mix of about 76 per cent oil and natural gas liquids and 24 per cent dry natural gas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A production curtailment program announced by the Alberta government last weekend designed to remove 325,000 barrels per day of oil from the province's overtaxed pipelines has already resulted in stronger forward crude prices in January, Canadian Natural said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It plans to monitor those prices and the progress of the stalled Keystone XL and Trans Mountain expansion export pipelines to determine if spending should be increased.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Technology and options to increase future oil production took centre stage at the investor day, with Scott Stauth, chief operating officer for oilsands, fleshing out Canadian Natural's plan revealed last spring to test driverless oilsands mining trucks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The autonomous haulers are already in place at rival <span class="companylink">Suncor Energy Inc</span>.'s mines and <span class="companylink">Imperial Oil Ltd</span>. said recently it plans to experiment with up to seven of the trucks at its Kearl mine.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Canadian Natural plans to spend about $75 million on a field trial at its Jackpine Mine in late 2020, Stauth said. Canadian Natural has 18 trucks at Jackpine and a total of about 140 at all three mines.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The company is encouraged by results from its 500-tonne-per-hour pilot project to separate bitumen from sand in the mining pit using a portable processing unit, rather than transporting it to a central processing facility, and plans to continue to test it in 2019 before building a larger commercial-sized plant in 2020, Stauth said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The technology could reduce mining costs by $2 to $3 per barrel, cut greenhouse gas emissions "significantly" through less trucking, and reduce the need for tailings ponds, he said.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, who was taking part in a gender equality panel at the G20 in Argentina, spoke about the "gender impacts when you bring construction workers into a rural area," he struck a nerve among many in a province that's bracing for potential layoffs in the oil industry.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Alberta politicians slammed Trudeau on social media for impugning the good name of oil workers. But, despite the furor, it's not clear what exactly Trudeau meant - or whether what people think he said has any basis in fact. Here's a look at how the controversy unfolded.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q What exactly did Trudeau say?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"So, there's all sorts of shifts we're making because we know that you cannot succeed as a society if you are holding back half of your population. And looking at all the different barriers and moving forward on reducing them, on eliminating them as well as, as a government body, looking at how every different decision can have an impact on women in a positive or a negative way. Even big infrastructure projects, you know, might now say, well, what does a gender lens have to do with building this new highway or this new pipeline or something? Well, you know, there are gender impacts when you bring construction workers into a rural area. There are social impacts because they're mostly male construction workers. How are you adjusting and adapting to those? That's what the gender lens in GBA-plus budgeting is all about. These are all things that we've been doing, not to be nice or to be better or to be moral, but to be smart about getting the very best out of all of our citizens and making the very best out of our economy, because women entrepreneurs tend to make better choices than others - we've seen it study after study."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q What did he mean?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An official with the Prime Minister's Office said Trudeau wasn't actually making the point that everyone thinks he's making - that rural communities suffer when male construction workers move in. Instead, he was arguing it's necessary for more women to share in lucrative jobs in the construction industry. Trudeau's quotes are being taken out of context, the official said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q How did his critics interpret his comments?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The condemnation rolled in from Canadian conservatives.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The person who is a threat to rural Canada is Justin Trudeau himself, not the workers who build communities everywhere," Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer said in a tweet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Calgary MP Michelle Rempel called for Trudeau to apologize for his "out of touch characterization" of Alberta workers. "I doubt if he has ever worked a day of labour in his life," Rempel wrote on <span class="companylink">Twitter</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Alberta's opposition leader Jason Kenney criticized Trudeau's "attack" on oil workers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Justin Trudeau says pipelines must go through a 'gender based analysis'because male construction workers have 'impacts.'Darned right they do. They build things, create wealth, pay taxes, take care of their families. But this trust fund millionaire thinks they can't be trusted," the United Conservative Party leader tweeted.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q Wait, was Trudeau even talking about oil workers?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While Trudeau's comments were taken in some quarters as an attack on oil workers, what he actually said was that there should be gender-based analysis of "this new highway or this new pipeline," and that construction workers are "mostly male." So while the assumption could be made that this refers to those building pipelines, he didn't actually specify people working in the Alberta oilpatch.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q Did Trudeau have a point?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Susan Manning, a PhD candidate at <span class="companylink">Dalhousie University</span> and researcher with Feminist Northern Network, said it's "totally true" that there are social impacts of energy extraction projects, but they're wide-ranging and some of them are positive. There are often more jobs for locals, for example.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">However, the influx of workers also means that housing - often limited in small communities - is snapped up and prices may spike. Take the Regional Municipality of Wood Buffalo, where Fort McMurray is located. Its average rental housing price, according to the Canadian Rental Housing Index, is $1,802 per month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There's also some research that a spike in male workers could result in an increase in sexual and violent crimes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Research from the <span class="companylink">University of North Dakota</span>, for example, found that there were statistically significant increases in violence during the oil boom in North Dakota's Bakken region. Between 2005 and 2014, rates of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, and stalking went from less than 50 per 100,000 to more than 70 per 100,000 people.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the Post could not find similar research conducted in Alberta.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In fact, Wood Buffalo released a report in 2014, arguing that crime rates were unexceptional. The homicide rate was 0.86 per 100,000 in 2012, compared to the national rate of 1.56.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The reality, Manning said, is that there are those who benefit and those who don't when workers move into a rural town.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Thinking about who those people are, and why that is the case, is something that's really important," Manning said.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">OTTAWA — Wrangling over the agenda doesn't bode well for Friday's first ministers' meeting, which is shaping up as one of the most fractious gatherings of Canada's federal, provincial and territorial leaders in decades.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is bracing for a barrage of criticism from premiers upset about the federal approach to pipelines, carbon taxation, environmental assessments, GM's Oshawa plant closure in Ontario and the oil price crisis — none of which are specifically on the agenda.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, federal officials privately concede little headway is likely to be made on the official objective of the Montreal meeting: reducing interprovincial trade barriers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Indeed, the feds are fully expecting the most openly hostile premier — Ontario's Doug Ford — will do his best to derail the meeting altogether, including potentially storming out of the gathering or possibly even boycotting it outright. Trudeau is scheduled to hold a 30-minute bilateral meeting with <span class="companylink">Ford</span> on Thursday afternoon.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Federal suspicions have been stoked by what insiders say are the hardball games <span class="companylink">Ford</span> and Saskatchewan Premier Scott Moe are playing on the agenda, demanding that it be expanded in writing to include the oil price crisis and the planned federal tax on carbon pollution.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to sources familiar with the dispute, who were not authorized to speak publicly, the pair have not been satisfied by the federal response that the agenda already includes a discussion on economic competitiveness — a broad topic that Ottawa says will allow premiers to raise all the issues they please.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Moe confirmed in an interview Wednesday that there is "some frustration, myself included, with the agenda provided by the prime minister," which includes having several federal ministers address the premiers on their initiatives.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He said he intends to raise the oil price crisis, the carbon tax, pipelines and repeal of Bill C-69, which re-writes the rules for environmental assessments of energy projects.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We'd like it in writing, confirm that we're going to discuss those items. But rest assured that the premier of the province of Saskatchewan will bring those items to the floor (regardless)," Moe said, adding that he doesn't intend to leave the meeting early.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even the guest list for a pre-meeting dinner hosted by Trudeau on Thursday evening has become a matter of dispute. The feds proposed that it be a private affair for first ministers only, with a single notetaker present. The premiers demanded that each be allowed to bring one official.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This will be the fourth first ministers' meeting Trudeau has hosted since becoming prime minister in 2015. And it's certain to be the most acrimonious.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since first ministers' last met, the prime minister has lost several of his most reliable provincial Liberal allies — Ontario's Kathleen Wynne, Quebec's Philippe Couillard and New Brunswick's Brian Gallant.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He now faces a phalanx of conservative premiers, four of whom — <span class="companylink">Ford</span>, Moe, Manitoba's Brian Pallister and New Brunswick's Blaine Higgs — have joined in court challenges to the federal carbon pricing plan and one of whom — <span class="companylink">Ford</span> — has routinely engaged in conflicts with the federal Liberals in general.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Alberta's NDP Premier Rachel Notley was initially an ally for Trudeau, supporting him on carbon pricing. But she parted company last summer over the failure to get the Trans Mountain pipeline expansion project off the ground and is now crusading for federal help to ease the discount price Alberta is obliged to accept for its oil because it can't get it to tidewater for shipment overseas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She and Moe sent Trudeau a letter this week, asking that the agenda for the first ministers' meeting be revised to include the oil price crisis, which they argued is costing the country $80 million per day.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And Notley disparaged the federal government's preferred focus on interprovincial trade barriers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We tend to have conversations about minor internal trade issues and then when it's my opportunity to talk, I say, 'Well, there's one big internal trade issue that we have about getting our product from one province to another and to other markets and it's actually worth 100 times the value of these other issues,'" she said Tuesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Trudeau said Wednesday that he looks forward to "talking about anything the premiers want to talk about."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I'm looking forward to a broad range of discussions on whatever it is they have as priorities," he said on his way into the House of Commons. "Including oil, of course. Natural resources are an essential part of our economy. We're going to be talking about that as well."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Notley, Moe and a number of other premiers, including Newfoundland and Labrador's Dwight Ball and Nova Scotia's Stephen McNeil, also want to talk about Bill C-69, federal legislation that is currently stalled in the Senate and which would set more stringent rules for environmental assessments of energy projects. Critics maintain it will create more red tape and delays in project approvals that will scare off potential investors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We are looking for clarity around Bill C-69," Ball said in an interview, adding that it's creating uncertainty in his province's offshore oil and mining industries.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We know that the regulatory regime can be an impediment in attracting investment."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a similar vein, Biggs said he wants to talk about reviving the defunct Energy East pipeline proposal, which <span class="companylink">TransCanada</span> abandoned last year, citing regulatory hurdles and changed circumstances.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Quebec Premier Francois Legault, meanwhile, said he wants to talk about continuing U.S. tariffs on Canadian steel and aluminum and compensation for dairy farmers hurt by the new <span class="companylink">NAFTA</span>. In a statement Wednesday, he also said he intends to raise Quebec's demand for federal compensation to cover the cost of the influx of irregular asylum seekers and press Ottawa on the "excessive and ever longer" time taken to address Quebec's files.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Manitoba's Pallister is among the few premiers who appear to actually want to make progress on knocking down interprovincial trade barriers — barriers he said amount to imposing a seven per cent tariff on goods that cross provincial borders.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I think it's time to strike on that," he said Wednesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That said, Pallister too said the meeting needs to be narrowly focused on a few key economic issues, including the oil price crisis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">First ministers are to meet for two hours with Indigenous leaders Friday morning before holing up behind closed doors for some six hours with Trudeau.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lush, based in the United Kingdom, has been critical of the oil industry for years. In June 2012, it began a series of advocacy campaigns in Canada and the United States that called for an end to the expansion of pipelines and pointed out the environmental risks behind Alberta's oilsands. But in recent weeks, a social media campaign has called for a boycott of the company on this basis, claiming it is causing Albertans to lose oil-and-gas jobs.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Our campaign to boycott Lush and raise awareness for their campaign to help Albertans lose jobs is based on the severe economic situation we find ourselves in Alberta currently,” said a message from the administrator of Pipeline Action, the pro-oil industry <span class="companylink">Facebook</span> page, to StarMetro.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The administrator also said in their message that Lush has stores in Saudi Arabia (it has three), “who are the ultimate beneficiaries of Canadian Oil losing its market hold.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">Facebook</span> page posted the phone numbers for the Lush stores at Chinook Centre, Market Mall, Sunridge Mall — all in Calgary — and Cross Iron Mills, just north of the city's limits. It posted a series of private messages sent to them by someone Pipeline Action claimed was the store manager at Lush's Chinook location, asking them to stop harassing its Calgary-based employees.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">Lush Cosmetics</span> has not responded to requests for comment from StarMetro concerning the boycott campaign and the alleged harassment of employees. The administrator of Pipeline Action said in their message to StarMetro that no reports had been made to police concerning the alleged harassment of Lush employees and suggested any allegations “were from a few dramatic social media posts by people who disagree with us.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Calgary Police Service said it was unable to confirm whether a harassment complaint had been filed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since posting about the boycott call last Thursday, hundreds of people have either liked, shared, or commented on the page. Just over 2,000 signatures have been collected on an online petition campaign hosted by Canada Action. And several prominent Calgarians have also shown their support for the campaign on their social media accounts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I am certain that this brand is NOT WELCOME in Alberta. Or Saskatchewan,” wrote Brett Wilson, an entrepreneur and cannabis investor, on <span class="companylink">Twitter</span>. “And frankly — suspect that shutting down operations in Canada would be their best move.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Councillor Sean Chu also voiced his displeasure with Lush on <span class="companylink">Twitter</span>, suggesting it was insulting given unemployment rates in Alberta.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I'm boycotting this company and you should, too,” he wrote last Thursday.</p>

Neil Bruce saw his luck run out at precisely 9:46 a.m., Ottawa time, on Aug. 2, when Foreign Affairs Minister Chrystia Freeland published her now-famous tweet about Saudi Arabia.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The tweet seemed innocent enough. Freeland “strongly” called for the release of detained Saudi dissidents Raif and Samar Badawi. But the Saudi regime went ballistic at what it viewed as Canadian interference in its domestic affairs. The Canadian ambassador in Riyadh was kicked out, and thousands of Saudi students were ordered to leave Canada. Saudi Arabia froze all new trade with Canada and instructed its investment arms to unload Canadian holdings at any price.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Until then, Bruce had been on a terrific run at Montreal-based engineering and construction giant <span class="companylink">SNC-Lavalin</span>. The Scotsman had spent the past three years tweaking, buying, selling, hiring, firing and refocusing in the wake of its debilitating corruption scandal. Investors loved his work—until Freeland's tweet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While many diplomats assumed the Saudis regarded Canada as a “soft target,” meaning they could make an example of Canada without inflicting much damage on the Saudi economy, the incident nonetheless triggered spasms of anxiety within SNC, a feeling reinforced by a sharp fall in the share price. Saudi Arabia accounted for 11% of SNC’s revenues and had been a big growth area. The company had 9,100 employees in Saudi Arabia and had been a corporate fixture in the country for 50 years. <span class="companylink">Saudi Aramco</span>, the world’s biggest oil company, was among its clients. This was one market SNC could not afford to lose, and Canada was isolated. No other country was coming out in support of Freeland’s stance.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The Saudis threatened to stop working with any Canadian company,” Bruce said in late September, over lunch in London. “It provided a whole bunch of instability. It’s ongoing, it’s not resolved. We’re trying to work our way through it with the clients and hoping they don’t say, ‘We don’t want to work with you.’“</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But only two weeks after that interview, another incident displaced Saudi Arabia as SNC’s top problem. In Canada, SNC failed to secure a deferred prosecution agreement (DPA), a negotiated settlement used in some other G7 countries that likely would have seen criminal charges against the company stayed in exchange for fines and a demonstrated commitment to toughen up ethics and compliance standards. Bruce was shocked. He had been optimistic a DPA would land on his lap, capping a magical turnaround story. With no DPA, SNC faces a criminal trial that could thrust it into legal uncertainty for years; a conviction could severely damage, even kill, SNC’s ability to win government contracts in Canada for up to 10 years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The DPA letdown marked Bruce's first significant defeat at SNC. Until then, his strategic overhaul of the company had gone admirably well, thrusting it into the top ranks of the global engineering and construction (E&C) industry after making two big acquisitions, ditching workaday businesses and recruiting a team of international executives determined to play in the big leagues.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SNC was landing big-name projects, including the REM, an electric light-rail project for greater Montreal; the decommissioning of the Saskatchewan Research Council's Slowpoke-2 nuclear reactor; and full engineering services for one of the world's largest sulphuric acid plants, in Saudi Arabia.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Before learning on Oct. 10 that the DPA would go missing, Bruce said he wanted to push SNC all the way to the top: “I think Canada having a global champion—No. 1—is possible.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now, you can't help but wonder: Has Bruce built up SNC only to have to tear it down again?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On a warm day in April 2012, in a chaotic suburb of Tunis, my Arabic interpreter and I banged on the door of a small, modern office that housed Orbit Media and asked to see Baya Ben Aïssa. We were led to a desk where a petite woman in her 70s identified herself as Orbit’s owner and confirmed she was the mother of Riadh Ben Aïssa.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We—a small team of journalists at The Globe and Mail—had been trying to find Riadh Ben Aïssa for weeks and had no idea whether he was in his native Tunisia, in Canada or somewhere in between. What we did know was that he was at the centre of a corruption scandal that would bludgeon SNC, one of the country’s few corporate flag-bearers overseas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A couple of months earlier, Ben Aïssa, who was SNC's global construction chief and, apparently, North Africa and Middle East fixer extraordinaire, had been drummed out of SNC, accused of making $56 million in payments to unknown commercial agents to help win contracts. Libyan strongman Moammar Gadhafi was among his clients, and SNC was building Gadhafi a 4,000-inmate prison just as the Libyan revolution erupted. That cozy relationship ended in October 2011, when Gadhafi was hauled out of a drainage pipe and assassinated.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Earlier in the day, we had found Ben Aïssa’s expansive villa in the wealthy suburb of Carthage, just beyond Tunis, but the armed guards at both ends of the street prevented us from making a gracious visit. Later, at Orbit, which sold computers and other office items and which shared the same address as SNC’s Tunisian office, Baya grew suspicious when we asked about her relationship with SNC and the whereabouts of her son. Standing erect and crossing her arms, she said, “I don’t work for SNC anymore.” As for her son, “There are false rumours in the Canadian press about him. Very false.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A couple of heavy-duty men invited us to hit the road.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ben Aïssa, as it turned out, was not in Tunisia. Unbeknownst to us, he'd been detained by Swiss police not long before I arrived in Tunis. He was later extradited to Canada, where he would face a criminal trial. In July, fully six years later, he pleaded guilty to one charge of using forged documents related to the infamous McGill University Health Centre (MUHC) bid-rigging scandal, one of the biggest fraud cases in Canadian history.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The case centred on an alleged $22.5-million payment from SNC to a Bahamas company called Sierra Asset Management. Quebec investigators alleged that Ben Aïssa and Pierre Duhaime, who was SNC’s CEO when the corruption scandals erupted, were behind the secret payments to secure the $1.3-billion contract to build the MUHC. Payments were allegedly received by Arthur Porter, the late CEO of the MUHC.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some 15 other charges against Ben Aïssa were dropped. Since he had already spent 29 months in prison and more than three years wearing a tracking device, he was released. Next in the dock is Duhaime, whose trial is set to begin in January.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But SNC itself wasn't off the hook. In 2015, the RCMP charged SNC with fraud and corruption related to an alleged $48 million in bribes paid to Libyan officials (among them one of Gadhafi's sons) and defrauding various Libyan organizations of $130 million. Two years earlier, the <span class="companylink">World Bank</span> had banned <span class="companylink">SNC-Lavalin Inc</span>. and its affiliates from taking part in <span class="companylink">World Bank</span>—financed contracts for up to 10 years because of “misconduct"—conspiracy to pay bribes—related to the multibillion-dollar contract to build the Padma Bridge in Bangladesh.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">None of these scandals happened under Bruce's watch, but they would stalk him as he was trying to reinvent Canada's premier E&C company.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Neil Bruce is virtually unknown outside of the E&C industry, where he is very well known.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Among average Canadians, even among senior executives, he is a low-profile boss, partly by choice—he is intensely private and avoids social media—and partly because he is a foreigner who is not part of the Toronto corporate power base, which considers Montreal an outpost. Born in Scotland, he joined SNC in 2013 as president of its resources, environment and water group. He is an outsider and seems entirely comfortable in that role.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I met Bruce for the first time in late September near Piccadilly, in the heart of London, at Mash, an American-style steak restaurant with an elegant Art Deco interior—my choice. The place was perfect for a long chat over lunch: It's never overwhelmed by midday crowds, it's tucked in the bowels of a sturdy old building on Brewer Street, away from the street noise, and the waiters are pleasantly unchatty.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bruce could pass for an aging Marine or SAS officer, with his close-cropped, pepper-grey hair—almost a buzz cut—stout physique and lively blue-grey eyes. At 58, he still looks like he could casually knock the next guy's lights out in a pub brawl. But on that day, he was not guzzling anything but sparkling water. He ordered the sea bream, never mind that this was a steak joint.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bruce doesn't dress like a CEO. He almost never wears a tie, but arrived at lunch in a crisp white shirt and restrained grey suit that whispered middle management. He was still obviously Scottish—the pitch of his vowels was unmistakably so—even though he has spent most of his career outside of Scotland. He said “whilst,” not “while,” and “goot” instead of “good.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He reinforces the cliché that Scots are tightwads. There are no company cars or jets even though SNC has operations in more than 50 countries. Ian Edwards, the Brit who is president of SNC's infrastructure sector—the Bruce era has seen an influx of Brits—says the boss takes a dim view of executives who run fat expense accounts. “If we go for dinner as a group, it's never extravagant,” Edwards says. “We would never order expensive wine.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Bruce does have his extravagances. He's a Formula 1 nut and adores the <span class="companylink">McLaren Racing</span> team. At times, he has owned expensive sports cars, including a classic Ferrari 328, a Porsche 911 and three <span class="companylink">BMW</span> M5s. Today, he drives a Range Rover SUV because he and his English partner, Emma, an investment banker, have a seven-year-old daughter, Daisy, who needs ferrying around Montreal and to the ski slopes. While they consider Montreal their home, they keep a house near Henley-on-Thames in south Oxfordshire, west of London.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The three sector presidents I interviewed all had similar views of Bruce: He’s refreshingly direct and transparent, has no big ego, is a strategic thinker, isn’t chatty—you have to read his facial expressions for clues of approval or disapproval—lacks the control-freak gene and gives his executives ample autonomy, offering “gentle oversight,” as one of them puts it. “He’s the best strategic thinker I have ever seen,” says Christian Brown, the East Yorkshireman who is president of SNC’s oil and gas business. “He’s probably the best boss I have ever worked for.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Edwards says Bruce is a bit of a loner; he tends not to engage closely with his lieutenants when making big decisions until it's really necessary. “I believe this is part of his approach to empower and enable this team to focus while he gets on with his own job of running the company,” Edwards says. “The biggest thing he did was empower management.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bruce had a happy childhood that was marred by one tragedy: the death of his mother, Margaret, from a blood disorder when he was in his early teens. At the time, the Bruce family was living just south of Aberdeen, the grey-granite port city in northeast Scotland that would grow wealthy after the North Sea turned into an oil gusher in the 1970s. Bruce's father, Graeme, now in his late 70s, was a factory engineer and transformed himself into a United Free Church of Scotland minister just before his wife's death. “Our parents taught us all the basics,” Bruce says. “It was about education, integrity, fairness, how to treat people.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">His first job was at <span class="companylink">Brown & Root</span>, an industrial services company, where he worked on offshore oil projects. His career highlights include the oil company <span class="companylink">Atlantic Richfield</span>, where he was construction director, and Amec (now <span class="companylink">Amec Foster Wheeler</span>), a British project engineering company, where he was responsible for the resources division, including its work in the Alberta oil sands. As Amec's chief operating officer and executive director between 2009 and 2012, he pretty much ran the show, and that distinction landed him in trouble with the then CEO, Samir Brikho.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After 14 years, he resigned. Then a storied but disgraced Canadian E&C company called <span class="companylink">SNC-Lavalin</span>, born in 1911 and associated with some of Canada's most famous engineering projects, including the James Bay hydroelectric system, came knocking.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By then, Duhaime had been tossed, and SNC was being run by Robert Card, a hard-ass American civil and environmental engineer who had served as deputy undersecretary of energy in the early years of the George W. Bush presidency. Card had been charged with the ruthless revamp of SNC’s ethics and compliance standards and swept the broom through the management suite (some 10,000 Canadian employees left SNC during the crisis years, most voluntarily, due to the cloud of uncertainty hanging over the company). SNC needed to recruit an executive or two with the potential to replace Card when he finished his cleanup.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At first, Bruce thought: “You’ve got to be kidding. SNC has all blown up. Why would I want to join a French-Canadian company with ethics and compliance issues?”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Curiosity got the better of him, and he soon figured out that while SNC had a dire reputation problem, it was no financial basket case. That meant the company would not require a full-scale rescue mission, even if it needed a major tune-up. “When you have a company that needs a turnaround, it normally has a weak balance sheet, but that wasn’t the issue at SNC,” he says. “SNC was a combination of a decent balance sheet and a very loyal shareholder base, like the Caisse [de dépôt et placement du Québec], that wanted to see the company survive and come out the other end.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He joined SNC in 2013 and went on the strategic offensive while Card, as CEO, played defence with a top-to-bottom ethics and compliance fix-it job, which included banning the company from doing business in countries that occupied the bottom ranks of <span class="companylink">Transparency International</span>’s corruption rankings and banning the use of agents except in countries where they were legally required. Agents are typically local “business partners” who take payments to help secure contracts. In the global contracting world, it is widely known that these payments can in effect be bribes. “There’s 10 times as much work we can do with great customers, with clean customers, in areas of the world where we don’t have to get involved in bribery,” Bruce says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bruce's strategic assessment was that SNC was toiling away in a few businesses it shouldn't be and was largely absent from one business where it should, which was oil and gas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bruce also determined that SNC relied too heavily on two sectors—infrastructure and mining—the latter always risky because it’s a feast-or-famine industry. Within infrastructure, he figured SNC was wasting its time on civil contracts, such as engineering-lite office buildings and hospitals, where it had no competitive edge and lousy margins, and was competing with efficient construction companies. The civil business was wound down, and three other businesses that weren’t making much money and never would—building management services, French construction engineering and thermal power—were either sold or are being wound down.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bruce decided that SNC should concentrate on big, long-life, complex projects, such as rail systems, where it could leverage its engineering expertise, faced fewer competitors and, in some cases, could take a piece of the action, as it did with Ontario's enormously profitable Highway 407 toll road, which is 17% owned by SNC (a stake that will soon be sold down to 10% as part of a balance sheet health upgrade). “We can design them, build them and operate them,” he says, describing the ideal SNC project.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To fill the oil and gas hole, in 2014 he bought Kentz, an Irish-born oil and gas and petrochemicals engineering group that was listed on the <span class="companylink">London Stock Exchange</span>, for $2.1 billion. Kentz boosted employment in SNC's oil and gas division from about 3,000 to 20,000, making it the company's biggest business and giving it a competitive edge in energy projects around the world.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The biggie came two years later, when Bruce paid $3.5 billion for <span class="companylink">WS Atkins</span>, Britain's top engineering consultancy and one of the world's leading design and project engineering businesses. In its fiscal year, Atkins had revenues of £1.86 billion (about $3 billion) and some 18,000 employees in more than three dozen countries, making it about half the size of SNC at the time. Among Atkins's notable projects were the engineering design for the London 2012 Olympics, the architectural design for <span class="companylink">Royal Caribbean</span>'s monster Oasis of the Seas cruise ship, and construction management for the overhaul of the Statue of Liberty site.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For Bruce, Atkins’s real attraction was its nuclear power plant decommissioning business, whose work in the United States and Europe was thriving as old plants were dismantled. The Atkins nuclear unit fit well with SNC’s own nuclear business, which was also involved in decommissioning work as well as reactor upgrades for the <span class="companylink">Bruce Power</span> and <span class="companylink">Ontario Power Generation</span> reactors (SNC owns the licence for the Canadiandeveloped Candu reactor technology). Bruce says SNC’s nuclear division, with Atkins in the family fold, accounts for about 10% of the company’s business and could easily double in the next decade. “Nuclear for us is fantastic,” he says. “Today, we’re sitting on a nuclear business that is truly world class.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With Kentz and Atkins tucked into the portfolio and the low-margin businesses shunted out the door, by 2017 SNC was putting a smile on Bruce's face—a relatively rare phenomenon. As a bonus, the company would soon settle a $1-billion class-action lawsuit related to corruption allegations in Libya, for a deep-discount $88 million. Even the threat of a criminal trial seemed to be on the wane as Canada signalled it would bring in DPA legislation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Under Bruce, SNC had essentially become a new company. The top management had been entirely replaced, as had the board of directors. Bruce had reshaped its business, giving it international bulk in six areas: oil and gas; engineering, design and project management; infrastructure; nuclear; clean power (including renewable energy); and mining, which started coming out of a cyclical slump last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Analysts were getting the message that SNC had been reinvented, and the “buy” recommendations reappeared. When Bruce went from chief operating officer to CEO in October 2015, the shares were trading at about $40. By mid-2017, they were above $55, and halfway through 2018, they breached $60, valuing the company at almost $11 billion. In the 2017 fiscal year, the company reported $382 million in net income attributable to shareholders, up 50% over the previous year, on revenue of $9.3 billion. The order backlog stood at an impressive $10.4 billion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When Bruce took over SNC, the company had 35,000 employees. By the end of 2017, it had 52,000 (that number is unchanged today). SNC had become a big, profitable company that was going places, and employee morale began to improve, not just because the crisis years were fading from view, but because, under Bruce, the pressure from the ethics and compliance clampdown unleashed by Card began to ease off.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Marie-Claude Dumas, president of the clean power sector, joined SNC in 2006 and is one of the few senior executives to have survived the upheaval under Card and Bruce. She says there’s no comparing the old, pre-crisis SNC and the new one. She describes SNC under Duhaime, who spent 20 years at SNC before being named CEO in 2009, as “extremely decentralized,” implying that it was run like a collection of fiefdoms.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Every project manager was like a king or queen, and they were free to do their jobs as they saw fit,” says Dumas. “When he arrived, Bob Card was in crisis management mode, and his focus was on putting in place a first-tier ethics and compliance program. The program was strict. You couldn't even take a client out for a coffee without permission.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dumas was happy when Bruce took over the show. “When he came on board, he was able to bring the pendulum back a bit,” she says. “It's a relief to be a normal company again, focusing on the business and clients.” As for Bruce as a manager, she says, “he's very transparent. He's a great boss, and he believes in his people.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So far, so good. The Bruce era was paying dividends. The winddown of austerity in Europe and Donald Trump's promises to repair clapped-out bridges, roads and ports meant infrastructure spending had nowhere to go but up. Commodity prices were rising, allowing finance bosses to crack open mining and energy development budgets. With all the baddies vanquished from SNC, the corruption crisis was fading and the final cleansing event—the DPA—seemed to be on its way. What could go wrong?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The missing DPA enraged Bruce. He had been optimistic that an agreement protecting the company from a criminal trial was in the bag, all the more so since the federal government had introduced legislation to allow such agreements just a few months earlier. DPAs are used in the United States, Britain and other countries in the belief that it’s often unfair to punish a company and its employees as a whole if the wrongdoing was the handiwork of a few executives or employees.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SNC shares plunged 14% on Oct. 10, the day the company disclosed that no DPA was coming. The following week, Bruce took out full-page ads in leading newspapers to appeal to Canadians for support in the hope of getting the agreement back on the table. “The debate is about what is right for this country,” he wrote, a subtle hint that going after SNC itself, as opposed to the individual sleazoids responsible for the corruption, would risk 9,000 Canadian jobs and perhaps even the Montreal head office, if the sagging share price were to lure bargain-hunting takeover artists.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, Bruce was praying for the best in Saudi Arabia. After Freeland’s tweet, SNC’s bidding on a few Saudi contracts in mining, oil and gas, and infrastructure was “put on hold,” he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But nothing truly devastating happened and, after the murder of Saudi dissident journalist Jamal Khashoggi on Oct. 2 in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul, it was Saudi Arabia's turn to be isolated. The whole world was critical of the kingdom, not just Canada. At that point, the Saudis seemed to have more important things to do than beat up on Canadian diplomats and companies. By the start of November, SNC had not lost any business in Saudi Arabia and actually managed to marginally boost its Saudi employment, which includes more than 1,400 Saudi nationals.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As of late October, Bruce said the company's business “seems to be carrying on as normal.” Whether back-corridor SNC diplomacy managed to stabilize the situation or whether the Saudis were still plotting ways to make life difficult for Canadian companies in Saudi Arabia was not known.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But now, with a looming corruption trial hanging over SNC, Bruce has to be wondering whether the restructuring he has directed for three years will need to be followed by another restructuring—this one designed to prevent equity value from vanishing as the threat of a criminal conviction hangs over the company like the Sword of Damocles. “We do have a Plan B in the works,” he told me after finding out about the DPA. “We have to protect shareholder value. We have various options.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And what would Plan B look like? He wouldn't say, but he didn't deny a Desjardins Capital Markets report that it might include selling the core E&C business in whole or in part; privatizing the company, perhaps with a strategic partner such as a pension fund; or winding down the Canadian operations, which might suffer greatly if any conviction were to land SNC on the federal government's blacklist of contractors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Here he was, he said, a Scotsman who had lived in Canada for only three years, suddenly “fighting to maintain a Canadian icon.” SNC has asked for a judicial review of the Public Prosecution Service's decision, arguing that the service gave SNC no explanation for the rejection and warning that the looming corruption trial would have “extremely negative consequences” on “innocent” employees, investors, suppliers and pensioners. He is evidently playing a political game, gambling that the service would revive the DPA if SNC, without a DPA, faced serious damage.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Indeed, Desjardins analysts in Montreal say SNC's battered share price might make the company a sitting duck. “We believe that SNC could be an attractive takeover target if its valuation remains depressed,” they said in their Oct. 17 report. Bruce confirmed he has revived the restructuring team he'd formed in 2015.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Before the DPA bomb hit, Bruce said his overhaul of SNC was ahead of schedule and largely successful. “The work around the initial five-year plan is pretty much done,” he told me. “The next bit is for the company to get real organic growth.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now, all bets are off. Bruce wanted to be the boss who transformed SNC from national embarrassment to Canadian corporate champion, and the Scotsman almost did it. While he could still achieve his goal—securing a DPA is not out of the question, even if it seems unlikely in the near term—the legacy of certain individuals' reckless behaviour in Libya and Montreal almost a decade ago has ruined his fantasy. Riadh Ben Aïssa, set free, is no doubt a happy man. Neil Bruce is just angry.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The energy sector led by gaining 2.6 per cent on the day followed by materials and industrials, which together account for 40 per cent of the Toronto Stock Exchange.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Markets fell Tuesday after U.S. President Donald Trump indicated his affinity for tariffs. But excitement rose overnight after China said it was optimistic about a trade deal being worked out during the 90-day truce agreed to last weekend by the leaders of both countries, says Michael Currie, vice-president and investment adviser at TD Wealth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"That got people a little bit excited and I think that's carrying over to help the global growth story that's been pretty weak lately and that's really going to help the energy sector," he said in an interview.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Several Canadian energy companies got a boost Wednesday with <span class="companylink">Canadian Natural Resources Ltd</span>. rising 4.2 per cent, <span class="companylink">Suncor Energy Inc</span>. 3.3 per cent, <span class="companylink">Imperial Oil Ltd</span>. 3.1 per cent and <span class="companylink">Cenovus Energy Inc</span>. 2.88 per cent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In addition to hope about global growth, investors anticipate that <span class="companylink">OPEC</span> countries will agree to cut oil production at its meeting Thursday. There is also a carryover from Alberta's decision to cut production levels, he said.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The February gold contract was down $4 at US$1,242.60 per ounce and the March copper contract was up 1.5 cents at $2.77 a pound.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Canadian dollar traded at an average of 74.89 cents US, the lowest level since June 2017 and down from an average of 75.65 cents US on Tuesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The loonie fell after the <span class="companylink">Bank of Canada</span> maintained its trend-setting rate at 1.75 per cent and governor Stephen Poloz took a more dovish tone that reduced betting on a hike in January.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The talk from the <span class="companylink">Bank of Canada</span> seems to be targeting three more rate hikes through the end of 2019," Currie said. "People are betting their money on two."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A slower pace of interest rate increases hurts the loonie because that makes Canada a less attractive place for people outside the country to invest in Canada, he added.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"So if they're expecting rates not to be as high they're less inclined to invest here. They may be able to get better rates somewhere else."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The benchmark Treasury 10-year yield fell to its lowest point since mid-September on Tuesday, while the spread between the 10-year yield over its two-year counterpart also shrank to the smallest since the start of the financial crisis in January 2008. That signalled to some investors an approaching U.S. economic slowdown.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Palladium, on the other hand, surpassed the bullion for the first time in about 16 years, to hit a record high of $1,263.56 per ounce as higher speculative interest and larger supply deficit boosted the auto-catalyst metal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Markets are also bracing for more news on Brexit. British Prime Minister Theresa May suffered embarrassing defeats on Tuesday, the start of five days of parliamentary debate over her plans to leave the <span class="companylink">European Union</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The pound rose off 17-month lows of $1.2659 hit on Tuesday to around $1.2751, up 0.3 per cent on the day, amid creeping optimism that Britain could opt to stay in the <span class="companylink">EU</span> after all.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Canada’s heavy-oil benchmark surged after Alberta announced its crude production cuts – and prices should see “further improvement” in the coming years, according to a research note.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Western Canadian Select catapulted to US$32.91 a barrel on Monday morning, up around US$11 from Friday’s close, as the market immediately priced in the impact of Alberta Premier Rachel Notley’s plan to draw down the province’s crude backlog via production cuts. WCS now stands at around US$29 a barrel, and sells at a US$23.85 discount to the U.S. benchmark, a sharp improvement from a record US$50 differential earlier this fall.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The heady days of US$100 oil aren’t expected any time soon, but Canada’s heavy crude should continue to perk up in 2019 and 2020, according to a report from <span class="companylink">CIBC Capital Markets</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“As excess crude capacity is drawn from storage and supply is no longer a price taker, we can expect further improvement in WCS and Canadian crude differentials,” wrote Joan Pinto, associate and energy specialist at CIBC. Her forecast pegs WCS at an average price of US$40.50 a barrel in 2019 and US$41.75 the following year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Her outlook, however, is contingent on what comes out of this week’s meeting of the <span class="companylink">Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries</span>. “Should OPEC-plus reinstate cuts at their confab later in the week,” she wrote, “we could see further upside in global oil benchmarks, including Canadian grades.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“OPEC-plus” refers to the cartel and non-OPEC producers such as Russia, which had agreed to a previous supply cap and are expected to reinstate supply cuts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Pinto added that building key pipelines – such as the Trans Mountain expansion and Keystone XL – would provide more “sustained upside” to narrow the Canada-U.S. price gaps. “For the long haul, pipelines remain the preferred and environmentally safer mode of exporting our energy resources out to Asian and U.S. markets.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Oil patch producers have struggled to ship product of late, a situation that helped drive Canadian crude to moribund prices, with WCS hitting a record low of less than US$14 a barrel in November. To bolster prices, Ms. Notley on Sunday announced her province would cut production by 8.7 per cent, or roughly 325,000 barrels daily, starting next year to help clear the crude backlog. Once excess storage is drawn down, the production cut will drop to roughly 95,000 barrels daily through the end of 2019. Days earlier, Ms. Notley had unveiled a plan to buy rail cars that would move an additional 120,000 barrels of crude a day out of the province.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The reaction was immediate when markets opened Monday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Rory Johnston, commodity economist at Bank of Nova Scotia, said the WCS surge seemed “more or less right,” but that “we’re not used to seeing the market price in such a definitive change in supply so quickly.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Premier Notley made this [plan] very, very clear,” Mr. Johnston said by phone Monday. “She gave exact numbers, she gave exact timelines, she gave exact ways of benchmarking progress of the plan. I think that level of detail in the announcement really provided the market with a lot of certainty in order for it to price in that move very, very quickly.”</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hoser losers</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Everyone’s picking on the Toronto stock market and Canadian dollar these days.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It’s true that everyone’s got the jitters – witness what happened yesterday – but analysts sure are talking down Canada’s stocks and currency.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Well, at least <span class="companylink">Citigroup</span> puts us among the best of the bad where the benchmark S&P/TSX Composite Index is concerned.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In its latest “attractiveness score” this week, Citi ranks Canada well down the list, just below Austria among the decliners.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Most attractive are the United States, Italy – Italy! – South Korea, Hong Kong and Spain. Least attractive are the Netherlands, Brazil, Switzerland, Malaysia and, at the very bottom, Mexico, our partner in the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bank of Montreal chief economist Douglas Porter noted this week that the TSX, down more than 3.5 per cent in the first 11 months of 2019, has lagged the S&P 500, which is up 5.1 per cent with December left to go, for a very long time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Looking at total returns, Mr. Porter pointed out that the TSX’s better dividend yield “has closed the gap a bit from a straight comparison of the index changes.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It doesn’t look quite as bad, either, if you take a longer-term view.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Going back to the 1990s, the 25-year total returns show a closer race between the two indexes, with the S&P 500 churning out an annualized total return of 9.54 per cent versus 7.82-per-cent for the TSX,” Mr. Porter said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“If we subtract domestic [consumer price index] inflation from both, we get real returns of 7.31 per cent for the S&P 500 and 6.02 per cent for the TSX (both very, very solid).”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Porter’s glass-half-full view: “The TSX has actually not been that far behind the S&P over the long term, and has churned out solid real gains.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Glass-half-empty: “The TSX has indeed underperformed the S&P over almost any reasonable timeframe.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Then there’s the loonie, which can’t seem to crack 76 US cents even with a pickup in oil prices. And it’s not expected to go on a roll any time soon.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Like the economy, the Canadian dollar can’t win for trying,” said Mr. Porter’s colleague, BMO senior economist Sal Guatieri.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The ink was barely dry on the USMCA nine weeks ago when world and domestic oil prices made like Icarus” and plummeted, he added.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“And, any positive vibes businesses were feeling from the accelerated depreciation allowance were quickly snuffed out by GM’s dour news, especially in Ontario.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He was referring to the tax measures federal Finance Minister Bill Morneau outlined in his fiscal update and the announcement by <span class="companylink">General Motors Co</span>. that it’s closing its Oshawa assembly plant.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Then there’s an issue that, along with oil prices, affects the currency, the difference in policy between the <span class="companylink">U.S. Federal Reserve</span> and <span class="companylink">Bank of Canada</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The loonie cowered to below 75 cents US ($1.33) for the first time since June, even as expectations of Fed tightening faded almost as fast as for the <span class="companylink">Bank of Canada</span>,” Mr. Guatieri said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The currency saw little bounce after the official signing of the USMCA by the three leaders on Friday. It’s trade-weighted value is no higher today than two years ago, with or without the greenback, and it is even little changed since the end of the recession.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Okay, here’s one nice thought: <span class="companylink">BMO</span> hasn’t yet “thrown in the towel” on the currency’s outlook.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But a lot has to go right: <span class="companylink">OPEC</span> and its oil allies have to agree to production cuts when they meet Thursday and Friday, the <span class="companylink">U.S. Congress</span> has to ratify the new trade deal, and the U.S. economy has to stay solid, allowing the <span class="companylink">Bank of Canada</span> to continue raising rates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If all that happens, then “the currency should flutter to 78 cents … by late 2019,” Mr. Guatieri said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Of course, if one of these things doesn’t happen, all bets are off,” he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">JPMorgan Chase</span> also weighed in on the loonie this week, with global foreign exchange strategist Daniel Hui noting “we are bearish” on the currency in the near term.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">JPMorgan</span> forecasts a loonie at just above 75 US cents in the first quarter of next year. And when you factor in everything from trade issues to uncertainty in the oil market, the <span class="companylink">Bank of Canada</span> should “reinforce this near-term bearish bias” today, Mr. Hui said.</p>

<span class="companylink">BoC</span> holds, loonie tumbles</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">Bank of Canada</span> held its key rate steady, while pointing to uncertainty in the oil market, sending the loonie tumbling below 75 US cents in the process.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Oil prices have fallen sharply since the October monetary policy report (MPR), reflecting a combination of geopolitical developments, uncertainty about global growth prospects, and expansion of U.S. shale oil production,” the central bank said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Benchmarks for western Canadian oil – both heavy and, more recently, light – have been pulled down even further by transportation constraints and a buildup of inventories. In light of these developments and associated cutbacks in production, activity in Canada’s energy sector will likely be materially weaker than expected.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Those production cuts refer to Alberta Premier Rachel Notley’s decision to order a supply reduction of 325,000 barrels a day beginning next year, which has, since the weekend, driven up the price of western Canadian oil.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The currency fell as the central bank gave no hints as to when the next rate hike will come.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The appropriate pace of rate increases will depend on a number of factors,” Governor Stephen Poloz, senior deputy governor Carolyn Wilkins and their colleagues said as they held the overnight rate at 1.75 per cent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“These include the effect of higher interest rates on consumption and housing, and global trade policy developments. The persistence of the oil price shock, the evolution of business investment, and the bank’s assessment of the economy’s capacity will also factor importantly into our decisions about the future stance of monetary policy.”</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">Canadian Natural Resources Ltd</span>. is cutting its 2019 spending amid what it complains is a “dysfunctional” pipeline approval system.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The company said today its budget calls for spending of $3.7-billion, or about $1-billion below normal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Currently, the lack of market access and a dysfunctional pipeline nomination process are creating industry challenges,” it said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The company added that it’s monitoring Ms. Notley’s supply cuts, and developments connected to two key pipeline projects.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The curtailment program recently announced by the government of Alberta has resulted in the January index prices for crude oil to strengthen significantly,” it said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Canadian Natural will monitor the impact over time of curtailment on prices as well as the progress of the two export pipelines (Keystone XL and Trans Mountain Expansion) in the final stages of approval.
